Post: Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.
True Label: behavior
Predicted Label: behavior
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: "ending my life again", "I want to go to a bridge and jump off."
   - Emotional indicators: "Never will find love", "mental breakdown", "everything in my life is crap even me", "I wish I was even attractive enough for someone", "I hate being gay and I hate being myself."
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: "go to a bridge and jump off." This specifies a method (jumping) and a location (a bridge).
   - References to past attempts: "ending my life again" implies a past recurrence of suicidal thoughts or perhaps an attempt, but the wording "thinking about ending my life again" leans more towards recurring ideation rather than a concrete past attempt. The definition of 'attempt' requires a "concrete action" in the past.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, "ending my life", "jump off".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, "ending my life".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, "go to a bridge and jump off." This is a clear, specific method and location.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The desire to "go to a bridge" indicates an intention to act on the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? "Kind of thinking about ending my life again" refers to current thoughts, possibly recurring. "I want to go to a bridge and jump off" refers to a current/future intention and plan. The "again" refers to the recurrence of the *thought* or *desire*, not necessarily a past *action* (attempt).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts ("ending my life"). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The post includes a specific plan: "I want to go to a bridge and jump off." This includes a specific method (jumping) and a specific location (a bridge).
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'Ideation' is for explicit suicidal thoughts *without* a specific plan. This post *has* a specific plan.
     - 'Behavior' is for explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan, method, or preparations, including suitable locations like bridges. This fits perfectly.
     - 'Attempt' is for describing *past concrete actions*. While "again" hints at past thoughts, it does not explicitly state a past *concrete action* (e.g., "I tried to overdose last week"). The primary focus is on the current suicidal ideation with a specific plan. If the post had clearly stated a past attempt (e.g., "After my last failed attempt, I'm thinking about a bridge"), then 'Attempt' would be chosen. However, "thinking about ending my life again" suggests recurring ideation, not necessarily a past concrete attempt. The most prominent and definitive element is the *current specific plan*.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

Post: Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal
True Label: behavior
Predicted Label: behavior
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: "kill myself" is a direct explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The plea "Help me" indicates distress and a serious intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: "find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal" explicitly mentions a specific method (lethal medication/drugs) and a clear step towards acquiring the means, which constitutes preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, "kill myself".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, "Help me kill myself."

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, "barbiturates/Nembutal".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the request to "help me find" them is a clear sign of actively seeking means, which is a form of preparation for a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions ("Help me kill myself", "help me find"). No past events are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because there is not just a desire to die, but also a specific method mentioned and a request for help in acquiring it, which constitutes a plan/preparation.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because it describes current intentions and planning, not a past action.
   - 'Behavior' fits perfectly as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts ("Help me kill myself") and mentions a specific plan/method ("find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal") and preparation (seeking to acquire them).

Post: I want to be gone tonight. I'm in so much mental pain, I want this pain to turn into physical. I want it to be over tonight, I don't wanna survive it. Please, I don't want it to continue, I can't handle it, I want it to stop. I hate everything, I need peace.
True Label: behavior
Predicted Label: ideation
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: "I want to be gone tonight," "I want it to be over tonight," "I don't wanna survive it," "I want it to stop," "I need peace." These phrases strongly imply a desire to end one's life or current existence. The phrase "I want this pain to turn into physical" indicates extreme distress and a potential desire for self-harm, but not a specific suicide method.
   - Emotional indicators: "so much mental pain," "I can't handle it," "I hate everything." These show severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., "I'm going to jump," "I'm taking pills") or preparations (e.g., "I wrote a note") are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word "suicide" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to end one's life: "I want to be gone tonight," "I want it to be over tonight," "I don't wanna survive it." These are explicit expressions of not wanting to be alive.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as noted above.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? "I want to be gone tonight," "I want it to be over tonight" clearly indicate current and immediate future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life/not be alive.
   - Fits 'Ideation' because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (desire to not be alive, wanting it to be over) but no specific plan.
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan or method mentioned.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it does not describe a past suicide attempt.

Post: i am not ok. not depressed, but if anyone know anything about Erik Erikson, i failed all the development stages that are needed for my age. i am severely codependent, i can't think for myself at all, i need people to do everything for me, i have no sense of self, constant anxiety, self doubt, and mistrust, i feel really small, like a child. this is very unhealthy. i don't know what to do. i can't look for therapy because it is very expensive, and like i mentioned before, i can't do anything myself. i plan to kill myself at 21, whether i want to or not, i'm 18 now. i can see this in everything i do, in everything i am. i can't even talk, and i don't know what else to say because my brain is so empty, people h e to say everything for me. i am so apathetic and passive towards everything, i have no creativity at all. every relationship i have with friends is a parent-child type thing. it's not fixable, there is no hope, i wish there was a reset button on time, but there isn't. i feel braindead. time passes, and it's only getting worse the older i become, and it's gonna be too late to do anything. i should have grown up normally, not start when i'm 18 or even older. i can't do this by myself. i am supposed to be independent by now. not to mention the constant loneliness, because no one wants to be with a person like this. i always need approval and attention, it sucks. i've become anhedonic and dissoative now. i can't be alone, but i'm always alone, so i spend all day everyday on my phone. this is hell.
True Label: behavior
Predicted Label: ideation
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: "i plan to kill myself at 21" is an explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: "i am not ok," "severely codependent," "constant anxiety, self doubt, and mistrust," "no hope," "this is hell," "anhedonic and dissoative." These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states "i plan to kill myself at 21." This is a temporal plan (a specific future age/time), but it does not specify a method (e.g., overdose, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, "i plan to kill myself".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, "i plan to kill myself".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations (e.g., suicide note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The "at 21" is a future intention/temporal plan, not a method or preparation as defined for 'behavior'.
   - The definition for 'behavior' requires "some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken." Since no method or preparation is specified, despite the temporal plan, it does not meet the strict criteria for 'behavior'. The rule "If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'" is relevant here as the plan is temporal but lacks method/preparation specificity.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes current feelings of distress and a future intention ("i plan to kill myself at 21").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no mention of past attempts.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because, while there is a stated intention/plan ("i plan to kill myself at 21"), it lacks the specific method or preparation details required by the 'behavior' definition (e.g., "lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons," "suitable locations"). The plan is temporal, not methodological or preparatory.
   - 'Ideation' fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive ("i plan to kill myself") but without the specific details of *how* (method/preparations) that would categorize it as 'behavior'. The "at 21" indicates a strong, fixed desire to end life, which aligns with strong ideation.

Post: It just really bothers me…and I don't really have the guts to do it. I'm on placement at the moment for work, and once these 6 months are over, I do not know what I'm going to do with my life. I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, "I feel like the only way out is suicide." It also mentions, "I've considered hanging," and "I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts."
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with expressions of hopelessness, despair, frustration, self-doubt, and overwhelm: "really bothers me," "don't know what I'm going to do," "hate," "struggle," "can't seem to do that," "cry very easily," "stuck in this rat race," "not smart enough," "memory is so shit," "no interest in doing anything," "feel so empty," "feel like things are just crushing," "getting harder and harder," "overwhelming," "really scared."
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method, "hanging," is mentioned. However, this is immediately qualified by "but I can't seem to go through with it" and "I don't have the guts." There are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, "I feel like the only way out is suicide."
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, "I feel like the only way out is suicide," and "I think I should just make my escape."

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, "hanging."
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, the mention of "hanging" is immediately followed by "but I can't seem to go through with it" and "I don't have the guts." This indicates a *consideration* of a method, but a clear lack of current intent or ability to execute a plan. The definition for 'behavior' requires "a plan to commit suicide." The post explicitly states the inability to go through with it, negating the presence of a concrete plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and intentions ("I feel like the only way out is suicide," "I've considered hanging").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. Suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past attempts are described.
    *   **Behavior:** While a method ("hanging") is mentioned, the crucial phrases "but I can't seem to go through with it" and "I don't have the guts" indicate a *lack* of a concrete plan or intent to act on that method. The definition for 'behavior' requires "a plan to commit suicide." The post describes ideation *about* a method, not a plan. The rule "If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'" applies here.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings ("I feel like the only way out is suicide," "I think I should just make my escape"). It also mentions a method ("hanging") but clearly states the inability to act on it, meaning there is no specific plan to commit suicide. This aligns perfectly with the 'ideation' definition: "The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."

Post: Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired.

Model Thinking: <thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly asks "Is there a painless way to die" and states "I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain." These are direct expressions of a desire to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** "I'm struggling," "unmotivated," "selfish," "The world scares me," "fear intimacy and feel worthless," "I'm tired." These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user is *asking* about a "painless way to die" and states "I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain." This indicates a search for a method, but not the mention of a specific method or any preparations being made.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** While the word "suicide" is not used, phrases like "painless way to die" and "how to die with certainty and without pain" are very explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life. Yes.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, "Is there a painless way to die," and "I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method is mentioned. The user is inquiring about methods, not stating one.

    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** There is no explicit plan, only a desire to find one.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current thoughts and future intentions (finding a way to die).
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die, not just general distress.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post repeatedly questions "whats the point of living", states "none of it will matter when you're dead", explicitly says "want to kill myself", "want to die", "constantly thinking about how nothing matters after you die and how life doesnt really matter", "still have this feeling that i should do it anyways", and asks "why shouldnt we just kill ourselves".

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are described. The mention of "for a year straight i was constantly thinking" refers to past *thoughts*, not past *actions* or attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times ("want to kill myself", "should do it anyways", "why shouldnt we just kill ourselves").

It refers to past prolonged thoughts ("for a year straight i was constantly thinking") but the core of the post is about current feelings and rhetorical questions regarding future actions ("i still want to die", "i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways", "why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"). There are no descriptions of past *attempts*.

Post: I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon
True Label: ideation
Predicted Label: indicator
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: "I'm going to die soon" - a statement about impending death.
    *   Emotional indicators: "I'm inconsolable" - indicates extreme distress, hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word "suicide" or "kill myself" or "end my life" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase "I'm going to die soon" expresses an expectation or belief of impending death, which, combined with "inconsolable," strongly implies a desire to not be alive. However, the rules state: "Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'." and "When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'." The phrase "I'm going to die soon" is a statement about dying, not explicitly about *suicide* or *self-inflicted* death. It could be interpreted as a passive statement of hopelessness leading to death, rather than an active desire to cause death. Given the strictness required for 'Ideation' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings) and the "when in doubt" rule, this leans towards 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention ("I'm going to die soon").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress ("inconsolable") and a statement about impending death ("I'm going to die soon").
    *   However, it does not explicitly use the word "suicide" or a direct equivalent like "kill myself" or "end my life."
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' explicitly states: "The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'." and "When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."
    *   While concerning, "I'm going to die soon" is a statement about dying, not an explicit statement of suicidal intent or a desire to *cause* death, as strictly defined for 'Ideation'. Therefore, it falls under 'Indicator' due to the lack of explicit suicidal phrasing.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of "suicide," "dying," or "self-harm."
    *   Emotional indicators: "I hate living," "sometime i think about why i have to live" indicate strong distress, hopelessness, and existential despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? "I hate living" expresses a strong desire *not* to live, but it does not explicitly state "I want to die" or "I want to kill myself." The 'Indicator' definition states: "Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'." Given this strict rule, "I hate living" falls under "very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness" rather than an explicit suicidal thought.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings and ongoing thoughts ("I hate living," "sometime i think"). No past attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound dissatisfaction with life and a questioning of existence ("I hate living," "why i have to live until now").
    *   However, it lacks any explicit mention of "suicide," "killing myself," or a direct desire to die. The instructions for 'Indicator' are very strict: "The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."
    *   While "I hate living" conveys a strong negative sentiment about existence, it does not cross the threshold of explicit suicidal ideation as defined, especially with the instruction to lean towards 'indicator' when in doubt about explicitness.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word "suicide" is not used, but "end it" is a very explicit and direct expression of wanting to end one's life in this context.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, "Now it's time to end it."

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *current* methods are mentioned for the current intention.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned for the current intention.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to both past events ("So I tried. And I tried again...") and current/future intentions ("Now it's time to end it.").
   - Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and past attempts.
   - 'Ideation' describes explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. The post *does* have current ideation ("Now it's time to end it").
   - 'Behavior' requires an explicit plan or self-harming behavior *currently*. While there's current ideation, there's no specific plan detailed for it.
   - 'Attempt' describes past attempts. The post clearly states "So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more." This fits the definition of past attempts. The definition for 'Attempt' also includes a crucial note: "Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'." The phrase "Now it's time to end it" can be interpreted as a current intention or "plan" in the broader sense, especially when combined with the explicit past attempts. Therefore, the presence of both past attempts and current suicidal ideation/intention places it firmly in the 'Attempt' category according to the specific rule provided.

Post: When I encounter new people, in person or online. I always think to myself "when will they leave?". Such a fucked up way to feel about a person I barely even know but in my experience no one sticks around. everyone leaves you eventually. Especially the ones who promised they would stay. I start reflecting thinking hmm maybe it's me?. But then I realize I push people away unintentionally because I already have the mind frame of they will leave so it's more like "let's get this over with". and the ones who are reluctant to stay I don't necessarily give them a reason to. so shucks, I'd leave too. I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.
True Label: indicator
Predicted Label: indicator
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of "suicide," "death," or "dying." The phrase "I'd leave myself if I could" is metaphorical, expressing a desire to escape one's own painful patterns/feelings, not a direct wish for death or self-harm.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): "fucked up way to feel," "no one sticks around," "everyone leaves you eventually," "it still hurts." These indicate deep emotional pain, loneliness, feelings of abandonment, and self-blame.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase "I'd leave myself if I could" is metaphorical for wanting to escape one's current state or self, not a direct desire for non-existence.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The post expresses significant distress but does not explicitly mention suicide or a direct desire to die. Therefore, it leans towards 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and ongoing patterns in relationships ("I always think," "I push people away"). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses emotional distress, loneliness, and self-blame. However, it *lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide*. There is no direct mention of wanting to die, ending one's life, or suicidal thoughts. The definition of 'indicator' states: "The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'." This post fits that description perfectly.

Predicted Label: indicator
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: "sick of," "tired of," "ugly and horrible," "hate everything about myself," "disgusting." These indicate severe distress, self-loathing, and hopelessness regarding appearance.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The desire is "to be someone else," not to end life.
   - References to past attempts: None. The past actions described (dying hair, makeup, new clothes, eating habits) are attempts to change appearance, not self-harm or suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase "i just wish i could press a button and be someone else" expresses a desire for radical change or escape from current self, but not explicitly a desire to die or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and ongoing struggles ("im sick of," "i'm tired of," "i feel," "i hate"). It mentions past actions taken to change appearance, but these are not related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses profound distress, self-hatred, and a desire to escape one's current self ("I just want to be someone else"). However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. According to the definitions, "Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'." Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and there's no direct desire to die, it falls under 'indicator'.

True Label: indicator
Predicted Label: ideation
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: "my brain keeps telling me to kill myself" (explicit mention of suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: "so tiring", "tired and lonely", "mind is against you". These indicate significant distress, mental fatigue, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post explicitly states "but I don't actually want to."
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, "my brain keeps telling me to kill myself".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The *thought* of wanting to die/kill oneself is explicitly mentioned as something the brain is telling the person, even if the person states they don't *actually* want to. This still constitutes an explicit suicidal thought.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no uncertainty; no plan is mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current ongoing thoughts ("keeps telling me", "I just feel"). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned ("kill myself").
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The post explicitly states the person doesn't *want* to.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits best. The post contains "explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings" ("my brain keeps telling me to kill myself"), but "without any specific plan to commit suicide." The internal struggle with these thoughts aligns with ideation.

I'm deteriorating. I just want to get it over with. I'm not alone, but I can't tell anyone either. I refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will. The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last.
True Label: indicator
Predicted Label: ideation
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrases "I just want to get it over with" and "The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last" strongly imply a desire to end life and a consideration of the act itself, with pain being the deterrent. While the word "suicide" isn't used, the context clearly points to ending one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** "It's not working anymore," "I'm deteriorating," "I haven't slept in weeks," "all I see and think are people are going to hurt me," "refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will." These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, paranoia, and a feeling of being trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. No tools, locations, or specific actions are described.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word "suicide" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. "I just want to get it over with" in this context signifies a desire to end life. "The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it" directly refers to the act of ending one's life, indicating a desire to do so, with pain being the only deterrent. This goes beyond vague distress and clearly indicates a desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan is mentioned, it's not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions ("I just want to get it over with," "if I go through with it").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to end life ("get it over with," "go through with it" with fear of pain from the act itself), fitting the definition of 'Ideation' ("explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer").
    *   It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death, explicitly indicating a desire to end life, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

Model Thinking: <thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: "Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?" - This is a direct expression related to dying.
   - Emotional indicators: "Life's not about being yourself... stripping yourself of individuality", "depressed 16 year old", "People love plastic, and people love plastic people." - Indicates hopelessness, despair, feeling misunderstood and unaccepted.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase "how about i die then" is a direct, albeit rhetorical, expression of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, "how about i die then".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention ("how about i die then").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die ("how about i die then").
   - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - It does not describe a past suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan.

    *   Past actions: "the past two times ive tried ive failed." This clearly describes concrete past suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts ("Ideation" criteria).
    *   Crucially, it also describes *past attempts*: "the past two times ive tried ive failed."
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: "The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'." While there isn't a *current plan*, there is strong current *ideation* ("I want to be brave enough to kill myself") alongside the clear description of past attempts. The primary driver for this classification is the explicit mention and description of "past attempts". The rule explicitly covers scenarios where past attempts are mentioned, even if current elements are also present.

Post: The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.

True Label: attempt
Predicted Label: behavior
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: "Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself", "I'm ready to be done", "I'm so close to just doing it", "I just need someone to push me one more inch." The post also describes a specific action: "I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying." This is a clear description of an initiated self-harming act with suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: "All failing", "Liver hurt every day", "wife told me today, again, that she wants a divorce", "ruin my life over it", "so stressed out over everything", "business is just about to fail", "fucking everything up now", "started crying." These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, "put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet". This describes a specific method (strangulation/hanging) and a specific setup/location.
   - References to past attempts: The described action ("put a belt around my neck... Right before I passed out, I stopped") is an initiated act that was interrupted, not a completed past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes ("kill myself", "ready to be done", "so close to just doing it").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes ("ready to be done", "Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, "put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob". This is a concrete method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of putting the belt around the neck and positioning oneself is a clear sign of preparation and initiation of the act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event ("tonight") where a suicidal act was initiated but interrupted. Crucially, it also expresses strong current and future intent ("I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch.").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a specific action was taken.
   - 'Ideation' is incorrect because a specific method and action were described and initiated, going beyond mere thoughts or feelings.
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect because the action was explicitly stated as being stopped *before* completion ("Right before I passed out, I stopped"). An attempt implies a completed action that failed or was interrupted by external factors, or resulted in injury. This was an initiated, self-interrupted act.
   - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts ("I'm so close to just doing it") and describes a self-harming behavior/initiated plan ("I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped"). This clearly meets the definition of 'behavior' which covers explicit thoughts combined with a plan or self-harming behavior/preparations, even if interrupted.

Post: How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.
True Label: attempt
Predicted Label: behavior
Model Thinking: <thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, "I tried to cut myself last night." This is a direct mention of self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** "during a breakdown," "very bad night," and "wanted to feel something real" indicate significant emotional distress and a coping mechanism for it.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A method ("cut myself") is mentioned, and it refers to a past action. No current plans or preparations are indicated.
    *   **References to past attempts:** "I tried to cut myself last night" directly describes a past action. "I've never done it or wanted to do it before" reinforces that this was a new, past event.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post describes self-harm, but doesn't explicitly state an intention to die or commit suicide. The stated motivation was "wanted to feel something real."
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, "cut myself." This method was *tried* in the past.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not for a *current* plan. The action was already taken.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? "last night" clearly indicates a past event.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is too mild as a concrete act of self-harm is described.
    *   **Ideation:** This category refers to thoughts/feelings without a specific plan or action. An action ("tried to cut myself") occurred, so this is not appropriate.
    *   **Attempt:** This category is for "past attempts at suicide." While a concrete action ("tried to cut myself") happened in the past, the post explicitly states the motivation was "wanted to feel something real," not explicitly to die. This suggests non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) rather than a direct suicide attempt. If the intent was not suicide, this category is not the best fit.
    *   **Behavior:** This category states, "The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior." The post *does* describe "self-harming behavior" ("tried to cut myself"). While the action occurred in the past, the post *exhibits* or describes this behavior. Given that the intent was not explicitly suicidal (as per the "wanted to feel something real" statement), and 'Attempt' is specifically for *suicide* attempts, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category for describing a past act of self-harm where suicidal intent is not explicitly stated as the primary goal. The definition of 'Behavior' does not strictly limit "exhibits self-harming behavior" to only *current* acts.

Considering the nuance between self-harm and suicide attempts, and the stated motivation, 'Behavior' best captures the described action without assuming explicit suicidal intent for the past action.
