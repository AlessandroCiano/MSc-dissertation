542,"First time I ever consider suicide Sorry for the long post.       I never considered suicide until last year, but I don't think I can go on much longer.        I'm from Lebanon, a small country in the Middle East. You may have heard about it in the news. This country that had an extraordinarily rich culture, perfect geography, and infinite potential, has turned to a literal hell hole in the span of a year and a half. And the worst is yet to come.           In 2019 I was 22, freshly graduated, and had my first job. I had moved out and started living independently, life was fucking great but I didn't realize it back then. I'll spare you the political and economical details unless someone is interested, but in October everything started turning to shit. The effects of decades of widespread corruption and sectarian division started to show, and the economy started going downhill.        I lost my job in January of 2020, along with a huge chunk of the population. I had to start financially relying on my parents again, which already took away what I enjoyed the most in my life: the fact I was finally a self-sufficient, responsible person. Then covid hit. And then on August 4th 2020, what some of you may know Lebanon for, happened.       The third biggest non-nuclear explosion in the history of mankind happened in the heart of Beirut, the capital. It created a shockwave that was felt all the way to Cyprus, a fucking ISLAND 200 kilometers away from Lebanon. Why? Because the government was so corrupt and negligent that thousands of tons of explosive chemicals were dangerously stored in a warehouse and caught fire.      Thankfully my family and I lived far enough from the explosion to suffer nothing but shattered windows, but I was a few hundred meters away from the blast when it happened. You can find footage of the explosion online, so I don't think I have to go in detail as to what happened. I knew my family were home so I didn't worry about them, but my grandpa lived even closer to the blast than I was, and phones were unusable. I started running towards his home, as I anticipated seeing him crushed by rubble.      The thought of describing what I saw that day, running through the city where I made my strongest friendships, found love, studied, graduated, and got into the professional world, already has me shaking and crying.     Entire houses and buildings I knew had turned into rubble. The road was a sea of glass, stone, and cement. Sirens, people shouting, screaming, crying, everywhere. I don't even want to think about how many dead people I ran by. I don't think anyone can even make a movie like this. I think I'm gonna stop talking about this.     Thankfully my grandpa only suffered minor injuries. I'm glad I wasn't the one to take him to the hospital because I don't think I could have taken it. I've heard stories and seen videos of destroyed hospitals, that were already crowded with covid cases, walls and floors covered in blood and doctors performing surgeries on the floor.       This was the last straw for Lebanon. In 2019, 1$ was equivalent to 1500 Lebanese pounds. Today, it's 13800, and increasing by the day. Medicine, fuel, electricity, and food are becoming less and less accessible. People are fighting in supermarkets over bread or milk for their kids. Lebanon is the poorest, hungriest, and most politically unstable it has ever been. Robberies and violence are becoming routine. We're headed to a collapse that will be remembered in history books as a case study of how corrupt, evil, greedy, and hateful humans can get.     And then there's me. I've spent the last few months alone in my appartment because of lockdowns and the financial crisis, with no job, no foreign passport or any other way to get out of this hell hole, and nothing to do except watching netflix or playing video games when the electricity and internet connection allow it. I roll a joint the second I wake up because I don't think I can face this life sober for a single hour.       Millions of people around the world go through poverty, traumas and wars, but what kills me from the inside is remembering the life I had, and could have had. I was a regular kid from a regular family, had friends, went to school, and was about to live a normal life. Now I understand how valuable this is. Many of my friends managed to leave or had already left to study abroad before the crisis. The others I barely see anymore. I can't imagine what my parents are going through, raising me for all these years just for me to have my life taken away from me like that.  I have no one to open up to, which is why I'm writing on a new account.       Now I can't do anything other than being a spectator of my own existence and watch hell break loose from my window, holding on to the memory of the two decades of ""normal life"" I had. I guess I'll just continue to exist until I find the courage to get this over with, or until some other mega bomb goes off next to my home.       I beg you to enjoy every friend, family member, pet, every meal in a restaurant, every roadtrip, every party,  every exam, hour spent at work, every laughter, every argument, every fight, every kiss, and every drink as if they were the last you will ever have, because they might very well be.",ideation

He started panicking. I panicked too. I didnt really give a shit wether or not i had rabies because im going to kill myself soon but i REALLY didn‚Äôt want him to get rabies.

I think things got worse with the political climate. Not that I'm on either side but when I see people fighting and arguing it just makes me feel like killing myself. I wish I could go to school but I feel like it's too late for me. I have a girlfriend too which made it harder to actually go through with it. I also reconnected with my brother which also made it harder to do it. It's really hard. It usually makes me feel better to say something but I always feel like I'm bothering them or some people will try to make me feel better but it would just make me feel worse. It makes me feel like they don't really understand or listened to what I had to say. People will tell me something bad in their past and say ""I get sad too"" but for me it's more than that. I just always feel like this. Sometimes it helps to go on Twitter and tell people I want to kill myself. But mostly on the people with the blue checkmarks. I know they won't reply or care. This is the first time posting something like this in the 'new age internet' when message boards and chat rooms were a thing I would always talk about it there.

I'm from Aus, so there is alot of mental health support and I've seen multiple people. I'm about to see another phsyciatrist in a couple days to more properly diagnose what I'm going through and hopefully get me on the right medication. Now, what I'm trying to get to is, I'm not bothered anymore. I'm not bothered seeing anyone anymore, I'm not bothered trying to distract myself anymore, I'm not bothered trying to get better anymore. I have been going through depression for the last 5 years or so (I know it isn't long, but for me it's felt like my whole life). I feel like I'm ready to go, I feel like I'm not scared of death, if anything I feel like I embrace it. I want to end this pain that I go through every single day, but I can't. I can't bear to think that my two daughters will grow up without a dad, I can't bear to think that my partner won't have anyone to help with the kids, I can't bear to think that my widowed mum will be by herself. But it pisses me off soo much that I can't leave this terrible place because of them. I'm stuck here. I'm stuck living a life that I don't want to live. I just want to know what to do!! Everyone says just keep trying, it will get better, but it doesn't. And if it will, I can't wait anymore. I cant deal with this anymore. But I have to do.

I was devastated but what could I do. Since the last 2 weeks i lost 14pounds. That same day she went to his house they got drunk and I found out instantly through her brother. I didnt tell her i knew, because when she got home she messaged me how much she loves me but love isnt everything, but then admitted she was with him but told me they only kissed etc... We met the next day and she told me she loved me and will never love anyone like me but cant be together with me coz she still cant go through the thing I had more girls and she had only me.. We were always the kind of be together forever couple. She told me that we can still be friends but cant be together coz she doesnt want to hurt me ever. She hasnt met the guy since then, so I decided to meet her again myself and talk to her. She always told me she would never give a BJ to any other guy without relationship, because she knows it would TOTALLY break my heart and my whole life (i knew that one day it would happen, but still) she told me she would never ever do it immediately, but she confessed to me, that she did suck His dick the same day I was very ill and she broke up with me, but she totally disliked it.

681,I feel like my wife hates me 27 NB (AMAB)  I love this woman with every fiber of my being. I'd do anything for her. Literally anything. But lately I've been extremely depressed and I feel like its such a bother for her to really be there for me. Its sending me spiralling hard. I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to.   She's my best friend but I feel like when I tell her how I'm feeling she thinks less of me. She hasn't wanted to spend time with me for a week and its leaving me feeling so isolated. I feel so alone with my already insane depression. It seems like a chore for her to tell me she loves me or she misses me. Its making me feel worthless. Unworthy of her love. Like I'm weak. Not man enough for her.   I want to scream. I want to feel something other than this. I want to be happy. I want to feel like I'm deserving of her love. Comfort. Understanding. As time goes on my mind has been periodically wandering to a really dark place. I think about the gun by my bed. I just keep thinking that I don't want to hurt anymore. I want it to end.   I want to know somebody's listening to me and won't dismiss me. Won't tell me I'm just trying to make them feel bad.   For context I'm a US Navy sub vet who saw and experienced abuse as a child and teenager against myself and one of my sisters. These are where a lot of my depression comes from. PTSD.,behavior

Back then I was mostly just indifferent to the way I looked, like I didn‚Äôt hate my appearance but I definitely didn‚Äôt love it. I do remember hating all my school pictures, and whenever I had to see my most recent one I‚Äôd look away because I disliked looking at myself. This was back when I was in about third grade I think.  Looking back, I don‚Äôt think I was pretty as a kid despite when people say. My family thinks I was a gorgeous baby and kid, but I really don‚Äôt see it. When I was in fifth grade there was a slideshow of all the kids in the grades‚Äô baby, kindgarten and current pictures at elementary school graduation, and I remember wincing when mine can up. I was ashamed that everyone had to see me as an ugly little kid.  As I‚Äôm writing this I realize how awful it sounds. Maybe there‚Äôs just no such thing as a good picture of me, but either way I‚Äôm not made for photos. Even when I was little I wasn‚Äôt.  I really don‚Äôt know how other people can look at themselves in the mirror and not hate what they see. I‚Äôm happy they all don‚Äôt have to go through what I do. Saying this makes me feel incredibly awful, because I‚Äôm not covered in scars (on my face or other easily visible body parts at least) and don‚Äôt have any disfigurements or anything. I just hate my skin, my face, my everything.  Everyday when I wake up and look in the mirror I can‚Äôt help but think about how unattractive I am. I constantly think about how no one would ever want me and how I‚Äôll never date anyone for several reasons, one of them being how much I dislike myself and my appearance. I think I‚Äôd be unfair to a potential boyfriend to have to date someone who hates themselves as much as I do, and that‚Äôs assuming someone would actually like me.  Two boys have liked me in the past, one in ninth grade and one a few weeks ago at a psych hospital. The one from ninth grade told me he liked me but not just because I was pretty, but for other reasons I forgot about. He was overall scary and extremely manipulative, so I took that with a grain of salt. The psych hospital guy was really nice and when I mentioned how unattractive I thought I was, he said that all the boys in the room would disagree. He ended up being manipulative as well and was scary too, and I‚Äôm never seeing him again anyways so I disregarded that statement.  I just don‚Äôt believe it when people call me pretty. I know that when you like a person they look more attractive to you and when you dislike someone they look uglier to you, so when my friends say how pretty I am I just remember that and think that must be the reason. Or they‚Äôre just being nice.  I know I‚Äôll never date anyone for a lot of reasons, like because I‚Äôm scared of boys/men, hate myself and how I look, have trauma, and am asexual and afraid of sex in general.

756,"Kinda amazed I'm still around honestly. I'm 27, going to turn 28 in a few months. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. When I was in elementary school I used to constantly wish I had never been born. I was convinced I'd kill myself by the time I was 16. Obviously, that didn't happen.  I've had ups and downs in my life, I had a period of maybe two years in college where I actually genuinely felt GOOD about my life and where it was headed. Then my depression and anxiety got worse again. Spent a week in a behavioral hospital. Got on meds. They took the edge off but I never got back to that positive space. I wasn't miserable though, so they did their job.  Fast forward to last year, my dad killed himself in February. It came out of nowhere. Not gonna get deep into it, but we never had a great relationship until we reconnected around 2018. It pretty much wrecked me. I'm still not ""over it."" I can't even handle thinking about him.  Literally the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my mom. She has no other family and it would destroy her if I died, especially in that way. I will not do that to her. But, as it stands right now, I'm going to kill myself when she's gone. I've never admitted that to anyone but I need to get it off my chest.  I keep hoping that something will happen to make me want to stick around. That I'll find passion for something, get a good job, maybe a partner. You know, the usual things. But it's hard to even muster up the energy to do simple things like get out of bed and shower. It's also just. . . hard to plan for the future when you've spent your whole life thinking, ""I'm going to kill myself one day.""  Honestly I'm kinda just posting this to get it off my chest. I don't really delve too deeply into how shitty I feel with my mom or my friends because I don't want to burden them.

If I killed myself, I think I'd be helping my family in the long run. One less mouth to feed, one less child to worry about. My parents spend so much time paying attention to me and my mental health that I'm worried my siblings aren't being given the attention they need. if I die, maybe everyone can finally be happy.

781,"(TW) Suicide is sometimes rational, and I'm trying to honestly figure out if that's where I'm at I'm 22, I've been homeless and fleeing domestic violence for most of my adult life with severe chronic PTSD, eating disorders that I'm statistically pretty likely to die from before 30 and depressive-psychotic episodes which often come at the worst times and put me in increased danger or can cause me to (accidentally) hurt anyone who cared enough to stick around. I wake up most days at 4 am re-experiencing rape, and my day usually gets worse from there on out. I've tried EVERY treatment I could access, from years of hospitalizations (10+, mostly voluntary and ALL of them made it much worse) and way more medication than any person should take, to off the books treatments and therapists, psycho-analysis, massage, acupuncture and Chinese herbs, other herbs, self-medicating with fun herbs, seeing dieticians and nutritionists and holistic life couches, DBT, CBT, ACT, EMDR, all kinds of groups and programs, live-in programs, eating disorder residentials, endless outpatient clinics, case management, peer support, even psychedelic therapy, getting an emotional support animal, skydiving, learning to play the harp, traveling the continent multiple times and trying to create my own hospital alternatives.  I've literally done everything I have the power to do to try and recover inside and outside of the system, and most of these things haven't made a considerable difference or have actually made it actively worse (meds lol). No matter the case, I don't have the resources to keep trying and I just don't have the energy anymore either.    My life ending early is likely to be unavoidable anyway, and continuing to live this miserably when I know it's likely for nothing (that I'll never get to recover, feel lasting happiness or maintain healthy relationships), feels cruel to me, especially when I can't stay alive without re-experiencing severe trauma near-daily and putting myself at real risk to repeat that trauma regularly. I've come to think of myself as someone who might be granted ethical assisted suicide if that existed in this country for mental health concerns, despite my age.      So, I'm here writing this mostly, simply, because I don't have any person in my life I can tell this to (except, actually, my mom, who agrees with me and supports my decision to end my life). But I want to know if other people agree this is reasonable or not. It wouldn't necessarily change my mind, but I am trying to do the most rational thing and at this moment my mind is still kind of open.

852,"Chronically ill. Suicidal. Sorry this is kind of long. I just have a lot to say and nobody in real life will listen.   I‚Äôm chronically ill with, what my doctors call, a severe case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. All of my joints dislocate on a daily basis, sitting too long will cause fabrics to rip into my skin, standing up makes me blackout instantly and I hit my head regularly because of this, I can no longer walk and use a wheelchair to get around, I have a problem with literally all of my organs from this, and I‚Äôm constantly in pain. There is no cure for this shitty disease I was born with. As of this year, I can‚Äôt drive anymore without vomiting or falling asleep.   Since it‚Äôs gotten worse this past year, I‚Äôve been struggling in school. Since I have accommodations through my university‚Äôs Accessibility Resources, I have excused medical absences and no late penalty for assignments. However, all of my professors tell me to drop out since I haven‚Äôt been able to attend the last two weeks. Even before I got worse recently, they always keep trying to ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with me‚Äù and I‚Äôm not comfortable sharing that with them and it‚Äôs incredibly awkward. Additionally, they‚Äôd always call me out in class and say shit like ‚ÄúI know this makes you uncomfortable, [name],‚Äù or ‚ÄúWould this work for you? I know you can‚Äôt walk.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre actually trying to be helpful but they make me feel singled out in front of 30+ people. One professor even keeps trying to meet me outside of class to talk about my ‚Äúmedical issues.‚Äù Accessibility Resources is in the midst of dealing with all of those problems, since I can‚Äôt deal with this anymore myself but it‚Äôs going nowhere.   I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Major Depressive disorder with psychotic features. Another doctor says I‚Äôm probably autistic on top of that but I can‚Äôt afford testing, since my insurance generally only covers 1% for procedures. They covered $17 of my brother‚Äôs $15k sleep study. I see psychiatrists, therapists, rheumatologist, occupational and physical therapists, cardiologists, gastroenterologist, a connective tissue clinic, and neurologists. I‚Äôve been seeing these people, from three different hospitals, for years now. I‚Äôm just not getting better.   I‚Äôm going to have to drop out of college since I can‚Äôt get to my classes or do any of the work. I have to quit my job because I can‚Äôt get to work. However, this job is waiting to fully hire me (with benefits and better health insurance) when I get my degree, since I‚Äôm two semesters away from graduating. But I‚Äôm throwing that all away since I literally can‚Äôt leave my bed.   I‚Äôve always been suicidal since I was ten and was constantly in and out of psych inpatient units. Since 2010, I‚Äôve tried to kill myself 20 times. The last time I was in an inpatient unit (last year), one of the male nurses pressed his erection into my back, and I can barely go into hospitals anymore because I‚Äôm just terrified of male doctors and nurses now.   I‚Äôm on ten different medications for a myriad of reasons and none work as intended.   I don‚Äôt have any friends, at work or from school, so I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to or get help from. I lost all of my friends within the last year because they‚Äôre ‚Äútired of being friends with someone as disabled as [me].‚Äù   Last time I called 911 for assistance, they tried to put me in an inpatient unit, but chose not to after explaining what happened last time and that I‚Äôm actively seeing doctors on a weekly basis.   I‚Äôm at a loss and feel permanently stuck.   When I drop out, I‚Äôll lose all of my scholarships and grants and won‚Äôt be able to even do part time. So college is pretty much over for me, even though it was my favorite thing to do.   I don‚Äôt plan on living much longer. I‚Äôm done. I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. I‚Äôm so emotionally, physically, and academically exhausted. I‚Äôm truly not meant to live normally in this world and I‚Äôm tired of trying. I haven‚Äôt left my bed in days and don‚Äôt have energy to eat or drink.   Thanks for reading this, if you did.

I avoid it because people are always trying to fix you and give you advice and that's part of the reason I'm angry in the first place.

I'm 27 never had a job because my anxiety and me feeling clueless about how the world works has held me back. My mom had a heart attack april 2020, she constantly bitches at me about how useless I am, and brought me down so much that I have 0 confidence. I then started talking to a toxic person online and that didn't help either. I just didn't want to be alone. They changed the way my whole brain thinks. I was manipulated and allowed it because I just didn't want to be alone plus it made me feel less crazy and weird talking to someone that was like that. It's hard to explain I guess I stopped loving myself so I just stayed. Well I stopped taking care of myself in like 2014. I havent been to a doctor since 2010. I have a hard time taking care of myself. I don't even know how to make appointments for myself. I hate company when they come over now and can't stand being around people. I have panic attacks. At 27 I should have my life partially figured out but I don't. The only accomplishment I have was from 2013. I watch my siblings all stepping ahead in life. My parents are divorced, we live with my brother. I feel like I don't belong here because my mom says if it weren't for them I'd be homeless and no one would take me in if it wasn't for them. I don't feel good about myself. I don't even feel attractive anymore. My mom always worries me, yells at me, puts me down,  says she's going to die soon within 8 years.  I feel like shit because I don't want that to happen and feel like if she does I'll be at fault, I want to kill myself because of her. She says I add nothing but stress to her life, and pretty much begs me to get out there and as stupid as it sounds I can't and won't. I am not normal, so please don't judge me. I don't need to hear that because I know. I just want to know if anyone else in my situation so I don't feel alone. At the same time. I wasn't always like this. I used to go out. Didn't suffer anxiety as bad and didn't have agoraphobia, or scared of company, but my family put me down a lot and bullied, made me feel unloved  in the past, it still happens today. but they don't see any issue in their behavior. My mom gaslit me a lot whenever I open up about how I feel.  I get intrusive thoughts where I feel like killing myself is best option because I won't suffer anymore and I won't be a burden to others. I don't want to live in regret and I feel like my mom did enough damage to me, when she dies it will be my fault and I know it's going to be in my head that I could have tried harder for her but didn't. I have a lot more problems I haven't listed because I just don't know what to say or how to say it, but as of right now I feel like killing myself, like I feel like a lost puppy in this world. I would do anything to feel at least happy again and not burden anyone.",ideation

Take a good, long look at your life. At life itself. Match up how you fit into all of it, and seriously do a lot of reflection and conclusive analysis on your life. Take a truthful look at your life and be brutally honest with yourself about whether or not it's something that is working for you. Is it worth it to continue living? Have you done everything you could to try and create the type of life you want? What is the likelihood of your life changing for the better? What is the likelihood of life, itself, changing for the better? Really sit and ponder things like that. I'm amazed at the clarity that comes from doing this. So, please think deeply about it.

I was so exhausted after. I went to sleep feeling awful and woke up the same. I went to get groceries with my friend and the entire time I was at the verge of falling apart. It feels like I go into fight or flight mode but according to my friend I looked half asleep. He just kept saying how weird I was acting and I couldn't help it. It was always something. The way I was looking around. They way I wasn't saying anything. He explained it as there being nothing to grab onto when talking to me. It was horrible. Words cant describe what it feels like.

943,"I hate my ugly face, body and mind. I don't want to be me anymore... # I have never been happy. Not once in my entire life really. I wake up every morning and when I look in the mirror I want to throw up. When I see a picture of me its even worse. I hate my face, I hate my body and my mind. And semi-recently I started dating this woman, the most gorgeous thing on the planet to me and I began to start to feel a bit happier, and then it strikes again. I feel like I am to ugly for her, my personality isn't good enough for her. Every single time I look at her I want to smile and be happy, she's so perfect. Then I cringe and wanna hide my face because I am ugly, I even say to her that I am ugly and I can't have her look at me. Then she says I'm the most handsome man in the world to her. I don't get what she sees, I feel like this mangled thing. My entire life I've been told I was ugly. I've been told to off myself more times than I can count. And been told I am unlovable. Every relationship I've ever been in has ended because on top of this face, I can't be happy. So all I feel is sadness and anger. Any time I begin to feel happy I take a look at myself passing by a reflective surface and I want to cry. I see almost anyone out in public and think about how much more attractive they are than me and don't want to leave the house, especially with her. Nothing I do anymore is fun, the things I used to enjoy I have zero interest in. On top of this my entire life is trashed, I had to move in with my grandmother because months ago my ex left me and I couldn't keep up with the bills, I lost my job, I'm stuck in court with 2 different baby mamas trying to see my sons. My body is covered in acne that I can't seem to get rid of. Last night someone random called me ugly and I went outside and sat in my car, girlfriend and mother trying to talk to me and I just drove off. I sat there with a weapon in my hand debating on whether to just turn the lights out upstairs and call it a day. I've been in that mindset so many times you can't even imagine.

This isn‚Äôt a cry for help, if all you‚Äôre going to do is tell me not to, please save your breath for someone else.     Let me preface this by saying I have battled depression from a very young age, around 8 I suffered many losses of friends and family. I just turned 24 so its been 16 years and, I have fought and fought for a very long time. Even as a small child my parents told me that I would say things like ‚ÄúI want to go home to my real family.‚Äù and ‚ÄúThat I didn‚Äôt belong here‚Äù This would freak them and other out as a 4-5 year old would talk about being tired of life already and wanting to see his real family. I have lived my entire life homesick. Im tired. Not the kind of exhaustion I once felt where I just wanted to sleep, but one that I feel in my very being. Sleep was once a respite but now it‚Äôs just as bad if not worse than being awake. It use to come in waves but for the past few years it‚Äôs been ever constant, I don‚Äôt even have a moment to catch my breath. Just being wears me out anymore, I find no joy in anything, hell I barely feel anything anymore, almost everything that once brought me joy feels like a chore. Writing is one of my last few joys in this world so here I am writing. I have done many things to try to combat the depression and suicidal thoughts. Ive gone to therapy, tried different medications, psychadelics, meditation, dropping everything and moving away to start over, changing professions, going back to school, surrounding myself with happier people, etc, etc. Im currently on my last leg, I‚Äôm trying some more natural remedies, more natural suppliments, helping others again as that always seemed to at least ease my suffering even if only by a small amount. Ive tried to adhere to the buddhist teachings that if I ease the suffering of others I will ease my own.       The intent of this isn‚Äôt to be a suicide note, but if you find this and I have in-fact killed myself at this point, I hope this might provide some insight into why. Im writing this for myself not for anyone else, I‚Äôm hoping writing it out will let me work through some of my issues. I have never once in my life felt like I belong, when I‚Äôm surrounded by friends and loved ones I feel the most alone. I feel as though I‚Äôm little more than an imposter and that they either don‚Äôt like me and are faking it, or that they don‚Äôt even really know me and care about little more than a facade. Logically I know that there are people who at the very least SEEM to love me. Family and friends tell me they‚Äôd miss me, but in all honesty I am hitting the point where I no longer care. They tell me I‚Äôm being selfish, but aren‚Äôt they being selfish by trying to make me stay here and suffer. When I‚Äôve done psychadelics such as DMT I swear on everything that I‚Äôve seen my real family, and that I know they‚Äôre waiting for me. It‚Äôs not that they want me to kill myself, they want to see me live a good life, the want me to succeed and be happy. But I truly believe I have seen what Is waiting for us on the other side and it is so much more beautiful than anything you could imagine. The only time I‚Äôve ever felt true unconditional love was with them.     I feel like little more than a burden to those around me. I had to move back in with my parents recently thank to losing my job and covid. And I feel like I‚Äôm just a little bitch who can‚Äôt even stand on his own right now.       I have several mental illnesses; depression, anxiety, ADHD, OCD, and these all make doing things more and more difficult to do. I know there are people out there that cope with these and to those I‚Äôm SO proud of you. Ive tried a multitude of treatments, every single one has let me feel better for a couple of weeks and then my symptoms get worse. Im more apathetic and nihilistic than I‚Äôve ever been in my enter life. I used to exercise very day, and this helped, but after an accident in which I broke both my legs, I‚Äôve been unable to even get started back. I can‚Äôt even motivate myself to go out for a fucking walk. Honestly it feels like the only thing that has kept me from shooting myself Is the fact id have to go into another room unlock my safe and drive off to shoot myself so that my parents won‚Äôt find my corpse in their house. Im literally to unmotivated to even kill myself right now.  Even in rare moments of bliss I always think, man i should just end it on a high note.  I don‚Äôt want to sit here and play the victim, and I‚Äôm sorry if this comes off like I‚Äôm throwing myself a pity party. I just need to vent and get this out, some people in my life know bits and pieces, but I can‚Äôt imagine telling anyone I know all of it, I‚Äôm worried they would just have me committed and I REALLY don‚Äôt want that. A few people have said they‚Äôd be sad if I do kill myself but they‚Äôd understand as they‚Äôve watched me suffer for years. I honestly don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm posting this I don‚Äôt know what I hope to achieve from it. Maybe just a release of some of these emotions I‚Äôve been bottling up.  All in all ive seen enough death in my life to know just how inconsequential I am.  Ive seen how my family and most people react to death, They might be sad for a few months, maybe a year or two, but then life happens.  You slowly forget about them, new people enter your life, you become too busy to focus on what once was.  You might remember them on their Bday or around the time they died,  but all in all you move on after a couple of decades i doubt anyone would even really remember me.",behavior

978,"Need feedback on my plan Basically I'm gonna wait until I get my car, and I've got ample time to drive up to where I need to be. Where I need to be is this really tall bridge that most suicidal people use. There's a few issues though. Two main things. First is they ate putting up a railing on the side. It's about the same as a chain link fence so I just need like bolt cutters or something. Next is I feel like I need some motivation. Not like a reason to die, I have plenty of those, but like something to make me less nervous when I'm up there. Can't think of anything atm cause I still need to be able to drive up the bridge.

979,"Emotions are for idiots Emotions are for idiots But we can‚Äôt control them. So what is the point of this essay you mask? Well good question, its more of a place to rant on my feelings. Yep feelings, something I despise since young since they put logic aside and make you act on your immediate needs? I guess so, they can bring you down, up and away. But anyway I uh don‚Äôt know anymore, I guess I fell subject to them. Subject to being addicted to a single person.   Is that love? Probably, but she was the oonly who would give me anttention and compassion. Nobody else really could give me that, since most people just didn‚Äôt care enough or didn‚Äôt know enough to feel relatable. I mean to be fair, she only had a small disorder but I guess she has had her share of rough times. Something we can both relate to. But what is it really that drive these emotion for socializing.   I‚Äôm here, alone, as usual feeling shit because I have nobody to talk to, or anyone that I can just feel free with to be honest. I don‚Äôt know how to put it, its just, that I never ever felt I could be this open with somebody before. I would just share my insides to her and she would accept it? I don‚Äôt know how to say it, she was the only one to care for me and go beyond a certain extend to do it I guess :/.   But what is really happening with me? Why am I depressed? Why do I have to have these disorders for fucks sake. Why can I not go back to 2 years ago where I was a happy person, alone but I didn‚Äôt care at all for going out. Why do I have to have touched this socializing part of me and not be just productive? Why do I have to involve myself into group affairs into social groups which are no more because of some, drama‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶   An environment, I used to be in, surrounded with happy friends and people around me. Somewhere I could just type whatever I wanted, gone. And why? Because people tend to act purely based on emotions with absolutely no fucking filter. Like holy shit how some people can be this incompetent when it comes to socializing? Like jessus fucking christ. We have both sides fuck up in argument because they are both idiots. I want to be with both of them and neither of them.   Cause it hurts, it really hurts but in reality I have nowhere else to go :( so I‚Äôm stuck with these I guess? :( I sometimes just walk down the stairs and hope that the house exploded. Killing everyone inside, or everyone except me. To give me a start of just disappearing, forever. And go where? I don‚Äôt know. I really don‚Äôt know. Actually fuck it let the house take me with it. I just feel shit.   I really want to do something but don‚Äôt. I sometimes stand there in the kitchen, with a knife in my hand thinking whether its better to takes everyones lifes away, or my own or both in turn. Because fuck people. I just hate humans, I hate emotions, we are mechanical beings and I happened to have 100 manufactoring errors.   Like ranging from mental to physical ones. I hate it, I hate it, I really hate this that and everything. It really hurts, it just hurts, it just hurts the screams, the voices, the illusions, they are just there. They are just there making me suffer cause fuck me that‚Äôs why. It pains me so much but nobody out there can relate. Nobody out there can just give me a hug and say ‚ÄúI know‚Äù. Is it that hard anymore, is it that hard to exist in peace. Is it that hard for me to stop pretending that I‚Äôm ok?   I have no reason to be sad, I have no reason to be depressed.

989,"Recently turned 19, mentally I'm at an all time low Now I'd like to preface this by saying I don't really think I'd go through with it, but the thoughts are there and they're getting worse. I haven't fucking talked to any of my friends for a solid 2 weeks now with the exception of a girl who's arguably my best friend at this point. She was feeling sad because secretly she hooked up with another guy in our friend group after they've been talking for a while and now he told he doesn't really feel well with going through with the relationship because he's not feeling mentally there as well. I comforted her and everything went fine and all, and it really sort of grounded me from all these depressive thoughts I'm having.   Anyway, I'm a 19 year old dude who know nothing about fucking anything. Lol never thought I'd be typing that. I'm barely 5'7 with a good face and build and all, but my hair has been falling since 17 and my mental has been spiraling down the fucking drain since I found out via two assholes I used to be friends with teasing me about it on a camping trip. Obviously it's gotten worse and Idk wtf to do. nice segway, because another major issue I'm fucking dealing with is not knowing what TO DO. AT ALL. I'm 19, everyone's going to University here, and even though I got offers, I'm not sure I want to go into debt here in Canada for something I'm not entirely sure about/interested in. Now that's normal but it's so fucking hopeless. Nobody can tell me what to do or what to feel and they're all tired of it because it's all I bring up whenever they ask me if I'm alright or how I'm doing. Always the same shit. I'm rotting away.   I've never experienced anything. I'm just 19 but I already feel old as if my time has already passed. To maintain morale in high school, I just gamed, really. Never dated, never had any girls interested and it's not getting any better now since I'm out of school and deciding if I wanna go to Uni next year or not. My only option is goddamn tinder, as if I'm gonna have any luck there, as a short guy that's also balding for no reason whatsoever. I've never even gotten laid one time while all of my friends have basically. I just don't think I'm cut out for this.   I want to live, I really do but I can't. I don't know how to proceed, all I know is that I wanna have some sort of artistic legacy and I wanna be good at something. I've picked up a guitar but idk how to learn it myself. Meanwhile my physical prime is already ending whereas everyone else's is just starting. I'm short, balding and even though I go to the gym, I'm still alone and feeling more secluded every day as I sit inside with nothing to do except play games and think. It's just so fucking hard dealing with all this shit at this age when everyone else is too busy worrying about girls and whether or not to get shitfaced while I'm worrying about the sad reality that all of this shit I want to experience isn't coming for me. It's not a regular part of MY life all because of shit I can't control. I just fucking can't take this anymore.

I don‚Äôt know if I want advice or want to rant but I just need answers. I‚Äôve had depression since I was 9 years old and have been to counseling and taken medication since then. I‚Äôm 25 now and still depressed. I just want to experience romance, what it‚Äôs like to be loved and wanted by a woman, but that‚Äôs not possible if you‚Äôre a man with depression.  I don‚Äôt know where to begin, so sorry if this is out of order or doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm just tired of being rejected, ghosted, and ignored my entire life. I‚Äôve tried working on myself but my effort is not good enough for anyone. I‚Äôm tired of waiting for the right person to come along. By the time I meet this hypothetical person, she‚Äôs bound to have had tons of experience and I‚Äôll still have none.  Everyone says their teens and 20‚Äôs were the time of their life. People go to parties and clubs, have tons of sex or be in relationships, play sports, join fraternities, get married, and generally have fun with their lives. I clearly missed out. Because of my upbringing and brain chemistry, I can‚Äôt experience life the way the majority of people do. If I can‚Äôt enjoy life, if my perspective is always going to be skewed by depression, what‚Äôs the point of living? To keep everyone else happy that I didn‚Äôt kill myself because THEY would be hurt?

I was talking on the phone to my therapist about it and she felt baffled because I don't actually have options, I can't file for disability and the money would get stolen from me anyways, I can't go homeless, I can't rely on other family members, I have no friends, there are no programs that would accept me because i'm 19, so i'm too old for youth stuff unfortunately, i'm not in school, don't have a license, ID, my birth certificate.

I just want all this to calm down and my suffering to be non-existent, the only feasible way that seems to be the only inevitable route is dying.

start with this new therapist. i immediately told my parents i didn‚Äôt like her and i wanted to switch. they didn‚Äôt listen. in the past year and a half i have begged so many times and they refuse to let me switch. they say she has worked with hundreds of kids and is the best in the city. after a year and a half, i am so so so much worse, and while i don‚Äôt at all blame her for that because that is mostly due to myself and my mental illness, she has offered no help or support at all and has only made me feel worse. i have never felt like we clicked, i feel like she doesn‚Äôt understand what i‚Äôm trying to say. i talk about myself and how i feel and she tells me i am wrong. ljke she is telling me how she thinks i feel instead of listening to me talk. she constantly gets mad at me for ‚Äúnot trying hard enough‚Äù even though i have repeatedly told her that it is hard for me. i struggle with social anxiety so it is hard for me to open up to strangers. she often asks me if there is anything i would like to talk about and then gets mad at me when i say no, even though i have told her i am too anxious to bring my own subjects to talk about. i feel scared about saying the wrong things to her because of how she will react. if she deems that i‚Äôm ‚Äúnot trying hard enough‚Äù she gets my parents involved and tells them to be very strict with me, even though she knows that we don‚Äôt have the best relationship and in the past it has only made things worse. i finish all my homework with maximum effort and she still complains that i‚Äôm not trying. if she doesn‚Äôt think i‚Äôm trying she calls me spoiled and selfish because i‚Äôm not ‚Äúusing the resources im given‚Äù which i totally understand that im very lucky to have parents that can afford and care enough to put me in therapy, but being called spoiled and selfish for ‚Äúnot trying‚Äù even though i am just sends me into a downward spiral of self hatred and makes my depression so much worse. when i tell her about my suicidal thoughts she says im just ‚Äúglamourizing/ glorifying death‚Äù and that i think it‚Äôs cool. which is rlly invalidating because she‚Äôs basically saying im suicidal for attention and because i think it‚Äôs cool. and when i try to calmly explain that i don‚Äôt at all think it‚Äôs cool, but i feel so trapped that i don‚Äôt see any other way out and im in so much unbearable pain that i can‚Äôt survive anymore she tells me ‚Äúno i think you‚Äôre just glamorizing it‚Äù which upsets me further. she tells me to ‚Äúchoose happiness‚Äù which again, i get where she‚Äôs coming from because i know that choosing to have a positive mindset is important to beating depression, but i tell her that it‚Äôs rlly hard for me because no matter how hard i try to be happy i end up even more miserable, she tells me that it‚Äôs my fault for not trying hard enough and that if i wanted to be positive and happy i would. she constantly points out my flaws and not in a therapeutic way. like when she starts session she always says ‚Äúhey how are you‚Äù and i said ‚Äúi‚Äôm good, how are you‚Äù to be polite she says ‚Äúugh that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre supposed to say you have to tell me how your week was, this is why i say you don‚Äôt even try. if you keep this up i‚Äôm going to have to tell your parents you aren‚Äôt trying.‚Äù also, the thing that is currently bothering me the most is her trying to discuss a disorder. now firstly, when she brought it up she said i could reject the diagnosis (non-verbal learning disorder). she told my mom and some teachers too to get multiple perspectives. everyone she talked to (parents, teachers, etc) said that it doesn‚Äôt sound like me at all and i meet none of the criteria. i talked to her about it and said ‚Äúhey i really don‚Äôt feel like i fit this at all, but i‚Äôm open to the diagnosis and would love to hear why you think i have this. if i have NVLD i would love to be diagnosed and get treatment but i don‚Äôt want to be misdiagnosed especially because no one who knows me thinks i have the symptoms.‚Äù so i tried to listen to her with an open mind but the things she said were complete bullshit. like she went over the symptoms list and just said things that were completely false (like things that just never happened) and refused to listen when i told her ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what happened‚Äù for example, last november i was at rock bottom, so suicidal and was failing out of school, so my parents switched me to a small private school with ten kids in my grade. i was so so so angry at them. also, on top of this the kids were actually insane (on my first day there one of them lied about being in sandy hook and another followed me through the parking garage). anyways, i was very angry and sad so instead of hanging out with the other kids during lunch break, i went up to the pharmacy and bought bottles of pills so i could try to kill myself. i spent the majority of my lunch breaks loooking for ways or places to kill myself because at the time my family was being very unsupportive and i wasn‚Äôt allowed to see my friends and i was going through so much. anyways, my therapist brought this up. and she said ‚Äúkids with NVLD often are ‚Äòloners‚Äô or isolate themselves and are socially awkward. you going off on your own during lunch shows this behavior.l‚Äù and i said ‚Äú i was literally trying to KILL MYSELF how are you going to use that as an example??!‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúi think it‚Äôs fair to use that as evidence you have NVLD‚Äù and all of her examples were like this!! and i was like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs literally no solid evidence and no one else who ACTUALLY KNOWS ME thinks i have this disorder it‚Äôs complete bullshit if you have real reasons fine but it‚Äôs not fair to use lies to make this claim instead of listening to me.‚Äù i just feel like it would be way more helpful and productive if i could explain how my brain works and how i interpret things and she tells me if that aligns with NVLD. but when i try that she says ‚Äúyeah that doesn‚Äôt seem like NVLD but i still think you have it‚Äù. like when she asks me a question and i say ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know‚Äù because i don‚Äôt like being put on the spot she says that that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot understanding broad concepts‚Äù so i automatically have NVLD. it‚Äôs just so frustrating. i told her i‚Äôve done so much research and watched so many videos about people talking about their experiences with NVLD and how it affects them and i relate to NONE OF IT and she doesn‚Äôt listen. my mom has done the same thing and also says she doesn‚Äôt see how it relates to me because i‚Äôm good at reading social cues, know what to say, am good at making friends, grasp concepts well, etc. it makes me really mad that she refuses to listen. she makes me feel so horrible about myself. every session with her makes me hate her and hate myself. i‚Äôve begged my parents to quit and they won‚Äôt let me. idk what to do.¬†",attempt

1218,"Fun times. Good morning. How are you?  I remember everything was fine until i was like 4 or 5. A bit after i went to pre school. I was happy. And then i was sad. I cant remember this time anymore. Sometimes iam joking in my head thinking the teacher (or whatever this is called in pre school) did something to me that traumatized me. I had delayed developement. So school was shit. Very hard times. Iam definitly very depressed since age 7. First time i started to think about suicide was puberty. And then age 16 it got really bad to the point were it became part of my personality. ""You can just suicide whenever you want, life sucks anyways"". But what does it do to you thinking about suicide half your life? I mean iam naming it suicide. But its literally killing yourself. More or less brutally. Iam thinking about cutting myself open and bleeding out, or considering if the feeling of shattering bones from jumping of a building is bearable. Iam thinking it, dreaming it and watching other people do it (on the internet). What type person can do this to their own body? Whatever. I have seen therapists. I get therapy. She doesnt even know i have depression. Wonder what happens if she figures it out. I dont tell her. Doesnt change anything anyways. Wonder what happens if she figures out i think about suicide? Psychiatry that takes away all my freedom or medication that takes away all my free will? Hard to talk about your problems like this. Thats all i trust to write. At least that.",behavior

It all started in school as a kid i was an awkward child in a small town, where you grow a reputation quickly, i was quickly known as the kid to stay away from if you want to be popular. I made my peace with it i thought maybe in high school i would have another chance, I quickly found out that wasnt the case, i got bullied like crazy in high school to the point that i really started considering it for the first time. I found out how to tie a noose and i found some rope in my dads workshop and tied one and kept it in my room and for long periods of time i would just look at it considering. I ended up not doing it thinking to myself, It must get better once school is over, that is what everyone keeps telling me they cant be lying right one day its going to get better. Then school ended with me never really having a friend in my life outside of my dog, never once having a sleep over or going to another kids house but i made it threw high school.

Either you can cope and use the tools available to change your life, or you can't. If you can't change things, you can choose to suffer or give up. A lot of people who suffer choose to suffer because they have faith that if they are patient and good the universe will reward them. The universe rewards no one, it's an indifferent system.

She‚Äôs flirted with me a lot, even if she claims she hasn‚Äôt.She knows I like her. I‚Äôve told her a few times. But she made it clear she wants to be just friends.

But I just can‚Äôt be around her, even though all I want to be with her all the time. I just do whatever she wants, I‚Äôm there for her all the time. I let her control me honestly, but then I go and say it‚Äôs not her fault. Not her fault I caught feelings, not her fault it looked like she led me on, I mean hell she spent the night in my house. In my bed. But we‚Äôre just fiends, and that‚Äôs what friends do I guess? It‚Äôs not her fault I get upset over her having sex with other guys. She‚Äôs not my girl, and never will be. I don‚Äôt want to loose her as a friend, but keeping her is killing me too. But the thought of letting her go kills me more. She‚Äôs literally perfect in every way. I thought I was over her, I was catching feelings for someone else. All was good. Then she needed a place to sleep one night, and here I am again. In love with a girl, that doesn‚Äôt want me. While the girl who does want me has no idea. I‚Äôm scared to even try relationships because I don‚Äôt want to led them on. The whole reason my ex and I didn‚Äôt work.

1333,"Is therapy worth it/How to find a therapist? Hi. I'm feeling a little nervous about posting here as I don't want anyone in my real life to find out but I thought this would be a good resource for me. If this post shouldn't go here let me know and I'll take it down.   I'm a first time mom to a 9 month old boy. I've had issues with depression and anxiety since middle school but I've always been able to manage it ok. A few years ago I started taking birth control pills to regulate my hormones which really helped my mental health a lot, so when I got married I just stayed on the pill for preventing pregnancy as well. It clearly didn't work for me, as I now have a 9 month old baby. Since giving birth I've struggled with PPD and PPA, and I needed to start taking some form of birth control again to prevent another pregnancy, but the pill messes with breastfeeding and failed last time so I couldn't do that and got the arm implant instead. I don't know if my current issues have to do with the new implant or just PPD/PPA or just because I haven't been able to take the pill anymore or what, but it's getting bad.   My mental health has declined so much in the last 9 months I feel like I'm not even the same person. It's getting constantly worse and worse every day to the point where I have saved and hidden the bottle of oxycontin they gave me after giving birth (they gave it to me due to complications I won't go into rn), in case I want to take them all at once and end it. I've taken them out of the bottle and just held them in my hand a few times, but I was too weak to go through with it. I know I have enough of them to kill me. I know my husband and son would be better off without me. My son is so young, he wouldn't remember me so he wouldn't truly feel the loss later in life. My husband is young (we're early 20s) and a wonderful man so he could easily find someone else, someone better. I'm toxic and treat him badly. I know he walks on eggshells, the smallest thing can set me off and I have these extreme mood swings, I feel like a crazy person but I can't stop. I completely break down all the time for literally any reason or sometimes no reason. I hate myself. I'm angry and frustrated constantly but I can't show it to my son, I have to make myself smile and play with him and meet his emotional needs, so then I have no energy left for my husband. I'm completely emotionally drained. At the end of every day at I just lay in bed exhausted but unable to sleep, wishing I was dead. I don't want to feel like this anymore, I don't want to feel anything. When I think about death it feels like peace, it gives me comfort. I just want to lay down and sleep and never wake up.   My husband has tried so hard to support me, he took over most of the household chores and is an equal parent when we're both home. I told him I was really struggling and even having some suicidal thoughts but I downplayed it. He begs me to see a therapist but he's scared to push me on it. He tells me all the time he appreciates me, and that he and my son need me. It just makes me feel worse. I've treated my husband so badly and he still is so gentle and caring. He deserves so much better and he'll never leave me and I can't leave him, I cant do this without him, so I should just make the choice for him and he'll be forced to move on and find someone better. He wants me to see a therapist so bad, he's scared and I hate seeing him like this i wish I just hadn't told him. I just can't do this I can't call anyone I can't ask for help I don't want to sit in a room and have someone tell me how shitty I am, I know how shitty I am and I don't need a therapist to tell me about it. what are they going to tell me that I don't already know? How do you even go about finding a therapist? I asked my doctor a couple years ago and she said I have to look into all the therapists in my area and find one that takes my insurance. That feels like an insurmountable hill. Not to mention that even if I find one I might not click with them and I've heard you have to meet several therapists before you find the right one for you I just would rather end it and have this all be over. I don't know what to say to my husband. I have to take my son in for his 9 month checkup in 6 days and they're going to make me fill out that fucking mental health form and I don't know what to do. I dont want to lie, I HATE lying with every fiber of my being, but if I fill it out accurately it'll set off the red flags and they'll have to ask me a bunch of questions and what if they decide I'm not fit to parent because I might kill myselfand  what if they take my son away? What if they call CPS and they try to take him away from me? I would rather die than lose my son.

Then 2 days later on Wednesday I call her crying because I‚Äôm nervous to be a dad. She was mad because her kid could hear the speaker phone and that I need to stop what I‚Äôm doing doing. Hung up on me. Finally called me back. Then started yelling at me again and hung up. I go to where we usually meet up in the morning and see her in the drive through. Try to get in her car. It‚Äôs locked. So I just go home. She hasn‚Äôt talked to me since. Called me a pussy ass bitch mamas boy for crying in the first place. Has bipolar disorder and pregnant. Feel like I‚Äôll never talk to her again. She blocked my number. Think I‚Äôll just wait for her at work and stab myself so she can realize how much I‚Äôm seriously in pain.

But I let my student depression and low self-esteem tell me she didn't love me anymore, so I started seeking attention in the form of chatting to another women. It naturally got found out and, on top of our problems that was the last straw.  So I had to move in with my parents, my narcissistic, abusive mother. This was 2 weeks ago.  I still talk to my wife for arranging time with the kids and some general talk. There's no problems with seeing the kids, she even invited me over yesterday and today for a bit for the kids. I know I shouldn't get any hopes up that she's softening her hard-line of splitting up, but I did because we've talking more.   I worked most of today, I'm a community carer and we had a bit of cheeky banter, I though that maybe she was going invite me over for a bit. But instead we had a cigarette at the door and that was it.   I fucked everything up, I've got no hopes of repairing things with her no matter how hard I want to. Its over I'm on my own and my children are all I have left, but theyre are doing fine without me, maybe even better.

1365,"I really just want to die I‚Äôve felt this way since I was 14, I‚Äôm 18 now. I had toxic friends who told me I couldn‚Äôt be depressed because my life is too good and it wasn‚Äôt possible, they berated me when I started isolating myself, telling me they were scared of me and that I was being a bitch. These people had been my friends for 3 years, I didn‚Äôt have anyone else because I was introverted and shy so I thought I had to stay with them or I‚Äôd have no one. My dad has always been emotionally manipulative and mentally abusive, I was terrified of being left on my own with him until age 12, he made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt worth anything unless I was good at school, which I wasn‚Äôt. I barely passed my GCSEs, I dropped out of A levels when we (the uk) went into the first lockdown because my head of sixth form told me I was just going to fail anyways. I‚Äôve had a string of toxic relationships, been sexually abused a few times. I made really good friendships in the last year but in a matter of weeks I lost all of them and now they all hate me (it was my fault, I made a mistake and I fucked up, I deserved it). I feel so alone and so fucking numb, most days I can‚Äôt get out of bed. I used to get so passionate about things, I used to love so so strongly, but now the only thing I really feel is despair. It‚Äôs like death has a rope tied around me and it‚Äôs slowly dragging me away from everything. I wouldn‚Äôt even care if it just pulled a bit fucking quicker. I‚Äôm not scared of death at all, I haven‚Äôt been for years; I tried to kill myself back in May, I really thought I was going to die and I wasn‚Äôt scared at all, I was relieved that I would finally be able to rest properly. Since then it‚Äôs just gotten worse and all I can think about is how beautiful it would be just to suddenly cease to exist, to finally be at peace. The only reason I haven‚Äôt is because I feel so selfish leaving my mum on her own, she loves me so much and I love her, I just wish she could understand how much pain I‚Äôm in all the time and how difficult it is just to be alive. Actually fuck that, I‚Äôm not alive, I haven‚Äôt been alive for months, I‚Äôm just existing in a world that didn‚Äôt anticipate me surviving this long. Living isn‚Äôt lying in bed crying your eyes out every night. Living isn‚Äôt smiling to everyone and doing such a good job of convincing them you‚Äôre okay after years of practice. Living isn‚Äôt getting up and going about my day in a trance, feeling so numb it‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm watching someone else live my life for me while I crouch in the corner of my mind, shivering and sobbing. The worst part is that I don‚Äôt want to live. I don‚Äôt want to be happy because it makes it so much worse when you go back down again, I don‚Äôt want to be happy because that means having people around and all I‚Äôll do is hurt them. I just wish there was a way to stop existing and make everyone forget I ever existed in the first place. I don‚Äôt want people to mourn for me because I want to die to stop hurting them. I wish people could see how much pain I‚Äôm in and how exhausted I am so that maybe they could understand even slightly why I felt I had to do it. I wish people could just be happy that I‚Äôd be at peace for the first time in so long. I just really really want to die.",attempt

They can justify a person kill themselves if they are suffering with immense physical pain that isn‚Äôt going to go away considering how many options they have tried to reduce the suffering but to no avail.

I don't believe in wallowing in self pity or oversharing on the internet, but sheesh guys this is hard. People go on and on about how you shouldn't feel guilty about not being there, but the truth is that I can't feel anything else. I really do wish that I was in the same room to tell him ""NO!"". I wish I was there to hug him a last time. I wonder a lot if he thought about me ... was I not enough to make him stay?  I've never quite cried this much in my life and my entire world is collapsing into this burning hell on Earth. Everyday when I get up I can't send a stupid snap, share an unfunny history meme, or wonder about the future loudly. Who am I going to go to swim meets with? Who am I going to talk to to? All of a sudden, life is getting very real. Throughout this senior year, I've maintained a really good GPA and kept up with absolutely everything even through quarantine but honestly, I can't do this anymore. It's hurting me to think that life is going to move on.  I attended his funeral a week ago and listening to the pastor was disgusting. He was saying things like ""he chose to leave"". I do not believe that my best friend made the active choice to leave - he felt helpless and lonely - those are not the same thing. I will never believe that one thoughtfully considers the choice of killing themself.  I feel thrown off my path. It sucks to say this, but I'm going to have to prioritize my exams this spring over my mental health or anything else. And also, to hell with society about the stigma around mental health. You live in hell and make others walk through hell as well when you say us guys can't speak about our emotions. To hell with this rotten education system that requires 17 and 18 year olds to make choices about their 40 year-old selves.  I'm going to try to end by saying that it's going to kill me just the same when I have to graduate without him, listen to our favourite songs without him or get married and not have him be my best man.

I knew that covid would negatively affect people with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideations. I‚Äôve lost loved ones to suicide before, and last April was no exception.   I‚Äôve gone to funeral after funeral after funeral. Life doesn‚Äôt promise us anything except that one day it will be over, so until then why not stick it out?  I want to share a couple things that I hope will help some of you out there. My wish is that whoever is reading this will shed light.   ‚Ä¢ We tend to want to disappear in order to be found. We also can want to disappear from existence because we are tired and the burden gets beyond heavy. You‚Äôre more resilient than you think. There‚Äôs always someone out there you may not have met yet who has an open heart and hand to be there for you. Your life and existence is an unique as a fingerprint. It‚Äôs one thing to relate but be careful when you compare. Life isn‚Äôt a Competition as much as a lot of people make it out to be. Sometimes a lot of want to see if ‚Äúanyone cares‚Äù to find us....I‚Äôm telling you people do. Start with me because I do care about you...and I mean it.  ‚Ä¢ Why was I born? To make a difference for yourself and you have the power even in the smallest of ways to make a difference. I‚Äôve asked myself why the hell I had to be born. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt my mom abort me?‚Äù Crap like that. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask to be born.‚Äù Well, I‚Äôm here. I was given life for ME, and at the end of the day you were given life to allow yourself to enjoy. You can be there for people you care about, but you have to take time to look into what it really means to love yourself. Youtube has a lot of videos on self love. I know it seems like a dumb corny idea, but it‚Äôs worth giving yourself a fighting chance. You were born to go on a quest to experience more than just the lame and depressing situations we can feel stuck in. Reach out.   ‚Ä¢ The simple things in life can be more rewarding than you think. Mindfulness helps a ton. It may seem trivial, but as human beings the mind tends to be geared toward: instant gratification, quick fix, NEXT  Take time to actually taste the food and drink. Take time to focus on your body when you take deep breaths to relax. Meditation is underrated.  ‚Ä¢ Loneliness and longing for connection is normal. Amid this uncertain time, there are several platforms on cool new apps to meet new people. It may seem lame but you never know who you‚Äôre going to meet and connect with. You might actually enjoy yourself.   ‚Ä¢ We tend to have habits of thinking and cycles we revisit. The hardest part of breaking any habit is the beginning. Then it becomes easier and more rewarding, because the fruits of labor are.   ‚Ä¢ Allow yourself to be treated as if you were treating someone you love the most. We tend to negative self talk quite often and I‚Äôm telling you to cut that out immediately. We all have to keep ourselves in check but put down the bat. If you like to do art or sing because you like it even though you may feel like you‚Äôre not ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù, do it! Anyone can make art, and it‚Äôs so much healthier for the brain than people think. Don‚Äôt limit yourself. Don‚Äôt sell yourself short.   ‚Ä¢ Bad memories are part of life unfortunately, but there‚Äôs got to be at least one okay memory you have right? If you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúno‚Äù you‚Äôre lying to yourself. It‚Äôs okay, right now you feel like crap and it feels like everything absolutely 100% sucks....but give it a little time....you‚Äôll think of a good memory.....and perhaps (probably) there will be a good time in your future that you wouldn‚Äôt have imagined.

All that I have done is brought people pain.  I may have brought some amounts of happiness to people in my life through things like keeping them company and bringing understanding but this does not change the hurt that I have caused or even come close to outweighing it.   Everybody in my life has left me. I‚Äôm glad they did for their sake. If I ended my life then at least that would be a positive impact. I wouldn‚Äôt hurt or burden anymore people.  I don‚Äôt deserve the life that I was given. I was born into a well off family with plenty of opportunities around me. Any other person would have done great things with their life and helped so many people.   I‚Äôm not good at anything. I have no talents. I have nothing to contribute. It seems my soul purpose in life is to blow my brains out. I am a waste of space who just occupys peoples time with my presence. The world would be better off if I was six feet under.   Even if I was a good person there would be no reason for me to keep going because life has no purpose. Life is a chaotic experience that brings suffering to even the kindest people. People like me only worsen the suffering and hurt around them.   There is no point in living in a universe in which there is no point in doing anything at all. Everything is random. Everything changes. Someday nobody will remember my existence.   I dream of the day I die. If I died I might be able to help someone who is in need of organs. I dream of dieing a heroic death like pushing someone out of the way from a car that‚Äôs about to hit them. Dieing is the only contribution that I can bring for anybody.

It all started in school as a kid i was an awkward child in a small town, where you grow a reputation quickly, i was quickly known as the kid to stay away from if you want to be popular. I made my peace with it i thought maybe in high school i would have another chance, I quickly found out that wasnt the case, i got bullied like crazy in high school to the point that i really started considering it for the first time. I found out how to tie a noose and i found some rope in my dads workshop and tied one and kept it in my room and for long periods of time i would just look at it considering. I ended up not doing it thinking to myself, It must get better once school is over, that is what everyone keeps telling me they cant be lying right one day its going to get better. Then school ended with me never really having a friend in my life outside of my dog, never once having a sleep over or going to another kids house but i made it threw high school. Ontop of all that BS with just being a lonely piece of shit i have always been a failure when it comes to any kind of academics or skills that would lead to some kind of career, I am 25 years old and have never made over 10k a year, no kind of post secondary and no prospects to speak of what so ever. Still living with my mother and she wants me out more and more with each passing month, nothing saved to speak of, at this point i have moved on from the noose and i think about a cliff near my house and have decided when i do it it will be there as i imagine it being the least painful. To add some more shit ontop i am asexual or at least i think i am, as far as i can tell i have never been attracted to a man or women in my life time, never been on a date of course since i have never had a friend and everyday i just want to jump more, there is no enjoyment, no fun just dread of being a poor failure that will be homeless once my mom has had enough and has no chance as success in the future, the most successful future i can hope for is a trash apartment that i can pray i can afford on my cashier salary. I also just found out that I don't have a job anymore I was layed off for the winter and supposed to start again soon now I just found out they don't want me back so seems like just another reason to do it, when nothing good ever happens for you and it is just shit on shit on shit why keep going.

Dad doing his own thing and drug dealing didnt raise me of course. Whenever he did come around he acted like a jealous assshole because he felt my grandma loved me more. Probably why he stole everyone she brought for me and some stuff of hers. When people want to change when they feel like it, everything is ""the past is the past"" but ohh when you do something its different. We will get to that.

Looking back at it now I feel as though they did it to save face and to this day I regret ever getting closer to them. Backfired on me. Never talked about these things and they acted as if nothing happened. I started smoking, i started messing up badly. I started doing sick things.

Went from staying with my aunt after my gma dieedd, to him, to my aunt, to mom, and then got an apartment at 19.

I've been seeing someone twice a week most weeks because I can't make it more than a few days without going into extreme distress. It doesn't help that I'm coming out of a manic episode. I'm  terrified of being locked in my apartment alone, and I'm scared that i don't know what's happening. I don't even care about the virus. If I get it, I'm a high risk, so it might be bad. But we don't have any cases here. I'm more worried about the actions of other people. I have severe gastroparesis and I'm just so done with living a this point because I'm in such a horrible flare.

I'd be normal and happy and smart instead of suicidal for... going on a decade, now?   I'm a high school senior in a specialized school. The reason I came here was to build up my art skills (I have a hella strong passion for animation) and be a child prodigy to prove everyone that I wasn't retarded; my old teachers who looked down on me and didn't even give me the support I needed in k-8, my parents who defended my teachers religiously, the classmates who bullied me ruthlessly, and most of all, myself. And I couldn't even do it.   My grades are low even when I had put in over 13 hours of work some days. Over 70% of the class of 2021 takes AP courses and has a lot of success coming their way, meanwhile I do algebra 2 with grade 10s and struggle my way to not being the rock-bottom member of that class. I'm terrified to even see my GPA. The general ed classes are almost lonely because so many kids are in AP. All my friends are in AP courses and haven't texted me about anything not school-related since the year began. And I don't measure up to my dream schools' standards because I'm a C+ student at best with no accomplishments except being a drama club member for 3 months (which I had to stop in order to get my grades up even though it made me happy.) Not a single one. All because I'm a dumb kid.   So I'm throwing in the towel. Not going to art school. It just... it simply can't be done. There's no point giving myself a several-month headache with the application process when I know for a fact I won't be accepted since I don't measure up. And even if it could, then it's all student loans and burnout and pain and too much responsibility for a 17-year-old to carry, anyways. I hate my life. I hate my present. My past is even worse. And now because of that, the future's pretty fucked up too. I don't know why I got my hopes up. Give me one reason to not take that 15 minute walk to the train station and die in the tracks.

1863,"IDK what to do at this point or where to start Any advice is welcome I really need it now more than ever.    Long Story  So I'm writing this as a last-ditch effort, for a version of myself that wants a better life than I currently have. I‚Äôll try to be as brief as I can, I grew up in a single-parent household with an overly protective religious parent. I am the oldest of three siblings on my mothers' side, I have too many siblings to count on my religious dads‚Äô side.  I grew up taking care of my siblings BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT FATHERS AND OUR FATHERS ARE EITHER DEAD OR TRASH, OR BOTH, and again single black mother with no college education and an indifferent extended family. My immediate family and I were in and out of homelessness throughout my middle &amp; high school years due to both my younger brothers and my mother's frequent sick spells.  At some point during all this, I decided that I was going to commit suicide because I couldn‚Äôt imagine a life beyond being there to helping her and my siblings and I felt pretty empty inside.  Growing up in high school I became aware that I was gay or at least BI and was living in the household that I was living in, this is also around the time I learned that my estranged father died. I became detached and isolated myself in high school and away from my family at home. After a time I became involved with my local community center and did a lot of volunteering to keep busy.  Through volunteering, I was shown that there could be a future beyond my current circumstances. I became the face of multiple programs for teens at the community center.  I graduated high school and managed to get into the college I wanted to attend in a different city. A few program directors as well as the founder of my community center gave me both supplies and some resources to make my first year at university easier.  I was able to meet up with a Community Center alum who was attending the same university I was going to and they were going to show me the ropes. I somehow involved my mother in the process and she suggested that I go to a different campus than the one I had set up so that another member of my estranged family could check in on me.  From that point forward it was a slow march downhill, I realized that I was surrounded by people who knew what they wanted and I had no clue. I was still pretending to be straight and pretending to have my shit together and didn't. In truth, I felt empty, alone, and guilty that I had left my family. I was also reminded that I was poor and university life cost money that I didn't have. I got a credit card and went into debt buying college books. I had an emotional and mental break, I failed out of university. I had a falling out with the nearby family member when I failed out of school because I was without an immediate way home and wanted to try and work and get back into school.  From that point onward I was back to feeling suicidal, I tried to regain lost ground but I was ashamed that I had failed, and let my mentors down. I eventual was able to return home and back to more isolation. My depression grew to the point that some days I was bedridden. That was in 2011 and here I am in 2020 feeling just as lost and isolated, things that I once enjoyed I don't now. I came out to my mom, she initially didn't take it well and to this day doesn't take it well. I feel like I have been lying to myself and others for so long that I no longer know what I want from life or why it's worth living. I feel empty, I want to feel like living again. I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life, I don't know what to do with my career, I‚Äôm in debt to the state and several universities due to me failing classes, I can't afford out of pocket tuition, and have been bouncing from job to job listlessly trying to get into a better financial position while dealing with some of the legit worst people on Earth. I‚Äôm the most overweight I‚Äôve ever been. I‚Äôm just at a loss and I need to figure out where I go from here. I'm tired of feeling this way.  TL;DR  I‚Äôm suicidal, I don't know what to do with my life or career, I‚Äôve been depressed for so long that I‚Äôve lost interest in most things that used to bring me joy. I'm in debt to several educational institutions and am currently unable to continue a formal education because I can't afford it. I am currently very overweight and have always had body dysmorphia issues. I'm currently out of a job Idk what I‚Äôm going to do or if it‚Äôs even worth it to try.

1885,"I envy you To everyone talking about killing themselves because of relationship problems or social anxiety just know that there‚Äôs at least one person who would trade you for your life in an instant. You really have no idea how bad life can actually be.  When I was 18 I watched my grandfather die of cancer. This was my first experience with death and by far the easiest problem I‚Äôve faced since. He was a foundational block in my family that eventually got too old and died peacefully with the rest of us there to comfort him.  Next was my little cousin. I say cousin but he was more like my brother. I talked to him every single day and every single night. He was my best friend. Words cannot describe how much I loved that kid and wish to this day I could trade places with him. He died of a heart attack 3 hours after I got off the phone with him. That kind of pain is beyond what I can type in a post. This happened in 2018 and to this day I wake up absolutely reeling in pain. I‚Äôve screamed until I can‚Äôt, cried endlessly until my eyes felt like they were gonna bleed, and repeated this cycle indefinitely.  After him my uncle was murdered for $1,200 by people I had known for a while. I went to school with their younger brother. My uncle and I ran a little slot machine room and these guys came by pretty often. They were poor like everyone else in my town so we gave them drinks and snacks while they dropped a couple dollars in the machines here and there. After I left for school they stabbed him 39 times. 15 of which was in the face. This was 3 days before his son who I have helped raise since I was littles birthday. I had to look this kid in the eyes and tell him everything was going to be ok when I knew it wasn‚Äôt. This was the second hardest thing I‚Äôve ever lived through.  After all the death my mom thought it would be a good time to split after numerous accusations of infidelity on both sides so she took off. Dad being the fucking prick he is got mad and burned my family home down.  Now I get to tell you all about what my A1 parents were doing while my entire life was crumbling before 20 year old eyes. I begged and pleaded them to let me come home from college. All I wanted to do was be around my family and friends. To give myself a chance to at least try to heal from the horrible fucking trauma that was continuously happening in my life. They weren‚Äôt having it. They ridiculed and threatened to cut me off of everything if I dared leave. I was fucking dying inside and they they forced me to fucking watch from the sidelines. But it‚Äôd be too easy to just isolate me from everything happening. No instead they had to make sure to weaponize me every single chance they had to attack one another. Every time they pissed each other off during this horrible fucking multi-year long divorce they made sure to call me screaming. I heard every. Single. Detail. I read my dad‚Äôs suicide notes. I watched the fucking videos where he ‚Äúfinally was gonna do it this time‚Äù fucking prick I wish he did. My mom was just as crazy. Every single day it was something else with her. Bashing her car into my dads truck. Sneaking into his new apartment slashing his beds and bleaching his clothes. I come from a small town so everyone I knew was watching this happen with me. I‚Äôd almost be embarrassed if I wasn‚Äôt so busy literally trembling to the point where I couldn‚Äôt be in public. At this point I hadn‚Äôt left my room in years. Honestly that‚Äôs not even the full story but I don‚Äôt have any energy left to type the rest out.   TLDR: My life is quite literally a worse case scenario. I still think about suicide every now and then but DON‚ÄôT FUCKING KILL YOURSELF OVER BULLSHIT RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS OR GENERAL ANXIETY. You are redeemable.",ideation

But everyone I meet online only either wants to flirt with me or use me as a onesided venting opportunity/therapist.   They don't even try to know me.   Nobody wants to know my personality first it seems. I've made a few friends, but I've also upset a few communities because people hit on me and I'm not okay with it.    Everyone's too comfortable with getting the answers the desire, and too comfortable with just shallow appearances.   I'm just upset that people laugh it off.

Then, it must mean that I'm not worth it, because, how else can I explain it?  I'm toxic, poison and a fucking coward who can't even talk to people to make things right. I made a list, and I feel that I need to talk to at least 30 people to either apologize or to try to reconnect... Yet I don't have the guts to do it.  Who am I kidding? Many people tried to help me, to turn me away from the path of the broken idealist, but I didn't listen, and because of my inmaturity, clinginess, insecurity and constant mistakes I drove them away...

I don't want to dress up in a fancy dress that day because all of them make me look fat. I can't drink because I'm on meds, plus I don't like alcohol, and either of these things are going to make me a social outcast for now on, making it harder to make friends, let alone find someone to date. Why? Because guys my age don't like women who are prudes/don't party and alcohol is a HUGE part of the college experience.   I've hated college so far, and I literally have classes tomorrow. The only thing that's keeping me going at this point is the idea that I only have to make it until my 21st birthday until I can legally overdose and drink a pint of vodka if I really want to.

1965,"Why I Believe my Life is Simply Not Worth Living (1st post, please read) I'm a 16 year old girl &amp; I've recently realized that life isn't as good as I was once thought it was. For my entire childhood I've felt chronic melancholy or this horrible feeling that something was horribly wrong, even though there wasn't. As far as I know, I had a very healthy and loving upbringing, but for some reason I've always felt like I was put here on this planet to be hated, it's almost like a fact to me. Even when I was 4 years old I strongly believed this, &amp; I still do, &amp; I have no idea why. I have had chronic depression since 7th grade, very bad social anxiety, germaphobic OCD, lots of anxiety about tons of different things, horrible attention span/focusing issues, &amp; now I have POCD, which has made me the saddest out of all of these. I hate school SO much. Even writing one sentence for an English project saps all my energy. I have about 5 hours of homework every day but I usually only do a bit or sometimes none. What's bothering me now is that I have thought horrible things in the past, like when I was 8th grade I said I wanted to ""shoot up"" my school because I thought everyone hated me, even though they probably didn't at all. And I think I really did. I hate myself for saying this. It's weird to think that I said that because I'm such a different person now. But sometimes I get scared that maybe if I was pushed enough I would think that again. I don't feel like I would, but then again how do I know? I've never even killed a fly, I feel too bad. I'm just so confused &amp; I'm not scared of death because my life has been more painful and terrifying than death will ever be.
