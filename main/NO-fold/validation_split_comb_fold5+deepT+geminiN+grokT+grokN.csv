70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument.

449,"The simplest ways to help a friend who is struggling are often the most forgotten. A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,indicator,indicator,True

No smell was found by the cops. I'm so tired. My heads messing with me. I just wanna leave this place. I got diagnosed with MS recently it's hard to deal. I just know I'm gonna be wakened if I fall asleep. It never fails. I cant take this torture from these people. I want to leave. I have no money to just walk out or i would.

460,"A great way to end an awful year. I had so many friends before now. I had lived my entire life a lonely bastard at school but this quarantine i finally got some online friends and guess what? Fucked it up. I sent my (ex) boyfriend creepy messages because i'm a fucking idiot and of course no one wanted to be friends with me anymore. I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic. No one from my real life, no classmates or family, none of them. just some random woman who lives on an entire different continent. I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve. I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,behavior,behavior,True

486,"What about a retirement plan?. I have contemplated suicide for years, I know I am going to do it but I want experience a few more things before I do. im unsure how long that will take maybe in my 20's or 30's. Here's my problem. right now Is a perfect time to start a retirement plan for me. If I wait 10 years I'll never be able to retire. but why should I save up so much money only leaving myself enough to get by if I plan to be dead long before I retire.

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you.
