People do things, but why? they study, work, want to go somewhere in life, but where does the desire come from? I have never experienced that, never. Theres no space for me around these parts, no space.

Ive seen the way they talk about me and while its not malicius or anything like that its obvious they try to not talk about me. I think theyre gonna be better off without me, everyone is going to be better without me. Im too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird. Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant if there was a button i could press that would erase all traces of my existence i wouldnt even doubt it, id go for it.

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,attempt,attempt,True

I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family?

The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die and I'm scared of the emptiness after death that all I can do is cry myself to sleep and hope that I don't wake up and do wake up at the same time.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,Attempt,attempt,True
336,"Why did I have to get such a horrible life compared to my peers. And of course I can't consoling about it because I know some Petersonain victim blamer is going to come here and tell me to work harder; even though I am doing all the right things. My life sucks solely because of factors outside of my control. Life for many is nothing more than a total curse and for others it is paradise. We are working longer and harder for less and less all to satisfy endless Billionaire greed. A factory worker in the 50s-70s had a higher standard of living than a young professional does now. Being a Man it is hard for me to find love and I am attacked for dating to have standards (just want a fair deal (and no I am not talking about looks); I am not asking for some blonde hair princess). Women can valuation and offers while a Man has to do all the work (yay equality amirite /s). I've been bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life. My parents won't accept me for who I am because I do not believe the harsh faith I was raised and have no way out cause I don't have a loving partner to go to. And I have other issues with them. You try living through South Asian Muslim culture (even in the west). I have nothing but whenever I complain I'm attacked, victim blames, and some sociopath out here is going to kick me when I am down. 99% of your life is luck; that's one thing I'm sure off. Hard work and all the rest can make some improvements on the margins but luck is the core determinant",0,indicator,indicator,indicator,True

I used to love making shit. I used to love trying and experimenting and wasting time because it wasn't a waste to me. But capitalism and instant gratification has irreparably fucked up my brain. I don't want to anymore. It wasn't supposed to happen to me but it did. I don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have. I don't know anything anymore. I hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't. And that's life too. Is it alright to work a corporate job you're content with and live a mediocre existence?

396,I'm a complete lost cause and nothing I do can change it. All I have ever done since I got back from uni was become constantly stuck. I've never had any skills that are useful to anyone. My family are giving up on me my dad hardly talks to me and I'm a constant burden on my sister and I'll never be able to help my mum in anyway. Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family.

407,"I feel totally helpless and misunderstood. I have paranoid delusions and the world is just so rotten to me. I don't even hate myself at all anymore, but I still want to find a way to get away from it all. I'm so sick of every worthless person around me. I've told two people about my feelings and got fed the bullshit I expected to receive. One told me it goes away over time, which it didn't. The other one, now that I think of it, didn't tell me anything beyond his own experiences which weren't related to mine. Does anyone else feel the way I do?

I'm alone and she's never going to comeback. Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself? It's perfectly reasonable. People like me are just fundamentally wrong and can't be helped. I'm a dependent person. I need her and she needs to be alone. So that means I need to die because it's better than living in pain. I don't know what to do.

I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore.
