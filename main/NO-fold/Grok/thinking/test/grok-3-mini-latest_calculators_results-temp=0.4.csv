0,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.'Tired.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include severe emotional distress following a breakup, feelings of hopelessness, persistent thoughts and dreams about the ex-partner, attempts to cope (e.g., talking to others, taking Prozac, engaging in new activities), and expressions of exhaustion and tiredness. There are mentions of being ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it,"" which suggest vague dissatisfaction with life, but no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, weakness, and despair, but no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" imply general exhaustion and possible indirect distress, they are not direct or explicit. Given the rules, when unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but nothing here suggests even ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post primarily refers to past events (e.g., the breakup 6 months ago and starting Prozac in December) and current ongoing feelings of distress, but there are no clear references to future intentions or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post expresses general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and emotional pain without any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks explicit suicidal expressions. Even with vague phrases, the rules emphasize choosing 'Indicator' when in doubt about explicitness.

1,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of death and suicide, such as the sister's suicide (""ended her life"", ""made attempts in the past""), the user's own past attempt (""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago""), and emotional indicators like hopelessness, pain, doubt, and a welcoming of ""a welcome end to everything"". There are expressions of not wanting to feel current pain and contemplating permanent sleep, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described. References to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, for both the sister and the user's past attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" and ""the idea of that state lasting forever is hard to turn away from"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are detailed.
   - Since there are no explicit plans or preparations, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events (sister's suicide and user's own past attempt) as well as current feelings of ideation. The focus includes historical actions but also current suicidal thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes the user's past attempt at suicide, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. Although there are current expressions of suicidal thoughts, these do not include plans, so it does not fit 'behavior' or 'ideation' as the primary category. The definition of 'Attempt' specifies content describing past attempts, and this post meets that criterion without overriding current plans.

2,"I'm scared therapy wont work. My parents realized 'omg hey our kid isn't really doing all that well' and now I'm going to therapy. Which is good. But I worry therapy won't work. Even on days where I'm actually happy I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts. And it's tempting a lot of the time. I'm tired of always being afraid and upset over little things, I'm tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation. I wish I could be so much better than I am so I didn't live every moment in shame. Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of fear about therapy not working, parental concern, persistent negative thoughts (specifically ""lol kermit sewer slide"" which is slang for suicide), emotional indicators like tiredness, shame, hopelessness, and a desire for improvement. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts. The emotional tone shows despair and distress but focuses on ongoing thoughts rather than actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""lol kermit sewer slide,"" which is a common internet slang for suicidal thoughts or actions (referring to jumping into a sewer as a metaphor for suicide). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user describes these thoughts as ""tempting a lot of the time,"" indicating a desire to not be alive. Since this is a recognizable reference, it qualifies as explicit in context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. The post only discusses thoughts without detailing how they might be carried out, so it does not reach the level of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and ongoing thoughts and feelings, not past events or future intentions with specifics. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (via ""kermit sewer slide"" and its temptativeness), fitting the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves a desire to not be alive without any specific plan. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'Indicator.' There's no plan or preparation, so it's not 'Behavior' or 'Attempt.'

If it doesnt work out. my suicidal ass and a lot of alkohol alone at home. you see where this is going. Imma probably relapse this night. Maybe imma forget the urge from alcohol and nicotine but probably not',2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of death and suicide, such as ""my last day on this shitty world,"" ""suicidal ass,"" and implications of ending life. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like calling the world ""shitty"" and expressing a desire to ""restart"" for better ""stats."" Specific plans or preparations are noted, such as ""i should start writing the letters"" (possibly suicide notes) and using ""a lot of alkohol alone at home"" as a potential method. There's a reference to potential relapse, which might imply past self-harm, but it's not clearly described as a past attempt.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal ass"" and ""my last day on this shitty world.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements implying farewell and ending life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, alcohol is referenced as a substance (""a lot of alkohol alone at home""), which could be a means for self-harm or suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""i should start writing the letters"" suggests preparing notes, and there's a timeline with ""Sunday"" as the last day and ""only a few hours left.""
   - Since there are clear indications of methods and preparations, this leans toward 'behavior,' but if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation'; however, the details here make it explicit.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This primarily refers to current or future intentions, such as events planned for tomorrow, Sunday as the last day, and potential relapse ""this night."" There are no specific descriptions of past attempts, though ""relapse"" might hint at history without details.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die, which rules out 'indicator.' It goes beyond just ideation because it includes specific preparations (writing letters) and methods (alcohol), fitting the 'behavior' category. There's no clear description of a past attempt, so 'attempt' doesn't apply. Based on the definitions, this is best classified as 'behavior' due to the explicit plan elements.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The user mentions relapsing after 6 months, expresses doubt about recovery (""I don't think I'll ever recover""), worries about someone finding out, and discusses the impact on their girlfriend. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and distress, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to a past event (""relapsed after 6 months"") and current feelings (worry about telling the girlfriend), but there are no indications of future intentions related to suicide. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it involves dissatisfaction and worry without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family,"" and ""I want to kill myself."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like ""Life just gets more and more overwhelming and difficult,"" ""I'm just in a rut with a very small support system,"" and feelings of being ""weak and pathetic."" Specific plans are referenced, such as wanting to die at a particular time (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") and possibly preparing by contacting people (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"").

Not explicitly (no tools or substances are detailed), but there is a clear indication of a plan, including a specific time (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") and potential preparation (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out,"" which could imply saying goodbyes or setting up the act). This constitutes signs of preparation tied to the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""tomorrow""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself"") and mentions a specific plan (time and potential actions like contacting people), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the inclusion of planning elements. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

6,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of being ""done"" and ""happy"" in a contradictory manner, struggles with school leading to neglect of hygiene, return of nervous tics, self-harm through cutting, seeking help from a psychologist without resolution, faking school attendance, a past plan to kill themselves in January that didn't happen, and a current plan to hang themselves in the forest after cutting off a finger. There are explicit mentions of death and suicide, emotional indicators of hopelessness and unmotivation, specific plans (hanging with a rope, using an axe), and references to past self-harm (cutting).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user states ""I planned to kill myself"" and ""I plan to hang myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through phrases like ""it's time to stop the lie and end it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including hanging with a rope in the forest, cutting off a finger with an axe, and using a car. Signs of preparation are present, as the user says ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car."" This clearly indicates explicit planning, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events, such as self-harm through cutting and a previous plan in January that didn't occur. It also describes current and future intentions, with ongoing preparations for suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts along with specific plans and preparations (e.g., methods, tools, and location). This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it involves explicit planning. Although there are references to past self-harm, the current plans take precedence, and the rules specify labeling as 'attempt' only if it primarily describes past attempts, but here the focus is on active preparation.

(Maybe cushion the pain idk. )I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and dying, such as ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" and ""slowly kill myself this way."" There are explicit references to self-harm through anorexia, with details like current weight (90 pounds), goal weight (78 pounds or lower), and the desire to ""look like a fucking skeleton when I die."" Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, as the user expresses intentions to die via starvation. Specific plans or methods are referenced, such as continuing with anorexia to reach a lethal weight. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""slowly kill myself this way"" and ""for it to finally kill me.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""I'm going to let myself pass away"" and the overall intent to die through weight loss.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details a method of suicide through anorexia and intentional weight loss to a point that will cause death (e.g., aiming for 78 pounds or lower). This includes the means (starvation via anorexia) as a deliberate plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user is actively pursuing a goal weight and rationalizing the process, which indicates ongoing preparation.
   - Since a specific method is described, this goes beyond ideation into behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions, as the user discusses ongoing actions (current weight, new goal) and future outcomes (dying slowly to allow others to adjust). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and includes a specific plan (method of starvation via anorexia), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions of killing oneself. It is not merely 'ideation' because a method is specified. There are no past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.

8,"Can't do any of it!. Just don't want this anymore just wanna sleep and never ever wake up""Marvellous now the fainting episodes are back ffs.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and exhaustion (""Can't do any of it!. Just don't want this anymore""), a desire to ""sleep and never ever wake up"" which implies a wish for permanent escape or death, and a mention of ""fainting episodes are back"" indicating possible health issues or distress. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, but no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as ""wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" suggests a desire to end one's existence. Since this is a clear indicator of suicidal thoughts, even if not using the word ""suicide,"" it leans toward explicit expression.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or any concrete plans, so this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This appears to refer to current feelings and intentions, with no indication of past events or attempts. The fainting episodes might be ongoing health issues but are not linked to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses a desire to not be alive anymore (""wanna sleep and never ever wake up""), which fits the definition of Ideation as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not Indicator, and lacks any plan or past attempt, ruling out Behavior or Attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying explicitly through phrases like ""face death,"" ""until I die,"" and ""if I survived,"" implying a potential fatal outcome. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""I'm done,"" ""too pissed,"" and ""don't even want to feel good anymore."" There are no mentions of self-harm or suicide directly, but the context suggests a risky behavior. Specific plans mentioned include ""start working out until I die or pass out,"" which could be interpreted as a method, though not a standard one. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""face death"" and ""until I die,"" which indicate a desire for death. Since this is somewhat explicit but not using the term ""suicide,"" I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the expressions of wanting to die qualify as suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post mentions ""working out until I die or pass out,"" which implies a method of overexertion leading to death, but it's not a clear or standard suicide method like tools, substances, or locations. There are no signs of preparation like acquiring means or writing a note. Since this is uncertain as an explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""I'm now gonna start working out"" and ""I'll be back in 12 hours if I survived."" No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""face death""), fitting Ideation, which covers suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It does not qualify as Behavior because the method is not explicit or standard as defined (e.g., no tools or preparations). It is not Indicator due to the presence of desires to die, and it is not Attempt as there are no past actions mentioned.

What am I doing.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of attempting to end one's life, self-harm (e.g., bleeding wrists and thighs from a knife), emotional indicators of distress such as shaking, bawling, hopelessness, and despair (e.g., ""Living life as a shell is bullshit"" and ""I was ready to leave everything""). There are references to suicide, a specific method (knife), and an interrupted action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), with direct expressions of wanting to die or end life (Yes), such as ""I just attempted to end my life,"" ""I almost committed,"" and ""I was ready to leave everything.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (e.g., knife), and there are signs of preparation or action (e.g., holding the knife, attempting to use it, resulting in bleeding). This goes beyond ideation into actual behavior, but since it describes an action taken, it's not just planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a very recent event (""I just attempted""), describing it as having just happened, with no clear future intentions beyond the immediate past action. It focuses on a concrete event that occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action of self-harm with the intent to end life (e.g., bleeding from cuts), which qualifies as a past attempt. According to the definitions, this fits ""Attempt"" because a physical action happened in the past, even if incomplete. It does not fit ""Indicator"" due to explicit suicide mentions, ""Ideation"" due to the presence of action, or ""Behavior"" as the primary focus is on the attempt rather than ongoing planning.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused.

Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""having a lot of suicidal thoughts,"" expresses feelings that ""it would be better if I was dead,"" and discusses death as ""eternal sleep"" which seems appealing. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, such as not seeing the point of daily efforts, feeling empty after activities, and questioning the value of life despite having friends, family, and motivations. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts. Instead, the user lists reasons against acting on these thoughts, like responsibilities to a dog, family, and friends.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states ""having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" and expresses desires like ""it would be better if I was dead"" and ""suicide would be better.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases indicating a desire for death as a preferable state.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post focuses on thoughts and barriers to action, not on planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current thoughts and feelings, with no mention of past attempts or future plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to be dead), which fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves desires to end one's life without any specific plan. There is no mention of methods or preparations, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior.' It is not about past attempts, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. While there is distress, the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts pushes it beyond 'Indicator.'

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain . I'm so scared I've never done anything like this before and I'm so scared of the pain I will cause to my parents and family .

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of suicide, such as ""suicide is on my mind,"" and expresses intentions to act, like ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it"" and ""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feeling like a failure, and overwhelming anxiety. Specific plans or methods mentioned: knife and pills as means, and the bathroom as a location. Preparations implied: the user is about to act. References to past events: a mental breakdown in 2019, but it's not described as a suicide attempt.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicide is on my mind.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I'm ready to do it"" and ""I don't want to do this but I've run out of options.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, knife and pills.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user describes being about to lock themselves in the bathroom with these items.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions, as indicated by ""about to lock myself in the bathroom"" and the current time (""It's currently 6 in the morning""). Past events are mentioned (e.g., 2019 breakdown), but they do not constitute a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (methods like knife and pills, and preparation like going to the bathroom), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' because of the detailed plan, and not 'Attempt' as it describes current intentions rather than past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of 42 unnamed pills (possibly antidepressants and allergy medicine), the ease of swallowing them, repeated past threats of suicide without action, current possession of means, and explicit statements about intending to die tonight. There are clear references to death and dying (""I'm so ready to die,"" ""tonight I'm gonna do it""), emotional indicators of hopelessness (e.g., antidepressants didn't work, feeling out of it), specific preparations (having the pills and describing them as easy to swallow), and implied past attempts through repeated threats.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I'm gonna do it"" and ""I'm so ready to die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements such as ""I'm so ready to die"" and the context of planning to use the pills.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details the pills (42 unnamed ones, possibly antidepressants and allergy medicine) as the means, including their size for easy swallowing, which implies an overdose method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions having the pills and specifies a time (""tonight""), indicating preparation.
   - Since there is clear mention of methods and preparation, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (repeated past threats without action) and current/future intentions (planning to act tonight). The focus is on imminent plans rather than solely past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'm so ready to die"") and a specific plan (using pills tonight, with details on the means), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' due to the presence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no concrete past action is described (only past threats).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include frequent crying, constant dark thoughts, feeling abused by one's own brain, guilt associated with crying, and a sense of weakness due to these experiences. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, as the user describes ongoing dark thoughts despite efforts to relax (e.g., yoga in the bath). There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post refers to ""dark thoughts"" and self-criticism but does not explicitly indicate a desire to end one's life. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or method, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current, ongoing experiences (constant dark thoughts and crying) rather than past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' as it involves vague dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post are about the user's experience with music as a coping mechanism for mental health. They mention that music distracts them, keeps them content, and helps them through entire days. They prefer softer and 'sad' music and share a song recommendation. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include a vague reference to ""mental health or lack of,"" suggesting some general distress, but it's framed positively as something music helps with. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post is about coping strategies, so it's unclear at best, and I should lean toward 'indicator' in such cases.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there's no indication of any planning, this doesn't factor into a higher category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current coping mechanisms (e.g., using music now), not past events or future intentions related to suicide. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post lacks any explicit expressions concerning suicide, focusing instead on general mental health coping through music. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it includes general expressions of distress without direct mention of suicidal thoughts.

Key elements include mentions of death (e.g., ""my death,"" ""when I'm dead"") and a desire to see reactions to it. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of frustration, despair, and hopelessness due to ongoing breathing problems from Covid since March 2020. The user mentions their life isn't worth living, feeling helpless, angry, and sad, having left university with a useless degree, living on social welfare, and hating the world and people. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and general dissatisfaction with life. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though phrases like ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" imply despair, they do not explicitly state a desire to die. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. This aligns with 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit suicidal expressions. Even though there is significant dissatisfaction with life, the absence of direct suicide references means it does not qualify as 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

18,TW: *Mention of self harm*\n\nI wish I had someone to talk to. I recently had really bad anxiety last night. When I do spiral I text my bf and he ends up worrying for me. I didn't text him the rest of the day because I was trying to recollect myself and I know he's busy working. \n\nHe later texted me that he was worried the whole day. I called him to let him know I was doing better and let him know what happened. \n\nNow I feel guilty for worrying him and he said his head hurt and he's going to sleep. Maybe he won't say anything but I feel like I worried him for nothing. Now I feel like I should stop texting him for a few days because I honestly feel like a burden. \n\nI can't keep it all to myself. I end up going to a dark place and feel alone. I self-harmed one time a from anxiety and guilt that snowballed. I feel those thoughts creeping up and I really don't want it to lead to that. \n\nI also just have a hard time opening up to friends. Mostly because I feel like there needs a place and time. I'm getting better at opening up more and more but it takes time and mental health discussions are something that I haven't worked towards yet. It's probably the hardest obstacle for me.\n\nThere's no way I can afford any therapy to help with these habits right now. I don't have a summer job and I'm going to college in the fall so I may have to save some money or something.\n\nI suppose I can try counseling again at the university. I just hate that it takes a while to get an appointment. Thank you for anyone who's finished reading this.',0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of anxiety, guilt, feeling like a burden, difficulty opening up, past self-harm, and current ""dark thoughts"" that the user wants to avoid. There are mentions of emotional distress such as loneliness and worry about relationships, but no direct references to death, dying, or suicide. Self-harm is mentioned once as a past event (""I self-harmed one time""), and there's a vague reference to ""going to a dark place"" and ""those thoughts creeping up,"" which could imply distress but not explicitly suicidal content. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past suicide attempts, only self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post discusses feeling like a burden and dark thoughts, but these are not direct expressions of a desire to die.
   - Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No; there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but there's no indication of even ideation here, so it doesn't apply.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., a single instance of self-harm) and current feelings of distress, but there are no indications of current or future suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post expresses general distress, sadness, and mentions past self-harm, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator'. It does not qualify as 'Ideation' due to the absence of explicit suicidal thoughts, 'Behavior' due to no plans, or 'Attempt' since the self-harm mentioned is not described as a suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct mentions of wanting to die and suicide, such as ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die because of them."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, as the user expresses distress over their sexual feelings and self-labeling as a ""pervert."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""Should I kill myself?"" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, ""I want to die because of them."" This is clear and not vague, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no details about methods, locations, or preparations, this does not qualify as 'behavior,' and I should choose 'ideation' if uncertain.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I want to die""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of procrastination, fatigue, and thoughts about death. Specific mentions include ""I could be dead by the end of the day today,"" ""put it off til later,"" and ""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas."" This indicates references to suicide and self-harm through phrases like ""off myself,"" which is slang for suicide. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and exhaustion, with the post suggesting that fatigue might be a barrier to action. There are no references to past attempts, but there is an implication of a method involving ""buy the gas.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I could be dead by the end of the day"" and ""off myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the post describes thoughts of ending life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post references ""buy the gas,"" which implies a method for suicide (e.g., using gas for inhalation or other means).
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is an indirect sign in not leaving the house to acquire the gas, suggesting a contemplated plan, though not fully acted upon.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with planning, so I classify it as 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as seen in ""I could be dead by the end of the day today,"" indicating immediate thoughts rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""buy the gas""), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation by referencing a means, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, loneliness, dissatisfaction with upbringing, and a troubled relationship with the father. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""Im going to to kms right now,"" ""Is it worth to end it,"" and ""i want to end ittt."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and lack of motivation. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, nor references to past attempts. The post focuses on current feelings of distress.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kms"" (kill myself) and ""end it."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements indicating a desire to end life. Since these are explicit, it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No, such as no mention of notes or acquiring means. Since no explicit plan is present, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions and feelings, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts; it's focused on the present state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to end life) but lacks any specific plan or preparations. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves desires to die without detailing how. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Behavior' due to no plan, or 'Attempt' due to no past actions described.

22,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die, such as ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to,"" ""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would,"" and ""maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, including feelings of isolation, worthlessness, and a lack of purpose, such as ""There's no point to anything,"" ""I'm at a dead end,"" and descriptions of strained family relationships. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or steps taken). No references to past attempts are present; instead, the user explicitly states they have never attempted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the user directly refers to ""suicide"" and phrases like ""killing myself"" and ""wanting to."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), such as ""despite wanting to"" and ""I feel like killing myself."" This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods are mentioned (e.g., no references to tools, substances, or locations). There are no signs of preparation (e.g., no mention of acquiring means or writing a note). Since there is no explicit plan, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current or ongoing feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I feel like killing myself""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described, as the user confirms they have never attempted.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die (e.g., ""wanting to kill myself""), which fits the definition of ideation. However, there is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not an indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and it is not an attempt since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress such as hopelessness and despair. Phrases like ""my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with,"" ""feel more and more defeated,"" ""never be out of this torture cycle,"" and ""why keep going?"" indicate a desire to end suffering. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?,"" which imply a desire to end one's life. Since this is not a very explicit mention of suicide itself, but there are clear indicators of suicidal thoughts, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the expressions qualify as explicit desires to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plans, methods, or preparations are indicated, if it were borderline for 'behavior,' I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""now my brain is screaming,"" ""why keep going?""), with no reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""give up and get it over with""), but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation.' It goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'Indicator,' and there's no plan for 'Behavior' or past attempt for 'Attempt.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, a desire for love and emotional support, and a statement about depression being the user's fate. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include feelings of hopelessness and sadness, such as the need for emotional support and the phrase ""depression is my fate."" There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general distress and dissatisfaction with life but does not mention suicide or a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear or absent, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings of loneliness and depression but does not mention past events, past attempts, or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings expressed. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of severe mental distress from schizo-affective disorder, lack of sleep, paranoia about being hurt, feelings of deterioration, and a desire to ""get it over with."" There are indirect mentions of death or dying through phrases like ""get it over with"" and ""go through with it,"" which imply ending one's life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""I'm deteriorating""), fear, and reluctance to seek help. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""the pain if I go through with it"" suggest a desire to end one's life, indicating suicidal thoughts. Although not crystal clear, this leans toward explicit expressions of suicidal feelings.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is detailed, if it qualifies for a higher category, it would be ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (e.g., ""go through with it""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) without any specific plan, which aligns with Ideation. It goes beyond general distress (as in Indicator) due to the implied desire to not be alive, but lacks the elements of planning required for Behavior or a past attempt for Attempt.

They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead""), mentions of self-harm through daily heroin use, emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and anger towards family and medication, and a reference to a past negative experience with antipsychotics. There are no explicit mentions of specific suicide methods like tools or locations, but heroin use is noted as ongoing behavior. No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead""). Since these are clear indicators of suicidal thoughts, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but here it's evident enough for ideation consideration.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, heroin use is described as daily and tied to the hope of dying soon, which can be seen as a substance/method for self-harm. Are there signs of preparation? The post implies ongoing preparation through regular heroin use, with a timeline (""Within 4 weeks""), but it's not highly detailed. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but the self-harming behavior elevates it.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current actions (daily heroin use) and future intentions (dying soon and being forced into an institution), with a brief mention of a past event (taking antipsychotics once). It focuses more on present and future than past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and exhibits self-harming behavior (daily heroin use as a potential method), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the active self-harm, even without a highly detailed plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and a desire not to wake up, such as ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow,"" which implies thoughts of death. Emotional indicators include despair, loneliness, and tiredness, as in ""Tired of being alone."" There is a reference to a past attempt with ""attempt properly again,"" but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., the word ""suicide"" is not used), but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow."" This is somewhat explicit, so it's not unclear, but it leans toward suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, or signs of preparation are mentioned. The post refers to a potential future attempt vaguely, but without details, so I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' due to the lack of explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings (e.g., hoping not to wake up) and implies future intentions (e.g., getting depressed enough to attempt again), while also referencing a past attempt. It mixes current ideation with a hint of past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not wake up and reference to attempting again) without any specific plan or method, which fits 'Ideation'. Although a past attempt is mentioned, the primary focus is on current thoughts rather than detailing past actions or current plans, so 'Ideation' is the best fit over 'Attempt' or 'Behavior'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""wanna disappear from this universe"" is vague and could imply a desire to not exist, but it is not a direct expression of wanting to die or commit suicide. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or method, so if it were to be considered for a higher category, it would not qualify.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include multiple mentions of death, dying, and suicide, such as ""I don't want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefully,"" ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""I wanted to do it myself but I chickened out,"" and expressions of regret for not being hit by a car. Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, and frustration with social rejection. There are no clear references to specific plans, methods, or preparations, though he describes a passive wish for a car accident. No explicit references to past attempts are present, only a mention of chickening out, which suggests unfulfilled intentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I want to kill myself so bad"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I don't want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefully"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances are detailed; he only expresses wishes for external events like being hit by a car, which does not constitute a plan. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of acquiring means or making preparations.
   - Since no explicit plan is described, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post primarily refers to current and ongoing feelings of despair, with a mention of a recent event (nearly getting hit by a car) and past intentions (""I wanted to do it myself but I chickened out""), but it focuses on present suicidal thoughts rather than completed past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, fitting the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not an indicator due to the explicit mentions, and it is not an attempt since no concrete past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of social isolation, bullying, loneliness, and emotional distress (e.g., ""People bully me everywhere,"" ""I feel lonely,"" ""I feel like I am on the moon,"" ""Nothing fills the hole in my heart""). There is an explicit mention of suicide: ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as feeling disconnected from the world. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. There is a reference to the past: ""In the pas I tried to hide this,"" which appears to be a typo for ""In the past I tried to hide this,"" but it refers to hiding feelings, not a suicide attempt or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post states ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the mention of thinking about suicide implies a desire to not be alive, as it directly references suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates preparations like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide""), indicating present suicidal thoughts. The past reference is about hiding emotions, not past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""thinking about suicide everyday""), which fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves expressions of suicidal feelings without any specific plan or method. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of any plan or preparations. It is not 'Attempt' as there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post inquires about a painless way to die but does not detail any tools, locations, substances, or preparations. It remains general.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of any preparations like acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions of dying. It is not 'Behavior' because no plan is described, and it is not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""death is the only escape,"" and emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""Too far gone,"" ""The thoughts are intense and are seemingly only getting more intense,"" ""I wake immediately with suicidal thoughts,"" and ""There is no escape from the everlasting flames of life"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""death is the only escape.""
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing notes or acquiring items is indicated.
   - Since no plan is evident, this aligns with choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and ongoing intentions (e.g., ""The thoughts are intense and are seemingly only getting more intense,"" and ""I wake immediately with suicidal thoughts""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""death is the only escape""), but lacks any specific plan or method, which fits the definition of 'Ideation.'

34,"Zoloft overdose. So at 11:30 I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg and It obviously wasn't enough to kill me, I feel completely fine now apart from slight nausea and I'm really sweaty, will I be okay if I don't go to hospital?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions an overdose of Zoloft (6 pills, 300mg), which implies self-harm or an attempt to end life. It references death (""wasn't enough to kill me"") and includes physical symptoms (nausea, sweating). There are no clear emotional indicators like hopelessness, but the act suggests distress. Specific methods are mentioned (overdose with a substance and quantity), and it describes a concrete action taken.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of the overdose and the intent to ""kill me.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied by the action and statement about it not being enough to kill.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, Zoloft overdose with details on quantity and timing.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post describes the action already taken, which indicates preparation (e.g., acquiring and taking the pills).
   - Since a method and action are clearly described, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event (taking pills at 11:30) and current concerns (physical symptoms and seeking advice), but the core is a described action that has already occurred. No future plans are detailed, but it involves a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a concrete action (overdose) that happened in the past, fitting the 'Attempt' category, as it involves a historic suicidal action. It's not just thoughts ('Ideation') or planning without action ('Behavior'), and it explicitly details an attempt, so 'Attempt' is the best fit.

If youre attractive the world is literally your oyster, I would never stop smiling I was born that way. I would fucking jump out of bed every morning because at least I have that because appearance, which is totally determined by chance, is the thing that has by far the biggest difference in ones life. I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way'There's such an obsession with preventing people from the act of killing themselves but nobody really cares about everything leading up to that.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and despair about the user's own appearance, describing it as ""daily torture"" and being ""unwanted in literally all facets of life."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, such as wishing to have been born attractive and contrasting it with their reality. The post mentions ""the act of killing themselves"" in a general context, referring to society's obsession with suicide prevention, but this is not tied to the user's personal experiences. No mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm are directed at the user themselves. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in the phrase ""the act of killing themselves,"" but this is a general reference to others or society, not the user. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user expresses distress about life but does not state a personal desire to die or end their life.
   - Since this is unclear and not explicitly about the user, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but there's no evidence here to suggest even ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current feelings and general observations about life, with no reference to past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress and mentions suicide in a broad, non-personal context, but lacks any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings from the user. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as there is no direct indication of the user's own suicidal ideation, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions self-harm (""I just slit my wrists""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""I have been so distant,"" ""I am not a good person,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" ""I just want to get it over with""), specific plans and methods (looking at pictures and graphs of the radial artery, marking it, using a dremel with a saw attachment), and a sense of finality (""if you are seeing this then its already too late,"" ""Goodbye"").
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: Yes, explicitly describes slitting wrists and targeting an artery.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, isolation, and a desire to end life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, describes researching the artery, marking it, and using tools like a dremel.
   - References to past attempts: Indirectly references the decision process over years, but focuses on the current action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through descriptions of self-harm and wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""my death will only benefit people"" and ""I just want to get it over with.""
   - It is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, slitting wrists, using a dremel on the radial artery.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, researching and marking the artery.
   - This includes explicit planning and action, but the post describes the action as having occurred.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a very recent action (""I just slit my wrists"") and implies it's already done, making it a past attempt from the poster's perspective. It also mentions the decision process over years but focuses on the immediate event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes a concrete action that has just happened (slitting wrists with preparation), which fits the definition of 'Attempt' as it involves a historic action (even if very recent). It goes beyond ideation or behavior by narrating the completion of an attempt, and the rules specify to label as 'Attempt' if it refers to past attempts, which this does.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to both past events (e.g., ""I attempted suicide b4"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ""100% planning to kill myself"" and ""ticking time bomb"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts with specific plans and preparations, which aligns with 'behavior.' However, it also explicitly mentions a past suicide attempt (""I attempted suicide b4"").

No signs of preparations (e.g., acquiring a gun) or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" and ""urge to just blow my brains out."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user expresses a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" indicate a method involving a firearm. There are no signs of preparation like acquiring means, but the mention of a specific method qualifies as part of a plan. Since this is explicit, it leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and ongoing intentions, such as daily urges and thoughts at night, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (gun-related), which aligns with the 'behavior' category as it involves a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's regret over a failed relationship, self-hatred, family issues (mother dying from cancer and caring for an autistic brother), feelings of hopelessness, and references to past suicide struggles.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation?

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (hospitalization), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. While there are current suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to join the mother), no specific current plans are mentioned, so it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior'.

I feel unwanted and I don't have anywhere else to go, I can't tell if they hate me or I'm overthinking but all I know is that I'll never receive the attention or commitment that I give to anyone. I can't tell anyone how I'm actually feeling because I know that it would push them away and they couldn't help in the first place. I've always had a solution to my issues when I was younger, like putting a bandaid on a scratch or finding a way to get out of detention. Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide. You can't fix that shit.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme distress, hopelessness, and misery, such as ""Fuck life, I'm out,"" feelings of being unwanted, lack of motivation, and overthinking leading to poor performance. There is an explicit mention of ""the thought of suicide."" Emotional indicators include despair, pain, and a sense of no solutions. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""the thought of suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""Fuck life, I'm out"" and the implication of wanting to end the suffering.
   - This is clear, so it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and thoughts, not past events. It's about ongoing struggles and present suicidal thoughts, with no description of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""the thought of suicide""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there's no reference to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of paranoid delusions, a wish for them to come true (e.g., being killed by a neighbor), and a direct reference to suicide with the phrase ""do myself in,"" which means to kill oneself. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and self-deprecation, such as feeling like a coward, crying, and describing oneself as ugly. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""try to do myself in,"" which is a clear idiom for attempting suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a desire for death via wishing to be murdered as an easier option, implying a wish to end their life.
   - This is not unclear, so it leans toward explicit mention.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward carrying out a plan.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current thoughts and feelings, not past events or future intentions with specific planning. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""do myself in"" and wishing for death), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

47,I thought I was getting better. for the past few weeks I've been happy just to be spending time with my partner without any bad days. I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again. I've run out of meds and I asked for an urgent refill a few days ago but my doctors/pharmacy never got back to me. I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user's recent improvement in mood, sudden return of suicidal feelings, running out of medications, difficulty getting a refill, and concerns about impacting their partner. There are mentions of suicide (""I'm suicidal again"") and emotional indicators like low mood, hopelessness, and fear of stressing others. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I'm suicidal again.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as ""I'm suicidal again"" implies a desire for self-harm or ending life.
   - This is clear, so it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, mentioning running out of meds is related to treatment, not preparation for suicide (e.g., no suicide notes or acquiring lethal items).
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings (""I'm suicidal again"") and recent events (past few weeks of improvement, running out of meds), with no mention of past attempts or future intentions beyond the current state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal again""), which rules out 'Indicator'. There is no specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. It is not about past attempts, so 'Attempt' does not apply. Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal feelings without a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""My life has been getting worse,"" ""I'm so lonely I can't go on anymore,"" ""I fucked up my life,"" and ""I miss being happy."" There is a mention of death or dying through the phrase ""end it,"" which implies suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include loneliness, addiction, and regret. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed, though being drunk is mentioned as a current state. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""end it"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""then end it"" indicate a desire to end one's life. Since this is not unclear, it leans toward explicit suicidal expression rather than just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or means beyond being drunk in the basement. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as writing a note or acquiring items; the post only vaguely references ""tonight... then end it,"" which suggests timing but not a concrete plan. If uncertain, I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' so this does not qualify as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., long-term addiction and a mistake), but the critical elements focus on current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it""). No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to end it), fitting the definition of 'Ideation,' as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It goes beyond general distress (which would be 'Indicator') but does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' due to the lack of explicit planning. There are no past attempts, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of worthlessness, hopelessness, and a desire to disappear or die soon. There are mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""I'm gonna die soon,"" ""If I died no one would truly miss me""), emotional indicators of despair (e.g., no future goals, no motivation, feeling worthless), and general dissatisfaction with life. However, there are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not use the word ""suicide"" or directly state an intent to end one's life; it implies a desire to die through phrases like ""disappear"" or ""gonna die soon.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly (e.g., ""no reason to live,"" ""might as well disappear""), but these are not explicit mentions of suicide. Since it's unclear and not direct, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but since no plan is mentioned at all, this doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and future predictions (e.g., ""gonna die soon""), with no description of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and vague thoughts about dying, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to end one's life directly. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation.' There are no plans or past attempts, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' do not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of overwhelming distress, hopelessness, isolation, bullying, unsupportive family, and a desire for relief. There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically in the line ""Honestly, I hope I kill myself soon. It's for the best, anyways."" Emotional indicators include despair, lack of energy, and a sense of unending suffering. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no clear references to past attempts, though there's a vague hint in ""I refuse to make that mistake again,"" which could imply past burdens but not explicitly suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I hope I kill myself soon.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as evidenced by the hope to end their life and statements about suffering until death.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plans.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this aligns more with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to current feelings and future hopes (e.g., ""I hope I kill myself soon""), rather than past events. The vague reference to ""that mistake again"" might suggest something in the past, but it's not a description of a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., hoping to kill oneself), which fits the definition of Ideation. There is no specific plan or method, so it doesn't qualify as Behavior. It's not merely general distress without explicit suicide mentions, so it's not Indicator. There's no clear description of a past attempt, so it's not Attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include references to jumping off, specifically from a bedroom window, with details about trees and mud below making it less scary. This implies a method involving height and falling. Emotional indicators include gaining courage and a hope to do it soon, suggesting determination and possible despair. There are no direct mentions of death or suicide words, but the context implies self-harm. Specific plans or methods are mentioned (jumping from the window), and there are signs of mental preparation (gaining courage). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post expresses intent to jump, which implies a desire to end life.
   - Since there's an implication of wanting to die, but not explicit, I would lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the context moves beyond vague expressions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, jumping from the bedroom window is specified, with details about the environment (trees and mud), indicating a location and method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post mentions gaining courage, which could be seen as mental preparation for the act.
   - If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, the plan is clear enough to qualify as explicit.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""I think I can jump off,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to jump) and mentions a specific plan (jumping from the bedroom window with environmental details). This aligns with 'Behavior' as it involves a plan, per the definition. It's not 'Indicator' due to the implied desire and plan, not 'Ideation' because of the specific method, and not 'Attempt' as it's not about past actions.

No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as ""want to disappear"" is vague and metaphorical, not a direct indication of suicidal thoughts. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no mention of any plan, so if it were to be considered further, it would not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or a plan.

There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, such as the belief that ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped,"" suggesting resignation and a lack of expectation for intervention.

School has been so hard, I can\'t focus and the smallest things annoy me. Exampel; I sit by myself near the front of my science class cause I have no friends, one lesson a teacher sat next to me to work with another kid and she wouldnt stop tapping her leg. I, It annoyed me so much i couldnt focus and started ripping my page up with my pen and not doung work for the rest of the lesson. had a hass test and my neck, back and chest hurt and i got mad so i started leaninng against the desk as hard as i could to hurt my chest i couldnt do the wuiz and flunked it lurposley; even though i understanded some of the questions i didnt answer correctly. I wasnt always this angry but lately the littlest things make me so mad, when I cant move a tab on google so i can have two things open at once makes me want to hit the computer, my dad breathing loudly all the time, people shiffting their hands on their clothes and making noise pisses me off, mum and dad singing irritates  me plus they suck at it, ect. I hide in the toilets at school half the time, the no phone rule is shit, my phone is my safe space and break from reality and I cant even drown out those filthy fucking freaks with music. My classmates are racist, ableist and homophobic, they say slurs and everything. They say them so fucking loudly but what does the teacher do? NOTHING THEY FUCKING IGNORE IT WHAT THE FUCK, THIS IS WHY KIDS KILL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE TEACHERS LET THE ONLY DECENT CHILDREN BE SURROUNDED BY THESE FREAKS. Schoo is the main reason i want to kill myself its awfull, I\'m tired of people telling me to just ""push through it"" I understand thats the only option but i dont want to accept that, I want to be happy and learn not memorize things so I cant forget them. I\'m 13 and in year 9 and everything wer elearning is scary and I dont want to learn it because I dont need to use it. They get mad at me for not focusing when they teach the mist boring shit. I\'m so scared I\'m so scared I dont want ro kill myself but im so scated im going to act on my thoughts I dont want to die but I dont want to go to school. Does anyone relate? One last thing; I had a huge fallout with my ""dad"" because one night When i was about to go to sleep I heard  heavy breathing, it scared the shit out of me and rightfully so. I remembered the laundry door was unlocked so i got up to lock it, my dad woke up and asked what i was doing. I started bursting out in tears because I seriously thought i was goinng to die that night, he says its nothing and then i just go back to my room. Then he gets mad at me because im sitting up on my bed, like xcuse me? Im not going to go to bed immediately i just heard scary shit and burst out crying, i tokd him to shut up and go away because i was already mad at him from previous incidents. I sat for maybe anothee minute then dad comes outs, i had my flashlight on and dad thought i was in my ohone? Idk it was obvious i wasnt. He got really mad at me and tried to snatch my ohone away, he moved really fast and he was really scaring me. I took it before he could grab it and then he wouldnt leave me alone.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts, such as ""I want to kill myself,"" ""struggling with suicidal thoughts,"" and ""scared I'm going to act on my thoughts."" Emotional indicators include fear, hopelessness, anger, and distress related to school, family issues, and daily annoyances. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor any references to past suicide attempts. The post focuses on current struggles and fears.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I want to kill myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., expressions of fear of acting on thoughts and wanting to end life due to school and family issues).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is detailed, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current and potential future intentions (e.g., fear of acting on thoughts), not past events. While there are descriptions of past incidents like the fallout with the dad, these are not related to suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past attempts are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post includes key elements such as expressions of extreme hopelessness, despair, and emotional distress (e.g., ""rock bottom,"" ""darkness everywhere,"" ""crying helplessly,"" ""guilt and memories""). It mentions self-harm and suicide-related thoughts, including specific methods like ""stab my head or slit my neck."" There are references to wanting to die (""I should have died way back then,"" ""I want to go away""), past missed opportunities for death, and ongoing suffering from flashbacks, but no clear descriptions of actual preparations or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""end it myself"" and expressions of wanting to die. There are direct desires to not be alive, such as ""I should have died way back then when I had the chance.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including ""stab my head or slit my neck,"" which are ways to commit suicide. There are no signs of preparations like acquiring tools or writing a note, but the mention of specific methods qualifies as explicit ideas of how to end one's life.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., ""flashback of those horrible memories,"" ""I should have died way back then"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing distress and thoughts of self-harm), but it does not describe a concrete past suicide attempt, only missed opportunities.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific methods for suicide (e.g., stabbing or slitting), which aligns with the 'behavior' category as it involves expressions of suicidal feelings plus specific ideas of how to commit suicide. Although there are no indications of active preparations, the presence of methods pushes it to 'behavior' rather than 'ideation' based on the definitions.

58,"It's never a good idea to threaten to call the cops on someone who's passive suicidal, teetering on the edge of being suicidal. Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""passive suicidal,"" ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal,"" and ""suicide by cop."" It discusses suicide in a general or hypothetical context, but there are no emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair directly from the poster. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described for the poster themselves, and there are no references to past attempts by the poster.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""suicide by cop."" However, this is not a direct expression of the poster's own wanting to die; it's referenced in a third-person or advisory context. Since the post is not about the poster's personal thoughts or feelings, and the rules specify focusing on the person writing the post, this does not qualify as an explicit mention for the poster.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (""suicide by cop""), but these are not attributed to the poster or described as their own plans. There are no signs of preparation by the poster. Since nothing indicates the poster's involvement, this does not meet the criteria for planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to hypothetical or general situations (e.g., what might happen to someone else), not past events, current intentions, or future plans of the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post discusses suicide in an abstract, advisory manner without any explicit expressions of the poster's own suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts. Based on the rules, the risk must pertain to the person writing the post, and here there is no indication of that. Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks direct suicidal expressions from the poster.

59,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include multiple references to near-death experiences, explicit descriptions of past suicide attempts, and expressions of not wanting to live. Mentions of death, dying, and suicide are present, such as ""suicide attempts,"" swallowing pills, slicing the neck, and taking prescriptions. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to live at all"") and confusion about surviving. Specific plans and methods are detailed, like buying Unisom pills, writing a suicide note, using a straight razor, and consuming prescriptions. References to past attempts are clear, including events at age 16 and in November 2020.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I don't want to live at all"" and direct references to ""suicide attempts.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as Unisom pills, a straight razor, and prescriptions, along with preparations like buying pills and writing a note. This indicates explicit planning in the described events.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events, including suicide attempts at age 16 and in November 2020, as well as a recent accident. There are no indications of current or future intentions, focusing instead on historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts with concrete actions (e.g., swallowing pills and going to the hospital), which aligns with the ""Attempt"" category. While there is a current expression of not wanting to live, the dominant content is about historical attempts, not ongoing plans or ideation alone.

Here I am yet again the same loser who would never make it out of this treacherous pit. I\'ve been trying to push myself to kill myself for the last few weeks. Tgere were moments of ups and downs. But I just cant. I chicken out like I did in almost everything in life. \n\nI\'m almost 30 years old for fuck sake. I don\'t have a job coz I am so stressed to work in the fucking accounting and auditing field I have knowledge about. I am ""trying"" to get a job for the sake of my grandma eho us worried sick of me. My parents are still trusting my sorry ass that I would find a job and get martied snd ""live happily ever after"". How can I tell them that I have let them down?\n\n The rest of my family have lost hope in me. I have had warnings and serious advices from all family members to get my act straight. I\'ve been called a laxy bum by my relatives. My brother calls me a selfish guy as I am living on other people\'s money and almost disowned me. I know he didn\'t and I wish he did. \n\nI don\'t mean to sit on my ass and play township all day eating sleeping and shitting forever. I wish I could be on my own. But the thought of life scares me. I hate the field I\'m semi qualified for. I fucked up the final exams after wasting an year including the lockdown and postponement of exams last year. I tried to find a way out of this field but all my ""unrealistic"" ideas didn\'t seem to work. I thought I could become a part time teacher as I always liked to teach. But my brother who is a very successful and know it all genius of the family pointed out that teachers are already jobless and I am a stupid idiot who would fail his students as he can\'t even get himself to pass an exam. I can\'t become a writer coz that requires some intelligence which I don\'t have. I can\'t run a business of my own as I am broke and I would fail that too. I can\'t do anything else. I am stuck and keep going down this quicksand pit. \n\nEven if I suck it up and get a job in the audit field, what am I gonna do? I would be replaced by someon who is actually resourceful in a matter of no time. Even if I become good in my job, what next? Work for 60 hours a week for the next 30 years on something that drives me crazy? Get married for the sake of family? Get a bunch of kids snd add their well being and education into the list of my ever expanding troubles? Make connections with people I don\'t like for the sake of social status? Why is that life for anyway? \n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? Everyone else seems to be enjoying this godforsaken way of life that has sslaved us to our luxuries and  social status. Why can\'t I suck it up and become a zombie and do whatever I\'m told to? Why is my brain not able to get the message? \n\nI have been noticed by teachers and friends to have signs of ADHD sibce school days. But my family who don\'t believe in mental illness knows better. They know that I\'m a lazy awkward idiot who didn\'t learn to focus his thoughts and is still immature and can\'t handle being a MAN as my brother is. \n\nI know there\'s a million quotes about ""we can live the life we want and nobody can stop us"" or ""Work hard and be successful"" shit. But whst is the point in all of that if I ultimately despise the fucking life itself?\n\nWhat is the point to anything? Am I in hell? Is this the way I get tortured for eternity? I got molested by my aunt\'s sister when I was 7 and my  brother when I was 8. Both of them were also underage during that time. So they dropped their load on me. At least I didn\'t molest anyone to satisfy my curiosity. I just learned masturbation when I was 10 and did it like 4 times a day until I turned 25. I developed a craving for pleasure even before I knew what it is. I am still suffering fighting hard to control my thoughts. \n\nI dropped out of school when I was 13 and put back in school at 19. Worked my way through without thinking about what I really want and went on with what my family thought would be good for my future. Well that\'s what you get being born in a dysfunctional family and having mental illness. I am suffering from depression and anxiety for the last 6 years. Well everyone else thinks that I\'m lazy and moody. Maybe that is what i am. \n\nI am a useless piece of garbage. No even garbage can be recycled or turned into manure or something. I am just a waste of a life being a burden on everyone adding carbon dioxide to the earth. \n\nI have tried several times to take myself out the last few weeks. Hanging myself, drowning myself, falling from the 3rd floor on to the road below, hanging again. But. i just can\'t go through it. I can\'t live, I can\'t die. Story of my life is nothing but waste of time and resources. \n\nI wish I could just go through it. A few seconds of pain is enough. I would dir and the world would be a better place.\n\nFor fuck sake give me a heart attack or something. Haven\'t I had enough? What more fucked up shit is shead for me?\n\nHindu mythology says hell is filled with torture methods like boiling pas of oil and fire to torture the bad people. I used to believe that.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include multiple mentions of death, dying, and suicide, such as ""I know I should die,"" ""I've been trying to push myself to kill myself,"" and explicit references to self-harm methods like ""Hanging myself, drowning myself, falling from the 3rd floor."" Emotional indicators show extreme hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, and worthlessness, e.g., ""I am a useless piece of garbage"" and ""I WISH I NEVER EXISTED."" Specific plans or methods are mentioned, including attempts at hanging, drowning, and jumping. References to past attempts are present, such as ""I have tried several times to take myself out the last few weeks.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""take myself out"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I wish I could just go through it,"" ""I WISH I NEVER EXISTED"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (hanging, drowning, falling from the 3rd floor).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Indirectly implied through descriptions of attempts, but not explicitly detailed (e.g., no mention of acquiring tools or writing a note). Since methods are specified and attempts are referenced, this leans toward 'behavior' or 'attempt,' but I must consider the overall context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""I have tried several times the last few weeks"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I could feel myself getting ready to go through it every passing moment""). Past attempts are specifically described, such as the methods tried recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and references to past attempts (e.g., trying to hang or drown). According to the definitions, 'Attempt' applies when content describes past attempts, and even if current plans are mentioned, it still falls under 'Attempt.' There are no indications of only vague thoughts (which would be 'Ideation') or just general distress without explicit suicide mentions (which would be 'Indicator'). Thus, 'Attempt' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include a wish for a catastrophic event (meteor hitting Earth) to kill everyone, including the poster, which implies a desire for death. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as hating all human beings and specifically blaming family for ""forcing me to live."" No mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations are present. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or direct self-inflicted death is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? There is an indirect expression through hoping for an external event to cause death, but it's not a direct personal desire to end one's own life. Since this is unclear and not explicit, lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the meteor is an external, uncontrollable event, not a personal method or plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? None.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's no indication of any plan, so it doesn't reach ideation level based on explicitness.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a future hypothetical event (meteor hitting), indicating current feelings of despair rather than past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and a vague desire for death via an external means, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or self-inflicted harm. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, 'indicator' should be chosen over 'ideation'. There are no plans, behaviors, or past attempts mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and dissatisfaction with life, such as being 29 and still living with parents, a string of seemingly random or gibberish text that includes possible misspellings or repetitions like ""fuckkkkkkkk"" indicating anger, and a clear statement of hating coding. There are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The gibberish text might contain something resembling ""die"" (e.g., ""didie""), but it is embedded in nonsensical strings and not clearly intentional. Emotional indicators suggest general unhappiness and frustration, but nothing explicitly points to hopelessness or despair related to suicide. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the gibberish might vaguely hint at ""die,"" it is not direct or clear. Since it is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but there's no evidence here to even reach that level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post appears to refer to current feelings of dissatisfaction, with no indication of past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general expressions of distress and frustration but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, thoughts of dying, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal expressions, and any vague elements are not sufficient to classify it higher. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of frustration, stress, anxiety, and feelings of being mocked and abused by Z and at home. The user mentions, ""i feel like he would be better off without me,"" which vaguely hints at their own absence but does not explicitly refer to death or suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, isolation, and despair, as seen in phrases like ""i am so sick of this endless myopic bouts of 'criticism'"" and ""if i leave them i have no one."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

My mind is going crazy and all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat. I feel incredibly overwhelmed and don't know what to do. Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide (""I was already suicidal and depressed""), self-harm (""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat""), and emotional indicators such as feeling terrible, overwhelmed, and unable to cry. There are no references to past attempts, but there is a clear expression of current distress and a specific method of self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through phrases like ""I feel so bad,"" ""My mind is going crazy,"" and ""I can't even cry.""
   - Specific plans or methods: The post mentions ""cutting my god damn throat,"" which is a specific method of suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None are described; the reference to being ""already suicidal and depressed"" is about a state, not an action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I was already suicidal and depressed.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as indicated by the desire to ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat,"" which expresses a wish to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cutting my god damn throat"" refers to a specific method (self-inflicted cutting with a sharp object).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring tools or writing a note, but the mention of a specific method qualifies as part of planning.
   - Since a specific method is described, this aligns with the criteria for 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I feel so bad,"" ""all I want to do is...""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat""), which meets the definition of 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning (specific method). It goes beyond mere ideation, which lacks a plan, and does not describe a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

65,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions thoughts of suicide, plotting suicide, drafting a will, feelings of obligation, shame, guilt, and emotional distress like hopelessness, tiredness, and feeling different or weak. There are references to suicide explicitly, emotional indicators of despair, and some indications of preparation like drafting a will. No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) are detailed, but plotting and the will suggest planning. No past attempts are referenced.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., feelings of obligation to suicide, not wanting to live).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods like tools or locations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, drafting a will is mentioned as a preparation step.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. However, drafting a will qualifies as explicit preparation under the definition, so this leans toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to ongoing and recent events (e.g., plotting for months, drafting a will yesterday) rather than past attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of desire to die, plus preparations like drafting a will, which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves explicit planning/preparations. It's not just ideation since preparations are evident, and it's not an attempt as no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme tiredness, lack of motivation, feelings of sickness, loneliness, jealousy, financial struggles, and regret over interpersonal issues. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""i'm always tired,"" ""life is so cyclic,"" ""it's so lonely,"" and ""i don't have enough money."" The phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" might vaguely suggest ending something, possibly life, but it does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""i'm ready to get this over with soon"" is ambiguous and could imply a desire to end life, it is not a direct expression. Following the guidance, if unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no evidence of planning, if it were to be considered for a higher category, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if applicable, but it's not based on the above.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers primarily to current feelings and possible future intentions (e.g., ""i'm ready to get this over with soon""), but these are vague and not explicitly suicidal. There are no descriptions of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and vague dissatisfaction with life, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts expressed, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of distress related to gender dysphoria, sexual orientation, childhood trauma (molestation), loneliness, depression, and anxiety. There are mentions of suicide, such as ""i think about suicide all the time"" and ""i always think about ending it."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a desire for change, as seen in phrases like ""i caint take it anymore,"" ""am just tired of living so unhappy,"" and ""i dont see a future for me anymore."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. References to past events include childhood molestation and ongoing thoughts of suicide since age 9, but no explicit past attempts are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""i think about suicide all the time"" and ""i always think about ending it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through expressions of ongoing suicidal thoughts and statements indicating no future, such as ""i dont see a future for me anymore.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is indicated.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., childhood experiences) and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing thoughts of suicide). However, it focuses on persistent thoughts rather than any specific past attempts or future plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of ""Ideation."" It is not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not ""Behavior"" due to the absence of planning. It is not ""Attempt"" as no past actions are described.

They consume the news and stuff of the media making themselves ignorant to the basic fact that human life has no fucking purpose other than living as a slave to make the rich richer and to slowly decay. We start dying the second we are born. This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good. So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post expresses extreme anger, frustration, and hopelessness about life, society, government, and the meaninglessness of existence. Key elements include mentions of ""rotting away,"" ""we start dying the second we are born,"" and a direct statement about taking a trip in April to end it all. There are emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness, but no explicit mentions of specific methods like tools or substances. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with the word ""suicide,"" but there are direct expressions of wanting to end life, such as ""to end this bullshit for good,"" which implies a desire to die. This is not entirely unclear, so it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: There is a mention of a specific plan: ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" This indicates a future action tied to ending life, suggesting preparation or intent, though no explicit methods (e.g., tools or locations) are detailed. Since this constitutes a plan, it leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers primarily to current feelings and future intentions (the trip in April), with no description of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (the trip in April to end life), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the planned action, even if methods are not detailed.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""nearly killing myself/shooting up the school,"" which references suicide and potential self-harm. Emotional indicators include expressions of hatred toward life, feeling like ""rotting away,"" and general hopelessness about bullies getting away with it. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for current actions. References to past attempts are present in ""nearly killing myself,"" suggesting a past near-event but not a completed one.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I fucking hate living"" and the implication in ""nearly killing myself.""
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""shooting up the school"" implies a method (e.g., using a weapon), but it's in the context of a past event, not current. There are no signs of preparation for future actions.
   - Since this is not about explicit current planning, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' if uncertain, this fits ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events (""nearly killing myself""), with current expressions of distress, but no indications of future intentions. No confirmed past attempts are described, only something that was nearly done.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., hating living and past near-suicide), but lacks any mention of a current specific plan or preparation, making 'ideation' the best fit. It's not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'behavior' without current plans, and not 'attempt' as no concrete past action is confirmed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include multiple mentions of death and dying, such as ""something inside of me is telling me to die,"" ""I want to die,"" ""makes me want to die,"" and ""Is hanging 100% effective. As in if I try hard enough, I can die."" There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""I've been through too much,"" ""I want to give up,"" and ""I'm already screwed for the rest of my life."" Self-harm is referenced indirectly with ""I hurt my voice the other day screaming"" and ""I want to scream until I lose my voice."" A specific method is mentioned with ""Is hanging 100% effective,"" which implies a potential plan. No clear references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I want to die"" and the direct inquiry about hanging.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, evident in multiple statements expressing a desire to die or rest eternally.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging is specifically referenced as a potential method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, as it's more of an inquiry rather than described actions like acquiring means, but the mention of a method (hanging) indicates a specific idea.
   - Based on the definitions, since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This primarily refers to current and future intentions, such as ongoing desires to die and the question about hanging's effectiveness. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, though minor self-harm (e.g., screaming to hurt the voice) is mentioned as a past event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings, which could suggest 'ideation.' However, it also mentions a specific method (hanging), which per the definitions pushes it into 'behavior.' There are no past attempts described, so 'attempt' doesn't apply. It's not just general distress, as suicide is explicitly referenced, ruling out 'indicator.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of temptation to end one's life, specifically by jumping from a high place (""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground""). There are mentions of death and dying, as indicated by references to becoming a ""corpse"" or ending up ""crippled."" Emotional indicators include guilt, fear, and internal conflict about the impact on others left behind. There are no references to past attempts or specific preparations like acquiring tools.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with the word ""suicide,"" but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as the desire to ""plummet to the ground"" and references to becoming a ""corpse."" This constitutes an implicit but clear indication of suicidal intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: A specific method is mentioned: jumping from the highest floor. This describes a potential location and action, which qualifies as a specific plan. There are no signs of further preparations, but the mention of a method is sufficient to consider this as planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current temptations and future intentions (e.g., ""so tempted to just go""), rather than past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts along with a specific method (jumping from a high floor), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a plan, so 'Behavior' is the best fit. If there were no specific method, it might lean toward 'Ideation,' but the instructions specify to choose 'Behavior' if a method is mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a plea for a hug and a desire for pain to go away. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include distress or sadness related to pain, but nothing explicitly pointing to hopelessness or despair beyond a general wish for relief. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire for pain to end, which could imply emotional relief but does not clearly indicate suicidal thoughts. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or means, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's not even at the level of ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings (wanting a hug now to alleviate pain), not past events or future intentions. There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general distress and a desire for pain to go away but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, death, or plans. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it involves expressions of sadness without direct suicidal references. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in the post are expressions of frustration and a desire to die, as seen in phrases like ""Screw this,"" ""The more I live the more I want to die,"" and ""Can't be fucked with anything anymore."" There are mentions of wanting to die, which relates to death, but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the phrase ""the more I live the more I want to die."" Although not explicitly stating ""suicide,"" this is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts, so it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no mention of plans, methods, or preparations, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions, as it is in the present tense (""The more I live""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (""want to die""), which fits the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan, so it is not behavior. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction, as it directly indicates suicidal thoughts, making it more than just an indicator. Therefore, the best category is ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include multiple mentions of death, dying, and suicide (e.g., ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I want to kill myself tonight,"" ""been actively suicidal""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""it won't get better,"" ""I'm going to feel like this forever""). Specific plans and methods are mentioned (e.g., ""I'll down all my Xanax and Effexor,"" ""slice my wrists open,"" ""throw myself into traffic""). References to past attempts include ""I tried cutting myself but it didn't work"" and ""I've done it before.""
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I just want to die,"" ""I don't want to be alive anymore"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., pills like Paracetamol, Xanax, and Effexor; cutting with blades; throwing into traffic).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., has pills saved up, plans to get new blades, ties suicide to a specific event like obtaining a game character).
   - Since specific plans and preparations are present, this indicates behavior, but we must consider the overall context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., past suicidal thoughts since age 5, tried cutting before) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to kill myself tonight,"" ""once I get the character, I'm giving my account to my friend and killing myself"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts with specific plans, which could suggest 'behavior'. However, it also describes past attempts (e.g., ""I tried cutting myself""), and according to the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'. Therefore, 'attempt' is the best fit.

75,It will all be done after I die. I want to die because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color I'm just going to pull the trigger if a cop doesn't do it first.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and dying (""It will all be done after I die,"" ""I want to die""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and distress due to pressure from skin color, and a specific plan (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""). There are no references to self-harm beyond the plan or past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die""). This leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes.
   - Since the expressions are direct about wanting to die, it goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pull the trigger"" implies using a gun as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as acquiring means or writing a note.
   - There is a clear mention of a specific method, so this indicates planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die (suicidal thoughts) and mentions a specific method (""pull the trigger""), which qualifies as a plan. This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it involves both thoughts and an explicit plan without evidence of a past attempt. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to the direct expressions, nor 'Ideation' because of the plan, nor 'Attempt' as it's not about past actions.

Only a matter of when.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include feelings of loneliness from a friend not communicating for over six months, being bailed on, inability to express emotions, abuse from job and parents, and an explicit statement ""I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when."" 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, with the direct phrase ""I'm going to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, loneliness, and tiredness are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned; it only implies a future action without details.
   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with ""I'm going to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the statement expresses a desire to end life.
   - The mention is clear and explicit, so this moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only a vague indication of timing (""Only a matter of when"") without any concrete steps.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions, as indicated by ""I'm going to kill myself,"" with no description of past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'ideation.' It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as there's no reference to past actions.

77,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol'You're here because of something.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a question about the lethality of a combination of substances: Midol (3 bottles), Prozac (30 20mg pills), Tylenol (one bottle), and a water bottle full of alcohol. There are mentions of death through the implied overdose, as the user asks if this would kill them. Emotional indicators are minimal, but the inquiry suggests desperation or curiosity about self-harm. Specific plans or methods are referenced through the detailed list of substances, which could be used for overdose. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, but the question ""Would this kill me"" implies consideration of death. Since it's not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines, but I must also consider the presence of methods.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including substances like Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, and alcohol, which are potential means for overdose. This could indicate preparation, as the user is listing items in detail. However, if uncertain about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Given the definitions, the mention of specific means pushes this toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or potential future intentions, as the user is inquiring about the effects now. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post does not have explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a plan (which would be 'ideation'), but it includes specific ideas of how to commit suicide through the listed substances, per the Ideation definition's qualifier. Therefore, it fits 'behavior' as it mentions explicit planning elements. Although suicide isn't directly stated, the presence of methods overrides leaning toward 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of severe anxiety, hopelessness, and distress, such as fainting episodes, disturbed sleep, hallucinations, and feelings of confusion and terror. There are direct mentions of death and dying, like ""be better off dead,"" ""Let it be over,"" ""just want it over and done with,"" and specific references to suicide methods such as ""find the tallest thing and jump or just run in front of a train,"" ""Got pills to take if it gets too much,"" and ""I don't know when or how but its going to have to happen soon."" Emotional indicators include despair, exhaustion, and a sense of inevitability about ending life. There are signs of specific plans (e.g., jumping, train, pills) and preparations (e.g., having pills). No clear references to past attempts are present; it's more focused on current and future intentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""be better off dead,"" ""end it,"" ""the obvious,"" implying suicide). 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I can't live like this anymore,"" ""Just want it over and done with one way or another"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., jumping from a tall thing, running in front of a train, taking pills for overdose). 
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., ""Got pills to take if it gets too much,"" and statements about it happening soon). 
   - Since specific methods and preparations are described, this indicates planning beyond just thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This primarily refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""gonna have to happen soon,"" ""I don't know when or how but its going to have to happen soon""). There are vague references to past thoughts (e.g., ""I thought I would end it a while ago""), but no description of actual past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and direct mentions of specific plans (methods like jumping, train, and pills, with preparations noted). This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it goes beyond ideation by including explicit planning. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' because of the specific plans, and not 'Attempt' since no past concrete actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include references to past suicidal thoughts, such as setting a date for suicide, writing letters, and having a set plan. There are mentions of death and suicide (""killing myself,"" ""set plan""), emotional indicators of past pain and desperation (e.g., ""extraordinarily painful,"" ""desperate""), and signs of preparation (e.g., letters written, set date). No current self-harm or ongoing plans are indicated.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""set plan"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in reference to past intentions (e.g., setting a date).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not in detail, but there are signs of preparation, such as writing letters and having a set plan, which implies a method was considered.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., letters written, set date, days away from execution).
   - Since there is clear mention of a plan and preparation, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to past events (e.g., ""I came extraordinarily close,"" ""letters were written,"" ""days away from going through with""). No current or future intentions are described; instead, the post emphasizes a decision to live now.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific plan with preparations, which aligns with 'behavior'. It does not describe an actual past attempt (no concrete action occurred), so it's not 'attempt'. It's not 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, and it's not just 'ideation' because a plan is detailed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include repeated expressions of wanting to ""check out,"" which is a euphemism for dying or suicide. The word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as running on ""shear spite,"" holding on for so long, and realizing that even spite has limits. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly uses the word ""suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I really want to check out"" and ""how much I want to check out"" indicate a desire to end one's life.
   - Since it is explicit, no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since there is no indication of a plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., wanting to check out now), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die and no moral issue with suicide, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions an ""extreme impulse to slit my wrists,"" which is a direct reference to self-harm. It also includes emotional indicators like ongoing impulses ""all night,"" frustration (""what the fuck""), and expressions of hopelessness (""I can still win my mental health battles but I am definitely losing the war. and it is slowly destroying me""). There are no mentions of death or dying explicitly, but self-harm is implied as a method. No specific plans beyond the impulse, no preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, it's an impulse to self-harm, but the user states they are resisting it (""I refuse to and my resolve not to is winning""). Since it's not clearly explicit about wanting to die, I lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the self-harm mention complicates this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slit my wrists"" specifies a method (self-harm via cutting). There are no signs of preparation like acquiring tools or writing a note. However, the presence of a specific method means this could indicate planning, so I must choose 'ideation' if uncertain, but the definition for 'behavior' includes mentioning specific methods.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current impulses (""currently having an extreme impulse"" and ""it has been going on all night""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts through the impulse to self-harm and mentions a specific method (""slit my wrists""), which aligns with 'behavior' as per the definition (explicit thoughts plus a specific method). It's not just general distress, so not 'indicator'. It's not purely thoughts without a method, so not 'ideation'. There's no past attempt, so not 'attempt'. Therefore, 'behavior' fits best.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up,"" apologies to others, and a farewell message to family members. There are indirect references to death through phrases like ""The end is the only thing that feels right now,"" which implies a desire for ending one's life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" directly expresses a desire for death or to no longer exist.
   - Since this is an explicit expression of wanting to die, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as it goes beyond general dissatisfaction.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates planning or acquisition of means.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of serious thoughts about suicide, researching ways to kill oneself, family conflicts (e.g., fights with mom, perceived unfair treatment), emotional distress from social anxiety and seasonal depression, and self-doubt about faking depression.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: Yes, the user explicitly discusses ""thoughts about suicide,"" ""want to commit suicide,"" and researching ""easy painless ways to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, anger, self-doubt, and feelings of being triggered by family issues.

   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - The mentions are clear, so this goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as writing a note or acquiring means; it's more about ideation than action.
   - Since there's no clear explicit plan, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure, this leans toward ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past thoughts (e.g., in February) and current ongoing feelings, but it's focused on present ideation rather than past attempts or future-specific intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>

   - References to past attempts: Yes, the user states they have attempted suicide in the past.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user discusses suicidal thoughts and a past attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through references to current suicidal thoughts.
   - The mentions are clear, so this leans toward a category beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is indicated, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; it aligns more with 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a past attempt (historic) but also describes current suicidal thoughts without indicating future intentions or plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, but the post's main focus is on current thoughts and seeking help, not dwelling on the past.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I've begun having those thoughts again""), which fits 'ideation' as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide mentions. It is not 'behavior' because no preparations or methods are described. It is not 'attempt' as the primary content is about current thoughts, not solely or additionally about current plans alongside the past attempt.

86,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include a detailed description of overdosing on pills as a method of suicide, emphasizing its painful effects, such as liver damage, vomiting, and regret. It mentions death and dying explicitly in the context of suicide methods. Emotional indicators are present in the advisory tone, expressing concern and deterrence, but these are directed at someone else, not the writer. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations described for the writer themselves. No references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly references ""commit suicide"" and describes overdosing as a way to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the writer is not expressing their own desires; instead, they are warning or advising another person.
   - Since the mentions are not about the writer's own thoughts or feelings, and the rules specify that suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, this leans toward not qualifying as explicit for the writer.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, overdosing on pills is detailed with effects like liver failure.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the description is informational and not tied to the writer's actions or intentions.
   - For the writer, there is no indication of any plan, so this does not elevate to 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to general or hypothetical scenarios about overdosing, not past events or current/future intentions of the writer. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post discusses suicide explicitly but does not express any suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts from the writer's perspective. It is advisory toward others, so there is no indication of the writer's own risk. Based on the definitions, this lacks explicit expressions concerning the writer's suicide, making it best categorized as 'Indicator'. When in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over other categories, as per the rules.

87,"I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic""No one will care when I'm gone.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress, such as feelings of weakness, betrayal, embarrassment, and being used by friends. There are mentions of interpersonal conflicts, like a best friend dating the user's ex and an ultimatum given. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and a sense of isolation, as seen in phrases like ""I'm pathetic"" and ""all I'm doing is embarrassing myself."" There is a vague reference to ""No one will care when I'm gone,"" which could imply thoughts about death or absence, but there are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""No one will care when I'm gone"" is a vague statement that might hint at feelings of worthlessness or potential absence. Since it's not explicit and could be interpreted in non-suicidal ways, I lean toward 'indicator' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. The post does not describe any plans, tools, locations, or preparations related to suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and recent events, such as the ultimatum given last week and ongoing feelings of distress. There are no references to past attempts or clear future intentions beyond vague dissatisfaction.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. The vague phrase ""No one will care when I'm gone"" does not constitute an explicit suicidal expression, so according to the rules, this fits best under 'Indicator' rather than 'Ideation'. There are no elements of planning or past attempts, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""ending it soon,"" which implies suicide, and specific references to overdosing on ibuprofen as a method. Emotional indicators show overwhelming guilt, despair, and a desire to apologize to loved ones. There are no references to past attempts, but there is a clear indication of a plan involving a substance (ibuprofen). The post expresses fear of pain but still outlines a potential method.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""ending it soon"" and the discussion of overdosing. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user describes planning to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as overdosing on ibuprofen, which is a substance suitable for self-harm. There are no explicit signs of preparation like acquiring means or writing a note, but the mention of a specific method (overdosing) qualifies as a plan. Since a method is clearly indicated, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, such as ""soon,"" ""tonight or this week,"" with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (overdosing on ibuprofen), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves mentioning a method. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'ideation' because of the specific plan, or 'attempt' since no past action is described.

89,"I wanna die, but other people need me and it sucks. Hello, in the last few months i became pretty okay with sucide, i'm not afraid of death really, i already have a plan and all the reasons, but i feel like i shouldn't leave yet because of the potential guilt i would feel if i leave others. I'm currently living for other people and don't really see a brighter future for myself so it's just a matter of time when i will stop giving a fuck about others as well. I was wondering if there is someone else with similar situation and what is stopping you from offing yourself? Telling your loved ones about it. I decided that it's my time to go, i'm not asking for support or anything, i am sure about this decision but i'm asking you how can i tell my family that it's my final decision and nothing will change my mind? I'm going to starve myself to death because i'm dealing with lots of issues that can't really be solved. I'm 20 years old and my parents are pushing me to live more and don't really understand the situation. They will probably keep telling me to eat which is only natural to say if you care about someone but i've made up my mind. So another question, can they force me to eat if i end up in hospital or drug me? Thanks. I got a question. Does anybody have any experience or knowledge with starvation/VSED? I have lots of health problems and decided it's finally my time to go. Heard it's actually quite peaceful to go this way so i wanted to hear your opinions on that. Thanks.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of wanting to die (""I wanna die""), suicide (""became pretty okay with suicide"", ""offing yourself""), and self-harm methods (""I'm going to starve myself to death"", ""starvation/VSED""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""don't really see a brighter future for myself"" and ""living for other people and it sucks."" There are specific plans and methods mentioned, like starvation as a way to end life, and signs of preparation, such as asking how to tell family and inquiring about potential interventions like being forced to eat. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicide"", ""offing yourself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I wanna die"", ""it's my time to go""). Since these are clear, this leans toward a higher category than 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as starvation/VSED, which is a means to end life. Signs of preparation include having a plan (""I already have a plan""), deciding on the method, and considering how to handle family and potential hospitalization. This goes beyond vague thoughts, as it involves explicit planning, so it fits 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to starve myself"", ""it's my time to go""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (starvation as a method), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It exceeds 'ideation' due to the mention of methods and preparations, and it's not 'attempt' since no past actions are described. It's not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""i'm going to kill myself""), death, and a decision to end one's life. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year."" There are signs of preparation, like ""i already got my suicidal notes ready,"" but no specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are detailed. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""i'm going to kill myself"" and ""i've decided on it."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the post expresses a clear intent to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, though ""when and how"" implies consideration of methods without details. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" indicates preparation. Since preparations are mentioned, this aligns with 'behavior' criteria, but if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; however, the preparation is explicit here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions (""i'm going to kill myself,"" ""just a matter of when and how""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die, which goes beyond 'indicator.' It also mentions preparations (suicide notes), indicating a plan, which fits 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.' There are no past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.

91,"not much to say. i'm lonely, crying, and feel empty numb and void. my body is weak and i feel half way dead already'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, crying, feeling empty, numb, void, weak, and ""half way dead already."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm beyond the vague phrase ""half way dead already,"" which suggests a feeling of emotional numbness or exhaustion. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""feel half way dead already"" is a vague reference to feeling near death, it is not a direct expression. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings rather than past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and a vague feeling about dying, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator' since there is no explicit expression concerning suicide, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes direct statements like ""I want to die,"" indicating a desire for death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, such as ""I don't like anything about myself,"" ""I hate my job and my family,"" ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence,"" and ""sick and tired of crying myself to sleep every night."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I am not going to kill myself at least not any time soon.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I want to die"" and the implication in giving themselves ""5 more years just in case.""
   - This is clear, so it goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, though social media deactivation and isolation are mentioned, these do not constitute preparation for suicide. The statement about giving themselves 5 more years implies a future consideration but lacks details, so it does not qualify as a plan.
   - Since no specific plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (e.g., ""not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years""), but there are no descriptions of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, fitting the definition of 'ideation' as it lacks any specific plan or method. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions someone else's potential suicide (""I think he killed himself"" and ""he will kill himself""), expresses personal emotional distress (""I just feel broken and useless""), and describes a personal action (""i think at saturday i will go lay in some snow until I either freeze, or have a reason to live""). For the user, there are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair. There is a mention of a method involving exposure to snow to freeze, which implies self-harm or suicide risk. No references to past attempts for the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, for the user; it's implied through the description of laying in snow until freezing, but not directly stated as ""I want to kill myself."" However, it expresses a desire to potentially not be alive. Since it's not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context suggests more than vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, for the user: laying in snow until freezing, which is a method (hypothermia). There is a sign of preparation with the time specified (""at Saturday""). If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this appears to describe a specific plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions for the user (""at Saturday""), not past events. No past attempts are described for the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes expressions of distress and a specific plan (method and time), which aligns with 'behavior' as it mentions a plan to commit suicide. It's not just ideation without a plan, and there's no past attempt, so 'attempt' doesn't fit. The focus is on the user's own statements per the rules.

I feel like a broken human being. My being in itself is a prison""), causing pain to others (""All I've done for the past few months is cause anguish and pain to those around me""), and a direct statement about death (""I'm better off dead""). There are mentions of death through the phrase ""I'm better off dead,"" indicating a desire for death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and isolation (""Only 1 person left that cares. Can't stand this anymore""). There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there is a direct expression of wanting to die (""I'm better off dead""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through ""I'm better off dead"" and ""Can't stand this anymore."" Since this is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of ending life. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no explicit plan, this fits ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and emotions (e.g., ongoing distress and desires), with no mention of past events or attempts. It implies future intentions through the desire to die but does not specify any.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm better off dead""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it best fits 'ideation'. It is not 'indicator' due to the direct mention of being better off dead, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as there are no past actions described.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes – Words like ""die,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""overdose"" are used directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes – Phrases such as ""I want to die"" and ""Help me die"" clearly express this desire.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes – A past method (overdose) is described, and the user mentions choosing a ""new method"" and seeks suggestions for easy ways, implying potential tools or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes – The user refers to selecting a new method and actively requests help, which suggests intent to prepare.
   - Since specific methods and preparations are indicated, this aligns with planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""I tried to overdose a few months ago"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ""This time I chose a new method"" and ongoing requests for help).
   - Past attempts are specifically described, and current plans are also present.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit mentions of suicide, desires to die, specific methods, and a past attempt. It also describes current plans (new method and seeking ways). According to the definitions, since the post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it fits the 'Attempt' category.

   - Key elements include explicit mentions of death, dying, and suicide, such as ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag,"" ""I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT,"" and ""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL."" Emotional indicators show extreme hopelessness, despair, and frustration, e.g., ""I had enough of this,"" ""WHY! WHY! WHY!,"" and ""THIS NEEDS TO END!."" Specific plans and methods are mentioned, including the past method of suffocation and future intentions like ""I'm gonna try again tonight"" and ""I have another plan in mind"" which is described as more painful.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (the attempt last night) and current/future intentions (planning to try again tonight and having a backup plan). Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans, and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also includes current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt.'

   - This refers to current feelings and future fears (e.g., winter and holidays), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of wanting to die, fitting the definition of ideation, as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned.

I can't tell them about my depression and anxiety I can't tell them I need therapy I'm scared they'll just think it's an excuse for me to be lazy. I literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore so I really need it but idk what to di'I just wanna be loved but I'll never have love so I just wanna die.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, fear of judgment from parents, and a desire for therapy. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""I literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore,"" ""I'll never have love,"" and ""I just wanna die."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, self-harm, specific plans, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I just wanna die,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die. This is not vague but clear, so it qualifies as an explicit mention.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no plan is indicated, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., current lack of motivation and desire to die), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I just wanna die""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but there is no specific plan or method mentioned. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.
