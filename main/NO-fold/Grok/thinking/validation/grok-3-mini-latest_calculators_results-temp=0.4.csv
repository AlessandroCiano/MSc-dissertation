0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""Never will find love,"" ""Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown,"" ""everything in my life is crap,"" and ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself."" There are direct mentions of suicide and self-harm, specifically ""thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off."" Emotional indicators include feelings of worthlessness and dissatisfaction. Specific plans are mentioned, like going to a bridge and jumping off, which implies a method. There is a reference to ""again,"" suggesting past thoughts but not a detailed past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the post expresses a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ""go to a bridge and jump off,"" which identifies a location and method (jumping). There are no clear signs of preparation like acquiring tools or writing a note, but the mention of a specific plan qualifies as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and future intentions, like ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off,"" while ""thinking about ending my life again"" hints at past thoughts but does not describe a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (bridge and jumping), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a method, so 'Behavior' is the best fit.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress (""I'm inconsolable"") and a statement about impending death (""I'm going to die soon""). There are mentions of dying, which could imply death, but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but no details on past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" suggests a possible desire or prediction of death, but it is not a direct or explicit expression of suicidal intent. Since it is unclear and not very explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no mention of any plan, method, or preparation, this does not qualify as 'behavior'. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clearly not ideation either.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a future intention (""going to die soon""), not past events. There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and a vague statement about dying, but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to kill oneself. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because there is no explicit suicidal expression, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There is no plan, so it's not 'behavior' or 'attempt'.

No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""I hate living"" implies general distress, it does not explicitly state a desire to die. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings of dissatisfaction but does not specify past events or future intentions related to suicide. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

There are emotional indicators of desperation and a desire to die. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the post says ""Help me kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die (Yes).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions, as the user is actively seeking help now, not describing past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (barbiturates), which qualifies as explicit planning. Therefore, it fits best under 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan) or 'Indicator' (which lacks explicit mentions).

I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die painlessly, such as ""Is there a painless way to die"" and ""I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and isolation, like feeling unmotivated, scared, worthless, and tired. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""way to die"" and ""how to die with certainty and without pain,"" which indicate a desire to not be alive. There are direct expressions of wanting to die, so this is a clear yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods are mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, or locations). There are no signs of preparation, such as acquiring means or writing a note. Since there's no explicit plan, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions, such as ongoing struggles and desires, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' best, as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing how. It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly implied, not just general distress. It's not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and it's not 'Attempt' as there's no mention of past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include repeated mentions of wanting to die and kill oneself, such as ""want to kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" and ""kill ourselves."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, with phrases like ""life is all pointless,"" ""nothing matters after you die,"" and a general sense of existential futility. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, nor are there references to past attempts; it's focused on ongoing thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""want to kill myself,"" ""kill ourselves""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I still want to die,"" ""I should do it anyways""). Since these are clear, it goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. It's purely about thoughts and desires, so I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' due to the lack of explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past thoughts (e.g., ""for a year straight I was constantly thinking..."") and current feelings, but it does not describe any past attempts or concrete future intentions; it's ongoing ideation without action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as it involves a desire to not be alive without detailing how to act on it.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the explicit plan and overall expressions of hopelessness and wishing for a reset.
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, substances, or means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as writing a note or acquiring items.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die, self-loathing (""I don't like anything about myself""), dissatisfaction with life aspects (job, family, isolation), hopelessness (""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence,"" ""Nobody is getting anything out of this""), and emotional distress (""sick and tired of crying myself to sleep every night"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, locations, or any concrete means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, though social media deactivation and isolation are noted, these do not constitute direct preparation for suicide. The mention of ""5 more years just in case"" implies a future consideration but lacks specifics, so I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., not killing oneself soon but possibly in the future), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die and considering killing oneself in the future), which rules out 'Indicator'. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. It is not 'Attempt' since no past actions are described. Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal desires without a concrete plan.

I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of distress about work, life skills, money, housing, and social interactions. There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically ""the only way out is suicide"" and ""I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feeling empty, overwhelmed, scared, crying easily, and sensitivity. There are no specific plans beyond mentioning hanging, no signs of preparations like acquiring means, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""the only way out is suicide"" and ""I've considered hanging.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user expresses a desire to escape via suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging"" is mentioned as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of preparations like writing a note or acquiring tools.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with the criteria for 'behavior' as per the definitions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (hanging), which fits the 'behavior' category. Although there's no evidence of full preparation or action, the explicit mention of a method overrides 'ideation' based on the provided definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""i'm going to kill myself""), death, and self-harm intentions. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year."" There are signs of preparation with ""i already got my suicidal notes ready,"" but no specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) or references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""i'm going to kill myself"" and ""i've decided on it."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the post expresses a clear intent to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly (no details on tools, locations, or substances), but it implies consideration with ""just a matter of when and how."" Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" indicates preparation. Since preparation is evident, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""i'm going to kill myself,"" ""just a matter of when and how""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die, which rules out 'indicator.' It also mentions preparation (suicidal notes), which goes beyond mere thoughts and indicates planning, making it 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.' There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of self-loathing, dissatisfaction with appearance, and repeated attempts to change one's looks (e.g., dyeing and cutting hair, changing makeup, clothes, and eating habits). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as feeling ugly, horrible, and hating oneself, with comparisons to others. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a wish to ""be someone else"" or ""press a button"" to change, which implies escape but not explicit suicidal intent. Since it's unclear and not direct, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, or any suicide-related actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings and past efforts to improve appearance (e.g., ""I've dyed and cut my hair""), but there are no references to past suicide attempts or current/future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general distress, sadness, and hopelessness about self-image, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal expressions. Even with strong dissatisfaction, without mentioning suicide or killing oneself, it remains 'Indicator'. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

17,"What are you hoping to gain?. For anyone that posts that they are going to kill themselves or are in the process of doing so, what do you hope to gain by posting that information here? In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a discussion about why people post about killing themselves or being in the process of doing so. It mentions ""kill themselves"" and ""hurt themselves,"" which are references to suicide and self-harm, but these are in the context of other people's posts, not the writer's own experiences. There are no emotional indicators of hopelessness or despair from the writer; instead, it's an opinionated analysis suggesting such posters seek help. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in reference to others' posts (e.g., ""kill themselves""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive from the writer? No, the post does not express any personal suicidal thoughts or feelings. Since the suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, and there's no explicit mention of their own suicide, this leans toward not qualifying as ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. The post is hypothetical and about others, so there's no indication of any plan or method related to the writer.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current or general behaviors of others (e.g., posting about suicide), but it does not describe any past events, past attempts, or future intentions from the writer's perspective.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post lacks any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts from the writer. It is a commentary on others, with general dissatisfaction about such posts, but no direct indication of the writer's own risk. Based on the definitions, this fits best as 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned in relation to the writer, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, such as ""no point in existing,"" ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""I'm so tired of being alive,"" and ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself."" There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically ""kill myself"" and references to past failures in attempts. Emotional indicators include despair, sadness, tiredness, and feelings of rejection. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, but there are clear references to past attempts (""the past two times I've tried I've failed"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""no point in being alive anymore"" and ""I'm so tired of being alive.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing notes is indicated. Since there's no explicit planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to both past events (""the past two times I've tried I've failed"") and current/future intentions (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself""). The past attempts are specifically described as failed actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. Although there are current suicidal thoughts, they do not include specific plans, so it doesn't fit 'Behavior.' It goes beyond 'Ideation' due to the mention of past attempts. The rule states that if a post refers to past attempts, it should be classified as 'Attempt,' even if current thoughts are present without plans.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""killing myself,"" which directly references suicide, and ""I don't want to be alive,"" indicating a desire not to live. Emotional indicators include indifference and hopelessness, as seen in the dismissive tone towards societal judgments and the overall expression of not caring. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I don't want to be alive.""
   - This is clear and explicit, so it moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is mentioned, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings, as the language is in the present tense (e.g., ""I don't want to be alive"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), which fits 'ideation,' but lacks any specific plan or method, so it does not reach 'behavior.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, and it is not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""desire to kill myself,"" references to past overdose attempts, and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""what reason is there to live,"" ""why try when it genuinely makes things worse""). Specific methods are mentioned, like past overdoses and the idea of ""getting hit by an incoming train."" There are also references to past attempts and current desires to end life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""desire to kill myself,"" ""killing myself is painful"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I just want out of that tunnel,"" and contemplating death as an escape).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., past overdoses and the suggestion of ""getting hit by an incoming train"" as a means to escape).
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post describes past preparations implicitly through the overdoses but doesn't detail current ones; however, the mention of a specific method like a train indicates potential planning.
   - Since methods are referenced, this leans toward a category beyond just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""I've attempted an overdose twice within the past two weeks"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing desire and contemplating a train as an escape).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (overdoses) and also mentions current suicidal thoughts with potential plans (e.g., train). According to the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and includes current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme worry, panic attacks, crying, and fear related to potential diabetes, DIY HRT (MTF), and dependency on estrogen. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and overwhelm, such as ""it's just too much,"" ""I'm going insane,"" and ""I'm so fucking scared."" However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" suggests distress about dependency, it does not explicitly indicate a desire to die. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or method, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current fears and worries, with no mention of past events, past attempts, or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, or plans. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator' as there are no direct indications of suicidal feelings, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness (""There is NO hope left""), frustration with failed treatments (medications, therapy, biofeedback, EMDR, TMS), financial struggles ($786 a month, can't afford Ketamine, days without eating), repeated references to ""I tried"" which may imply past attempts at suicide or coping, and a concluding statement ""Now it's time to end it,"" suggesting a desire to die. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. Emotional indicators include despair and exhaustion.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, ""Now it's time to end it"" implies a desire to end one's life. Since this is a direct expression, it leans toward ideation, but the context must be considered further.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, locations, or any form of preparation. If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this doesn't apply directly here as no plan is evident.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., ""I've been on medication,"" ""I tried and tried again""), which could indicate past attempts, and shifts to current/future intentions with ""Now it's time to end it."" The repeated ""I tried"" suggests possible past suicide attempts, not just treatments.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes expressions of suicidal thoughts (""Now it's time to end it"") and references to past actions (""I tried and tried again""), which may describe past attempts. According to the definitions, if the post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. Even if ""I tried"" is ambiguous, the combination with current intent fits 'Attempt' over other categories.

In the pas I tried to hide this with saying ""I am misanthrope"" but no I wish I could have friends who supports me. I feel like a creature.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of being disliked by society, bullying on platforms like Reddit, self-doubt about personal flaws, daily thoughts of suicide, efforts to cope through activities like studying and daydreaming, persistent loneliness, disconnection from the world, and a past attempt to mask these feelings by claiming to be a misanthrope.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, the user explicitly states ""thinking about suicide everyday.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, loneliness, despair, and a sense of disconnection (e.g., feeling like a creature on the moon).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned; no details on how, when, or with what the user might act.
   - References to past attempts: The post mentions ""In the pas I tried to hide this,"" which appears to be a typo for ""In the past I tried to hide this,"" referring to hiding emotions, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""thinking about suicide everyday.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the daily thoughts of suicide and feelings of disconnection.
   - The mentions are clear, so this moves beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of notes, acquiring means, or planning.
   - Since no plan is evident, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers mainly to current and ongoing thoughts (e.g., ""thinking about suicide everyday"" and daily struggles), with a minor reference to the past about hiding feelings, which is not a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., daily thinking about suicide) but lacks any specific plan or method, aligning with 'Ideation'.
   - It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide.
   - It is not 'Behavior' as there are no signs of planning or preparations.
   - It is not 'Attempt' since no past suicide attempt is described, only past emotional coping.

Haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. There is no hell so I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April. For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, such as dropping out of college, cutting off friends, only living for family, excessive drinking and smoking leading to weight gain, lack of intimate relationships, and a lack of fear of death. There are mentions of death indirectly through ""I'm not scared to die"" and explicitly through ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" Emotional indicators include despair and giving up on life. Specific plans are referenced with ""a plan, note and date,"" suggesting preparations for an action. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not being scared to die (Yes). The mention of a plan and note implies suicidal intent, though not crystal clear. Since it's not fully explicit, I would lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the context pushes it further.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not mentioned (e.g., no tools or substances detailed), but there are signs of preparation with ""a plan, note and date,"" which aligns with a suicide note and scheduled action. This indicates explicit planning, so it goes beyond mere thoughts. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here the preparations are evident.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., dropping out of college, gaining weight) and current feelings, but the plan with a date in early April points to future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., not fearing death and giving up) and mentions preparations like a plan, note, and date, which qualify as explicit planning under the 'Behavior' definition. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to the implied and prepared intent, nor 'Ideation' because of the specific preparations, and it's not 'Attempt' as no past action is described. Thus, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions suicidal thoughts, desires to kill oneself, self-harm (e.g., ""cuts all over myself""), emotional indicators like hopelessness and anger (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts have just been too much,"" ""no one would care or miss me""), and a vague reference to potential future actions (e.g., going to the ER or killing oneself). There are no mentions of death or dying outside of suicide context, no specific methods or tools, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself,"" ""go through with it and kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end up dead,"" ""my last post ever"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are detailed (e.g., no mention of how to kill oneself, just a general idea of ""going through with it"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? No clear signs, as the user says they are ""still debating"" and ""haven't even left home yet."" Since this is uncertain, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and potential future intentions (e.g., debating actions now), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or preparation for suicide (e.g., no methods or means are outlined). This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves thoughts without detailed planning. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no specific plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include direct mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I can't kill myself"" and ""I'm suicidal."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, and isolation, like ""I'm not special to anything or anyone or myself"" and feelings of not being believed by others. There is a reference to a specific location (a cliff) as a potential method for suicide, indicating a way to end one's life. No references to past attempts are present, and no explicit preparations like acquiring tools or writing a note are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I can't kill myself"" and ""I'm suicidal.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through expressions of exhaustion, worthlessness, and the inability to follow through on suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post references a ""good cliff"" as a location for jumping, which qualifies as a specific method or means. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring means or notes, but the mention of the cliff and the distance (4-5km) suggests awareness of a method. Since specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present, this leans toward 'behavior' per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers primarily to current intentions and feelings, as seen in phrases like ""I can't kill myself"" and ""I just can't commit to it."" There are no descriptions of past attempts, only past discussions about being suicidal.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a specific method (cliff), which aligns with the definition of 'behavior' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts along with a plan or method. Although no active preparations are detailed, the mention of a specific location for suicide qualifies it as 'behavior' based on the rules. If unsure, we would choose 'ideation,' but here the criteria for 'behavior' are met.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme exhaustion, self-hatred, isolation, and hopelessness. Phrases like ""i'm tired of everything,"" ""i'm tired of hating myself,"" ""i wish i was never born,"" and ""i have nothing going for me in my life"" indicate emotional distress, despair, and dissatisfaction with life. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and self-loathing, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""i wish i was never born"" suggests regret of existence but does not explicitly express a desire to die or end one's life currently. Since this is unclear and not a direct mention, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to ongoing current feelings and past events (e.g., mean things said at school), but there are no references to past suicide attempts or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

Do you want to talk?' I can't wait to fucking kill myself and have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral. It's gonna be one last big fuck you",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""I can't wait to fucking kill myself""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""Depressed,"" ""This month has already been a shit show,"" feelings of being unsupported by family), and references to a future funeral as a form of retaliation. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself,"" which clearly expresses a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations like acquiring means. Since no explicit plan is described, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I can't wait,"" ""It's gonna be""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method for carrying it out. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as it involves suicidal feelings without detailed planning. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, or 'Attempt' since no past actions are referenced.

29,"I'm ready. I'm finally ready to just end it all, I'm gonna wait a few weeks but I already know how I'm gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell anyone either, all ready tried that before and no one really understands. So goodbye everybody, I doubt anyone will care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and suicide, such as ""end it all"" and ""goodbye everybody,"" which imply a desire to die. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like feeling that no one understands and doubting anyone will care. There are signs of a specific plan, as the post states ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" and ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks,"" suggesting timing and method. There is a reference to past actions, but it appears to mean trying to tell someone before, not a past suicide attempt.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end it all"" and the overall context of preparing to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I'm ready to just end it all"" and ""goodbye everybody.""
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post indicates a plan with ""I already know how I'm gonna do it,"" implying a known method, even if not detailed. Additionally, ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks"" suggests preparation or timing.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, through the waiting period and decision not to tell anyone.
   - Since a plan is implied, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions, such as being ready now and planning to act in a few weeks. The reference to ""all ready tried that before"" is about past efforts to seek help, not a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""end it all"") and mentions a plan (""I already know how""), which fits the 'behavior' category. It does not describe a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable. There are explicit elements beyond just ideation, making 'indicator' or 'ideation' less fitting.

I can be as kind as I want but they'll always see me the way I am. Nothing.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post expresses feelings of being a burden, disappointment, worthlessness, and hopelessness. Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to kill oneself (""I can't even fucking kill myself""), holding a blade as a potential method of self-harm, and thoughts that others would be better off without the poster. Emotional indicators include despair and self-loathing. There are references to a method (blade) but no clear preparations or detailed plans. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I can't even fucking kill myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a blade is mentioned as a potential means. Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, as it's about holding the blade but not acting. Since a specific method is referenced, this leans toward 'behavior' per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events or completed attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (blade), which qualifies as explicit planning under the 'behavior' definition. Although there's no full plan or preparation described, the mention of a method pushes it to 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

People love plastic, and people love plastic people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of frustration with life, conformity, family neglect, and self-description as a ""depressed 16 year old."" There is a mention of death in the phrase ""how about i die then,"" indicating a desire for death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and general dissatisfaction with life. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the phrase ""how about i die then,"" which directly expresses a desire for death.
   - Since this is a direct expression of wanting to die, it goes beyond vague distress, but I must lean toward 'indicator' if unclear. However, this phrasing is sufficiently explicit about dying to qualify as more than just general dissatisfaction.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and frustrations, with no mention of past events or future intentions beyond the immediate expression.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes an explicit expression of wanting to die (""how about i die then""), which fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It is not merely general distress, so it exceeds 'Indicator.' There is no plan or method, so it is not 'Behavior,' and no past attempt is mentioned, so it is not 'Attempt.'

At least I DID try.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of ""killing myself,"" ""taking my own life,"" and not living to see a specific birthday in 2023. There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and a sense that life is pointless, as seen in phrases like ""There is no hope. All is lost"" and ""It is pointless."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. There is a vague reference to ""At least I DID try,"" which might imply past efforts to cope with life but does not clearly indicate a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""taking my own life""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I will be taking my own life,"" ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means. Are there signs of preparation? No, beyond the wallpaper as a reminder, which does not constitute preparation like acquiring means. Since no explicit plan is present, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to future intentions (e.g., ""I will be taking my own life,"" ""When it will happen I am unsure""). There is no clear description of past attempts, though ""I DID try"" is mentioned, it does not specify a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, making it a best fit for 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'Attempt' as it focuses on future intentions rather than past actions.

I shouldn't have talked myself down . Everyday I want to go back and kill myself . The worse decision I ever made was staying here .",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme tiredness, emotional distress, feelings of being criticized and unloved, and explicit references to suicide. Specifically, the user mentions a past opportunity to ""kill myself"" 6 months ago that they did not act on, expresses regret for not doing so, and states that they want to ""go back and kill myself"" every day. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations, such as tools, locations, or substances. References to past events exist, but they describe a missed opportunity rather than an actual attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I want to go back and kill myself"" and regret for ""staying here.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no explicit plan is described, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (the opportunity 6 months ago) and current/future intentions (wanting to kill themselves every day). However, the past reference is not a concrete attempt, as it describes backing down rather than an action taken.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, which fits the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not an attempt, as no concrete past action is described, only a missed opportunity. Therefore, the best category is ideation.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include feelings of weakness, betrayal by a best friend who is dating the user's ex, difficulty in cutting ties due to proximity and shared social circles, self-criticism for not following through on an ultimatum, and expressions of hopelessness about relationships and being used. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair, embarrassment, and a sense of being pathetic, but nothing directly tied to suicidal thoughts. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on interpersonal conflicts and self-doubt without any reference to ending one's life. Since it's unclear or absent, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any suicide-related plans, so no need to consider 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and recent events, such as giving an ultimatum last week and ongoing social interactions, but it does not reference past or future suicidal intentions or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness about life and relationships, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as there are no suicidal thoughts expressed, and the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions.

I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad.

I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of deep sadness, hopelessness, and a desire to escape life, such as ""I feel hollow,"" ""I have to live another day,"" ""I just want to not exist,"" and ""God I fucking hate myself."" There are mentions of emotional distress, isolation, and self-loathing, but no direct references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I just want to not exist"" and ""I have to live another day"" indicate a desire to not be alive.
   - Although not highly explicit, this leans toward being an indicator of suicidal thoughts, but the expression of wanting to not exist qualifies as explicit enough for ideation based on the definition.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Since no planning is evident, if it qualifies for a higher category, it would be ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post refers to current feelings and past experiences (e.g., not enjoying birthdays for years), but it focuses on ongoing distress rather than past suicide attempts or future intentions with specifics.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to not be alive (""I just want to not exist""), which fits the definition of Ideation without any specific plan. There is no mention of suicide or killing oneself, but the desire to not exist is direct enough to classify as Ideation rather than Indicator, based on the category definitions. If in doubt, I would lean toward Indicator, but here it meets the criteria for Ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include multiple expressions of wanting to die, such as ""I just want to end it,"" ""I just want to put a bullet right through it,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""someone please murder me because I don't have the balls to take my own life,"" and repeated phrases like ""I just want to die"" and ""I hate being alive."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are evident in statements like ""I'm losing my mind,"" ""I'm having a complete breakdown,"" ""I hate myself,"" ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""tired of being alone,"" ""feeling worthless,"" and ""tired of failing everything."" A specific method is mentioned (""put a bullet right through it""), which implies using a gun. There are no references to past attempts or preparations like acquiring means.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as seen in phrases like ""I just want to end it,"" ""take my own life,"" and ""I just want to die."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), with repeated statements of not wanting to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), such as ""put a bullet right through it,"" which refers to using a bullet or gun as a means. There are no signs of preparation described, like writing a note or acquiring tools. Since a specific method is explicitly stated, this aligns with planning, so I classify it as indicating 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I just want to""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""put a bullet right through it""), which meets the criteria for 'Behavior' as it involves explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts along with a plan (specific method). It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Ideation' because of the specific method, or 'Attempt' since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""i'm on suicide watch"", ""i wish i could just fucking end it""), death (""it would be better if i was dead""), and self-harm (""i could take a bunch of pills""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""i really wasn't made for life"", ""it's too painful"", ""i loathe myself"", and expressions of worthlessness (""i contribute nothing""). There is a specific plan mentioned: ""i could take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep"", which references a method (pills) and timing (while everyone is asleep). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""i'm on suicide watch"" and ""end it""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""it would be better if i was dead"" and ""i wish i could just fucking end it""). Since these are clear, this leans away from 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ""take a bunch of pills"", which is a substance for self-harm. There are signs of potential preparation implied in the timing (""while everyones asleep""). Since a specific method is described, this qualifies as more than just ideation, pointing toward 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's explicit.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""i could take a bunch of pills""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die) and a specific plan (method of pills and timing), which fits the 'behavior' category as it mentions a plan to commit suicide. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'ideation' because of the specific plan, or 'attempt' since no past actions are described.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user's concern for their friend who may commit suicide soon, the user's own history of suicidal thoughts and a past attempt, and emotional indicators like past stress, anxiety, and depression for the user. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., the friend's potential suicide and the user's past attempt). Emotional indicators for the user include past hopelessness due to Crohn's Disease, but they state they are currently in a good place. No specific plans or methods are mentioned for the user, only a reference to their 2009 attempt. There are no signs of current preparations for the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, for the user, as they mention their own past suicidal ideation and a serious attempt in 2009. However, there are no direct expressions of current wanting to die from the user; they explicitly state they haven't had suicidal ideation in months. Since the focus is on the user's risk, this is noted.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, for the user. They reference a past attempt but provide no details on methods or current preparations. There are no signs of planning for the user, so this does not elevate to 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events for the user (suicidal history and attempt in 2009) and current concerns about the friend, but no current or future intentions are expressed by the user. The past attempt is specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post describes the user's past suicide attempt in 2009, which fits the 'Attempt' category as it focuses on historic actions. There are no current suicidal thoughts or plans mentioned by the user, so it does not qualify as 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' because a past attempt is explicitly described. Based on the rules, the classification is for the person writing the post, and this content centers on their historic attempt.

   - Key elements in the post include expressions of fear that therapy won't work, parental concern, ongoing intrusive thoughts referenced as ""lol kermit sewer slide"" (which is a slang or meme for suicide), temptation from these thoughts, emotional exhaustion from fear and shame, feelings of laziness and lack of motivation, and overall hopelessness about improvement.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: There is a reference to ""lol kermit sewer slide,"" which is commonly understood as a euphemism for suicidal thoughts or jumping off something to end one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, fear, shame, and tiredness are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned; it's just about the thoughts being tempting.
   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""lol kermit sewer slide,"" which directly implies suicidal thoughts, even if it's slang.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user describes these thoughts as tempting and persistent, indicating a desire to not be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the reference is indirect via slang, it is a recognized expression of suicidal ideation, so I am considering it explicit enough for 'ideation' based on the definition.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs are present.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is indicated, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current thoughts and feelings, with no mention of past events or future plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., the meme reference and temptation), indicating a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because of the explicit suicidal reference, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

40,"I hate myself so much. Overall I'm terrible. And I know I'm objective because there are some good things about me, I have a few talents and positive traits. But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward and don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes multiple mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I want to kill myself so badly,"" ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train,"" and references to wanting to die via other means like being killed by serial killers. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-hatred, and despair (e.g., ""I hate myself so much,"" ""My life is so disgusting and pathetic,"" ""I hate being alive""). There are hints of specific methods (jumping in front of a train) and thoughts about preparations (e.g., dealing with belongings and phone after death). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I want to kill myself so badly"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I hate being alive,"" ""I wish I was never born"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., jumping in front of a train as a method).
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are indirect signs, such as concerns about end-of-life logistics (belongings, phone), but not fully explicit preparations like writing a note. Since a specific method is mentioned, this indicates a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., wishing to act on suicidal thoughts), with no description of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die) and mentions a specific method (jumping in front of a train), which aligns with 'Behavior' as it includes both suicidal ideation and an explicit plan. It goes beyond vague thoughts, so it's not 'Indicator' or 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include direct mentions of wanting to kill oneself (""I want to kill myself""), expressions of emotional distress such as hopelessness and despair (""I can't breathe,"" ""I'm useless,"" ""everyone would be better off with me dead""), and repeated exclamations of frustration (""Fuck me"" repeatedly). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor are there references to past attempts. The post focuses on current emotional pain and a desire to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I want to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""everyone would be better off with me dead.""
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward acting on the thoughts.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the 'Ideation' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicide mention, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

42,"confinement mental break down. i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it. i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of mental breakdown, thoughts of self-harm (slitting wrists), and emotional indicators like growing depression and feelings of loneliness. There are no direct mentions of death or dying beyond the self-harm thought, no specific plans or methods beyond the idea, and no references to past attempts.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through expressions of growing depression and feeling alone.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Slitting my wrists"" is mentioned as a thought, which is a method, but there's no indication of actual preparation or intent to act.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to ""slitting my wrists,"" which implies a suicidal method.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the thought of self-harm and expressions of depression.
   - The mention is somewhat explicit, but since it's framed as a thought that wasn't acted upon, it leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only a thought is described, with no mention of tools, locations, or any steps taken.
   - Since there's no explicit plan or preparation, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this fits ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a current thought (""today""), not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., thinking about slitting wrists) without a specific plan or preparations, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress but does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' due to the absence of explicit planning. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses dental issues (teeth grinding, pain, and shame from neglect due to past depression). It mentions emotional indicators like shame, worry, and pain. There is a reference to ""suicidal feelings coming back,"" but no mentions of death, dying, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are implied through shame and the return of suicidal feelings.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts, only past depression.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" directly references suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""suicidal feelings"" implies a desire to not be alive, as it explicitly uses the term related to suicide.
   - Since this is explicit, I do not lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs at all.
   - Since there is no indication of a plan, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, but here it's clear there's no plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past depression and current suicidal feelings returning, indicating present thoughts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past depression is mentioned, not any attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal feelings are coming back""), which fits the definition of Ideation as it involves desires related to not wanting to live without any specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include a request for help with basic necessities for the user and their dog, and a statement expressing a desire to die.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of ""suicide notes,"" an indication of imminent departure (""I'm leaving soon""), emotional expressions of love for loved ones, and a resolved mindset (""My mind's made up""). There are mentions of death and suicide through the reference to suicide notes. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, as the user is preparing for an end. Specific plans or preparations are evident in the request for help with suicide notes, which is a form of preparation. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user directly refers to ""suicide notes."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""My mind's made up,"" which imply a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are detailed. Are there signs of preparation?

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""I'm leaving soon,"" rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to leave and expressions of love in notes) and signs of preparation (suicide notes), which align with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the preparation element, and it's not an 'attempt' since no past action is described. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post includes key elements such as references to past suicide attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts""), explicit mentions of suicide (""my suicide date,"" ""end things""), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, trauma, and distrust, and a specific date for a planned action (""This Friday, May 14, 2021""). There are no detailed methods or preparations described, but the date implies intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""my suicide date,"" ""I didn't die last night,"" ""end thing v v soon""). Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I'm fucking done,"" ""enough is enough"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: A specific date is mentioned (""This Friday, May 14, 2021""), which could indicate planning, but no explicit methods, tools, or preparations (like substances or locations) are detailed. Since it's not fully clear if this constitutes explicit planning, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if not for other factors, but the rules will guide the final category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., ""8 yrs of constant attempts,"" recent trauma) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""suicide date"" on a specific future date).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans (specific date), and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also includes current plans, it should be classified as 'Attempt'.

No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness, dissatisfaction with life, and a desire to disappear or cease existing. Phrases like ""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35,"" and metaphors such as ""the missing pixel which burned out"" suggest a vague wish for non-existence. Emotional indicators include despair, frustration with society, and a sense of pointlessness. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm in explicit terms, no specific plans or methods, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) The post does not use words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (No) While there are indirect expressions like ""I want to disappear forever,"" these are metaphorical and not direct, so I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is unclear, so I choose 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) No tools, locations, substances, or preparations are referenced.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) Nothing indicates any steps toward action.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no planning, so 'behavior' does not apply.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings and a future prediction (""I will die by 35""), with no reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'. There are no plans, behaviors, or past attempts described.

There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""kill yourself,"" ""hanging myself,"" and ""I'm trying to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I'm trying to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as hanging (with references to tools/locations like the shower or door frame) and taking pills (a substance). There are no clear signs of preparation like acquiring means, but the discussion of methods indicates planning. Since methods are explicitly detailed, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions (e.g., uncertainty about methods working), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and specific methods (hanging and pills), which aligns with the 'behavior' category as it involves planning. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing ways to commit suicide, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die""), which rules out 'indicator.' There is no specific plan or method, so it fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.' It does not describe past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to pills, which could imply a method for self-harm or suicide. There's an emotional indicator of hopelessness and despair, as the user expresses feeling like a coward and believes no one loves or cares for them. The post mentions counting pills nightly and wondering why they didn't take them all, suggesting contemplation of overdose but no explicit description of a full plan or past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., the word ""suicide"" is not used), but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, as in wondering why they didn't take all the pills, which implies a desire to end their life. Since this leans toward expressions of suicidal thoughts, it goes beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (pills), which could be a means for suicide. However, there's no clear sign of current preparation or a detailed plan, such as acquiring more pills or setting a time. Given the uncertainty about an explicit plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to ongoing behaviors (counting pills every night) and past inaction (wondering why they didn't take them all), but it doesn't describe a completed past attempt or a future intention explicitly.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to have taken the pills), with a method implied, but without a specific plan or preparation for future action. This fits 'Ideation' best, as it involves suicidal feelings without the elements required for 'Behavior'. If in doubt, the rules emphasize choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. There is a reference to past experiences with the psych ward, but it does not explicitly describe past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general distress and struggles, but nothing directly indicates suicidal thoughts. Since it is unclear and leans toward general dissatisfaction, I am choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of mental illness, inability to afford treatment, difficulty maintaining employment due to health issues, frustration with financial burdens, and overall hopelessness. There are mentions of suicide and self-harm with the phrase ""just killing myself,"" indicating a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include despair and frustration, as seen in ""what's the fucking point in any of this."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as implied in ""what's the point in not"" and directly stated. This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations like acquiring means. Since there's no explicit plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current struggles and future intentions, as in ""I'm going to end up getting fed up... and just killing myself."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""killing myself""), indicating a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves explicit expressions of suicidal feelings without detailing a plan. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations, but it does reference a past attempt.

There are mentions of wanting a ""non painful way to do this"" and ""I cant live anymore,"" which imply thoughts of death or dying. Emotional indicators include despair, fatigue from fighting, and a sense of inescapable punishment. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I cant live anymore"" directly express a desire to not be alive. Since this is a clear expression of wanting to end life, even without the word ""suicide,"" it qualifies as more than just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there is a vague reference to wanting a ""non painful way to do this,"" but no details on tools, locations, substances, or preparations are provided. Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""I want to kill myself next week with drugs""), a specific method (""with drugs""), and preparations (""I just have to write a suicide note""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and concern for family (""my family is upset,"" ""I hope they understand me""). There are no references to past attempts or self-harm beyond the planned action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes) through phrases like ""kill myself."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), as the user states a clear desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), such as ""with drugs."" Signs of preparation are present (Yes), including writing a suicide note. This goes beyond vague thoughts, indicating a plan, so it fits 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts along with a specific plan (time, method) and preparations (suicide note), which aligns with the 'behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme tiredness, lack of motivation, feelings of loneliness, jealousy, regret over behavior due to illness, financial struggles, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., cyclic nature of life, work, college, relationships). 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There is a vague phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue,"" which could imply a desire to end life, but it is not explicit. No direct mentions of suicide, death, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, loneliness, and jealousy, such as ""i'm always tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""it's so lonely,"" and general dissatisfaction with life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned; no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or equivalent is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon"" is vague and could refer to life in general, but it is not a direct expression of wanting to die. Given the instruction to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I am considering this as not explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to any methods, tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs are present.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since there is no indication of any plan, this step does not apply, but overall, it leans away from 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily discusses current feelings and struggles, with a possible future implication in the vague phrase mentioned, but no concrete future plans. No past events like attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and vague dissatisfaction, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings, and when in doubt about explicitness, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'. There are no elements of planning or past attempts, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' do not apply.

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of overdosing on Zoloft, expressions of regret, a desire for suffering to end, mixed feelings about the action, and physical effects like a headache. There are indicators of self-harm (overdosing), emotional distress (regret and feeling like a nuisance), and a vague reference to wanting suffering to be over, but no explicit mention of suicide as the goal. Specific methods are noted (500mg Zoloft), and there's a description of the action taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the user states ""I don't want to die,"" but they describe an act of self-harm. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, they explicitly say they don't want to die, though they want suffering to end. Since it's not clearly explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the self-harm act pushes it further.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (500mg Zoloft as a means of self-punishment). There are signs of preparation or action taken (they've already overdosed), but no ongoing plans described. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's an executed action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a very recent or ongoing event (""I have overdosed,"" ""It hasn't been that long""), describing an action that has just happened, rather than past attempts or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action of overdosing, which qualifies as a past attempt at self-harm. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Attempt' because it involves a historic action (the overdose has occurred), even if recent. It doesn't qualify as 'Indicator' due to the self-harm description, 'Ideation' because there's no just planning without action, or 'Behavior' as it's not about current plans but a completed act.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""I'm going to,"" ""I'm ready to go,"" and ""I'm ready,"" which imply an intention to end one's life, though not explicitly stated as suicide. Emotional indicators include feeling ""at peace,"" suggesting resignation or acceptance. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, self-harm, or past attempts. The post expresses a sense of readiness after spending time with a loved one, indicating emotional preparation but not concrete actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I'm doing it,"" ""I'm going to,"" and ""I'm ready to go"" directly express a desire to end one's life, even if not using the exact term. However, since it's not crystal clear and the rules instruct to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I must carefully consider this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, locations, or any concrete means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post mentions spending time with a favorite person and now feeling ready, which could hint at emotional preparation, but this is not explicit (e.g., no mention of writing a note or acquiring items). If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to future intentions (""in the near future,"" ""I'm going to,"" ""I'm ready""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to end one's life (e.g., ""I'm ready to go""), fitting the definition of Ideation as explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It does not qualify as Indicator because, despite the lack of the word ""suicide,"" the expressions are direct enough to indicate suicidal feelings. It is not Behavior due to the absence of any specific method or preparations, and not Attempt as there are no past actions described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of being ""suicidal"" in the past, frustration with how it was handled by school authorities, and current rumination on that event (e.g., ""i cant stop thinking about""). There are emotional indicators of dissatisfaction and annoyance, but no mentions of death, dying, self-harm beyond the past reference, no specific plans or methods, and no references to actual past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""i was suicidal."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as this refers to a past state rather than current desires. However, the mention of being suicidal is explicit, so this leans toward ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there's no indication of any plan, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to past events (""it was 4 yrs ago""), specifically being identified as suicidal in high school. There is a current element of thinking about it, but no indication of current or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions ""i was suicidal,"" which indicates past suicidal thoughts without describing any actual attempts or plans. This fits Ideation, as it involves explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (even if historical) without a specific plan. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned; not Behavior due to the absence of any plan; and not Attempt because no concrete past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct mentions of death and dying (""i should die"", ""made up my mind to kill myself""), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and self-loathing (""I am just rubbish sucking at everything"", ""I hate my family"", ""I have no friends""), and signs of preparation (""I have prepared everything""). There are no explicit references to specific methods, tools, or past attempts, but the preparation aspect is noted.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not detailed (e.g., no mention of tools or locations), but there are signs of preparation (""I have prepared everything""), which indicates planning. Since preparation is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current or recent intentions (""made up my mind to kill myself a few days"" and ""I have prepared everything""), not past events. There are no descriptions of actual past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""i should die"", ""kill myself"") and mentions preparation (""I have prepared everything""), which qualifies as explicit planning. This fits the 'behavior' category, as it goes beyond mere ideation by including preparations, even if methods are not specified.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness about future living situations, a desire to vanish without a trace, and detailed preparations for leaving. There are mentions of death implied through finding a secluded spot where no one will find the body and having a pistol. Emotional indicators include feelings of being unwanted and having nothing to look forward to. Specific plans or methods mentioned: emptying bank account, leaving belongings, walking with cash and shoes, and carrying a pistol, canteen, and clothes. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though it's strongly implied. Since it's not explicit, I would lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the presence of a plan complicates this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods mentioned: Pistol (as a tool), secluded spot (as a location). Signs of preparation: Emptying bank account, leaving belongings, avoiding traceable items like phone or car. This goes beyond vague thoughts, indicating a specific plan, so it fits 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (e.g., ""when that happens I will""), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die, fitting the definition of ideation, which involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general distress (as in indicator) but lacks any mention of plans or methods (as required for behavior). There are no references to past attempts, so attempt does not apply.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""I've been suicidal for about 10 years,"" ""when I do do it,"" and references to death and dying like ""I don't want the existence I've got"" and ""it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, disconnection, and past self-harm (e.g., scratching and punching oneself). Specific plans are mentioned, including deciding on a location (woodland), preparations like leaving notes to warn others, and avoiding doing it at home. References to past behaviors include childhood self-harm and violent actions, but not explicit past suicide attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I've been suicidal for about 10 years"" and ""when I do do it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I don't want the existence I've got"" and ""I'm on the edge.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, implied methods like using a rope (e.g., ""Although I've not gone and got a rope"") and preparations such as choosing a woodland location and planning to leave notes to warn dog walkers and instruct them to call the police.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, including pushing people away to make it easier and deciding on the location and aftermath actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., childhood self-harm, past consultations) and current/future intentions (e.g., deciding on a plan for suicide). There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, only past self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and direct expressions of wanting to die, which rules out 'Indicator.' It also mentions specific plans and preparations (e.g., location and notes), which go beyond just ideation and fit the definition of 'Behavior.' There are no descriptions of a past suicide attempt, so 'Attempt' does not apply. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore . I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include frustration and anger towards the user's mother regarding driving restrictions, delayed license, and feelings of being controlled. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore,"" which indicate explicit suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and anger, with phrases like ""I hate my life"" and ""I'm so sick and tired."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore,"" which directly express a desire to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current frustrations and emotions, with no mention of past events or attempts; it's focused on present feelings.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method for suicide. This fits best under 'Ideation' as per the definition, which covers explicit desires without planning. It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

No one in my life cares. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to help me stay alive. No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of being suicidal (from the hotline conversation), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and desperation, and expressions of isolation (no one cares, no one will miss me). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user references being told it's ""silly to be suicidal at my age."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""no one will miss me when I'm gone"" and the implication in ""tonight's the night I guess.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""tonight's the night I guess"" suggests a possible intention for tonight, but it lacks explicit details or preparations, so I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (e.g., ""tonight's the night""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to not be alive, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as it involves suicidal feelings without explicit planning.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to ""oxy"" (likely oxycodone, a substance), and ""cutting an artery"" (a method of self-harm that could be fatal). There are no explicit emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair, but the query implies consideration of self-harm. Specific methods are mentioned (oxy to lessen pain during artery cutting), and this could relate to suicide, but there's no reference to past attempts or preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the post does not directly state a desire to die or commit suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, it's framed as a question about pain management. Since it's not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context suggests more than general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as using oxy (a substance) to reduce pain while cutting an artery (a potentially lethal act). There are no clear signs of preparation like acquiring items, but the discussion of combining methods indicates a potential plan. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, the specific methods described push toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This appears to refer to current or future intentions, as the post is asking a hypothetical question about the act. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post lacks explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts but includes specific methods (oxy and cutting an artery), which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves mentioning a plan. It goes beyond vague ideation due to the detailed methods, so 'behavior' fits best.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user's description of a conversation with a friend who predicted the user might commit suicide, references to the user's mental health diagnoses (BPD and CPTSD), and expressions of emotional hurt, upset, and uncertainty about how to respond. There are mentions of suicide, but these are attributed to the friend's statements, not the user's own thoughts. Emotional indicators include feelings of hurt, lack of faith from the friend, and general dissatisfaction with how the friend handled the situation, but no direct expressions of hopelessness or despair from the user regarding their own life. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts mentioned by the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in the context of what the friend said, not as an expression from the user themselves.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user is expressing distress about the friend's words and seeking advice, but not their own suicidal desires.
   - Since the mentions are not from the user and are not explicit indicators of the user's thoughts, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - There is no indication of any planning, so 'behavior' does not apply, and we would choose 'ideation' if there were thoughts, but there aren't.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event (the conversation a couple of weeks ago) and current emotional impact, but there are no references to past attempts or current/future intentions of suicide from the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post involves general expressions of distress related to mental health and hurtful comments from others, but lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, desires, plans, or past attempts from the user. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned by the person writing the post, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'. The focus is on the user's reaction to external statements, not their own risk.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions being at the window with scissors, feeling like cutting the screen and jumping out. This includes references to self-harm (scissors as a tool) and potential death (jumping out a window). Emotional indicators include desperation and pleas for help (""please help me,"" ""I don't know what to do""), along with feelings of hopelessness as a teen alone at night. There are specific plans mentioned (scissors, window, cutting and jumping) but no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the description of intending to cut the screen and jump out implies a desire to end one's life.
   - Since it's not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit intent, I'll proceed with caution, noting that the actions described suggest more than vague thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, scissors (tool), window (location), and the act of cutting the screen and jumping (method).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user is currently at the window with scissors, indicating immediate preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here the details are specific enough to indicate a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current intentions (""right now""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (scissors, cutting screen, jumping), which aligns with 'Behavior'. It goes beyond vague ideation due to the mention of methods and preparation, and it's not about past attempts, so 'Attempt' doesn't fit. 'Indicator' is too mild as there's clear intent beyond general distress.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of overdosing on iron pills, which is a form of self-harm that could lead to death. Emotional indicators include expressions of ongoing pain (""i have pain everyday"") and a desire not to deal with it, indicating hopelessness and despair. There are no references to past attempts, but there is a specific plan mentioned (overdosing on iron pills).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with the word ""suicide,"" but there is a direct expression of wanting to end the suffering through an action that implies wanting to die (""i'm gonna overdose"" and ""i don't wanna deal with it""). Since this is a clear indication of intent, even if not using the exact term, it leans toward explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as overdosing on iron pills, which is a substance-based method. There are no explicit signs of preparation like acquiring means or writing a note, but the statement implies a plan. Given that a method is specified, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""i'm gonna overdose""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire not to deal with pain) and a specific plan (overdosing on iron pills), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to the presence of a plan, not just general distress. It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method is mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' as this is about future intent, not a past action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide and death, such as ""im going to kill myself one day,"" ""might as well die,"" and ""want to run away to a forest and fucking die.""

Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feeling useless, alone, and crying. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, nor are there references to past attempts. The post focuses on passive wishes for death rather than active self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""end it all""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""hoping to be murdered""). This is clear and not vague.

   - Key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as persistent sadness, anxiety, depression, feeling like a burden, emotional abuse from the mother, reliance on inebriation for happiness, and a sense of hopelessness. There are mentions of not wanting to continue living, like ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" and ""I'm starting to want to wave the white flag."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion from mental health struggles. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or direct equivalents are not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here"" and ""I don't think I can do it anymore"" imply a desire not to be alive.
   - Since there are direct expressions of not wanting to be alive, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator, even if not crystal clear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward planning or executing a suicide.
   - Since there is no evidence of a plan, this should be classified as ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to current feelings and ongoing struggles, with no specific references to past events like suicide attempts. It expresses current intentions of giving up but without future-oriented planning.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., not wanting to be here), which fits the definition of ideation.

I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago, he lost his mother to cancer, got bullied, got kicked out of school because of a false accusation which stated that he was planning a rebellion and how they were making a very small amount of money. The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's wish to donate their life to another person, references to the other person's past suicidal state and hardships, and the user's own statements about not deserving or wanting to live. There are mentions of suicide through the phrase ""he was suicidal like me,"" indicating the user's own suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and self-deprecation, such as ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts by the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""he was suicidal like me"" and the user's direct expression of not wanting to live. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in statements like ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and the desire to donate their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to the other person's past suicidal experiences, but for the user, it describes current feelings and intentions, such as not wanting to live. No past attempts are specifically described for the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as the desire to not live, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation' as defined. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

Soda and junk will kill me faster. Hope it all ends soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""I'm ready to die,"" indicating a desire for death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""I'm tired of it,"" ""it's a fucking joke,"" and frustration with family, healing, meds, and therapy. There are mentions of stopping meds (""I'm stopping all my meds today"") and unhealthy behaviors (""Soda and junk will kill me faster,"" ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid""), which could imply indirect self-harm. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" isn't used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon""). This qualifies as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? There are hints of potential self-harm through stopping meds and relying on unhealthy habits, but these are not specific suicide methods (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or lethal substances like pills for overdose). ""Stopping all my meds today"" could be seen as preparation, but it's not explicitly a suicide plan. Since it's uncertain if this constitutes a clear plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., stopping meds today and hoping for death soon), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of wanting to die, fitting 'ideation' as there are no specific plans or methods detailed. It goes beyond general distress but doesn't meet the criteria for 'behavior' due to lack of explicit planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses a desire to ""disappear"" and mentions ""the broken remainings of my soul"" to be free from pain. This indicates emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""want to disappear"" is vague and could imply a desire to not exist, it is not a direct expression. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no mention of any plans, so if it were to be considered for a higher category, it would not qualify.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings (e.g., ""I just want""), not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best as 'Indicator' because it does not explicitly express suicidal thoughts, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" and ""a plan for suicide""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, as the user questions the reasons not to end their life. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances mentioned). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""a plan for suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user directly questions why they shouldn't end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. The user only states ""I just need a plan for suicide,"" which expresses a desire for a plan but does not describe or indicate any actual preparation. Since this is not explicit planning, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., needing a plan), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as it involves suicidal feelings without detailed planning. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Behavior' due to no specific plan, or 'Attempt' due to no reference to past actions.

I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include phrases like ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (referring to a past failed attempt), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly,"" and simulating a gun in the mouth to pretend blowing brains out. There are mentions of death and suicide through ""kill myself"" and the failed attempt. Emotional indicators include feelings of uncontrollability, seeking relatability, and distress. There are references to a past suicide attempt but no specific plans, methods, or preparations for future actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I'm going to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the same phrase and references to self-harm and the past attempt.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, or substances. The simulation with a finger gun is not a real plan or preparation. Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to both past events (the ""most recent failed attempt"") and current/future intentions (e.g., saying ""I'm going to kill myself"" uncontrollably). It describes ongoing thoughts and behaviors tied to a historical attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions a past failed attempt, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it includes current suicidal thoughts and expressions that could imply intentions, and per the definition, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans (even if vague), it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. Although there's no specific plan as defined in 'Behavior', the combination of past action and current expressions fits 'Attempt' over 'Ideation'.

The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of profound loneliness, isolation, and emotional distress, such as the loss of a best friend, lack of support from other friends, difficulties in college (e.g., being robbed of a place to stay, not making friends, and feeling stuck at home), and a general sense of hopelessness and torment.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I'd rather kill myself now,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die. There are also expressions of not wanting to continue living, such as ""I don't want it"" in reference to their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. It's a general statement about suicide without elaboration, so this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing feelings of distress (e.g., ""just today I realised,"" ""I started college this year""), with the suicide mention implying immediate or future intentions (""I'd rather kill myself now""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill oneself), which fits the definition of Ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""blow my brains out""), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category as it involves explicit planning (e.g., a method like a gun).

My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

My family always says its because she sees me as 'weak' because i was scared of dogs when we first got her. That makes me feel like absolute shit and its all i can think of every time this happens. Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her. I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this. I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them, to a clueless little dog. I want to die. I want to disappear. I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's frustration and anger towards their dog, feelings of self-loathing (e.g., ""I know I'm a piece of shit""), emotional distress from family comments, an incident where the user screamed and threatened the dog, and explicit expressions of wanting to die and disappear. There are mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""one day I will take myself away""), indicating hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I will take myself away""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes. The language is clear and direct.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. The user mentions ""if not tonight one day I will take myself away,"" which suggests a vague future intention but lacks any explicit plan, so I lean towards 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a recent event (tonight's incident with the dog) and expresses current feelings of distress with future intentions (e.g., ""one day I will take myself away""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), which qualifies as 'ideation'. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not reach 'behavior'. It is not about a past attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply. Overall, the best fit is 'ideation'.

I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of worthlessness (""I feel like trash""), a lack of purpose (""I don't have any purpose in life""), and a desire not to exist (""I just don't want to exist""). It mentions emotional distress from lockdown, online studying, anxiety attacks, and general dissatisfaction with life. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but the user explicitly denies being suicidal.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: The phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" could imply a vague feeling about not being alive, but the user immediately clarifies ""I'm not suicidal or something"" and states that suicide is selfish. No explicit suicide references.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, anxiety, and disappointment.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, it is denied (""I'm not suicidal or something"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? There is a vague expression (""I just don't want to exist""), but it is not direct and is contradicted by the denial. Given the rules, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's no indication of any plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past events like the lockdown and anxiety attacks, and current feelings of distress, but no future intentions or plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die, as required for 'ideation'. The user explicitly denies suicidal thoughts, and the vague phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" does not constitute an explicit expression. According to the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because there are no direct suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There are no plans or past attempts, so 'behavior' or 'attempt' do not apply.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death, dying, and suicide explicitly (e.g., ""I want to take my life,"" ""I attempted suicide last week""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, worthlessness, and despair (e.g., ""I don't truly want besides death,"" ""back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness""). There are no specific plans or methods for current suicide, but it references a past attempt. No mentions of self-harm beyond the past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I want to take my life,"" ""I am suicidal"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I don't truly want besides death,"" ""The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, plans, or preparations for current actions are described; only a vague past attempt is referenced (e.g., ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note""). Since there's no explicit current plan, this leans toward ideation for current thoughts, but the past attempt is key.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""I attempted suicide last week"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing desires to take one's life), but the past attempt is explicitly detailed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (""I attempted suicide last week""), which fits the 'Attempt' category as it focuses on historic actions. Although there are current suicidal thoughts, the presence of a described past attempt takes precedence per the definitions. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Ideation' due to the lack of current plans, or 'Behavior' due to no current explicit planning.

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill you"" in the context of Valium, implying a substance for potential overdose, which relates to death and self-harm. Emotional indicators include fear and hopelessness, as seen in ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" and ""I just want this nightmare to end,"" suggesting despair and a desire for the suffering to stop.
   - There are no explicit references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, phrases like ""How much Valium does it take to kill you?"" and ""I just want this nightmare to end"" imply a desire to end life, though not with the exact words.
   - Since it's not entirely explicit but leans toward indication, I would normally lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the context strongly suggests suicidal intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, Valium is specified as a substance that could be used to cause death.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the statement ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" implies that the person has already taken some Valium, indicating action toward self-harm.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the mention of a specific method and implied action makes it clear.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a current or ongoing situation (""I haven't taken enough""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die and mentions a specific method (Valium) with implied preparation (having taken some). This fits 'Behavior' as it involves suicidal thoughts plus a plan or action, per the definitions. It's not 'Indicator' due to the clear suicidal implications, not 'Ideation' because of the specific method, and not 'Attempt' since it's not about a past event.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of not wanting to live, references to multiple past incidents of cheating death, and explicit descriptions of past suicide attempts. There are mentions of death and dying, such as surviving accidents and attempts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, as seen in phrases like ""I don't want to live at all"" and repeated references to narrowly escaping death. Specific plans and methods are described in past attempts, such as buying and swallowing sleeping pills, writing a suicide note, using a straight razor to cut the neck, and taking prescriptions. There are also references to past attempts, detailing events at age 16 and in November 2020.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states ""Some of these are suicide attempts"" and describes them in detail. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I don't want to live at all.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned in the context of past attempts, such as buying Unisom pills, swallowing them, writing a suicide note, using a straight razor, and taking prescriptions. Signs of preparation include purchasing pills and preparing the razor. These are all related to past events, not current plans. Since no current plans are indicated, this does not elevate to 'behavior' for ongoing actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events, including suicide attempts at age 16 and in November 2020, as well as a recent motorcycle accident. There are current expressions of not wanting to live, but no indications of future intentions or plans; it's reflective on past experiences.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, such as taking pills and cutting, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category focused on historic actions. While there are current expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I don't want to live at all""), there are no mentions of current plans, so it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior'. It is not 'Ideation' because the primary content is about actual past attempts, not just thoughts. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions of suicide attempts. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of personal failures such as liver pain from alcoholism, marital issues (wife wanting a divorce and threatening to ruin his life), business struggles, and overall stress leading to despair. There are explicit mentions of death and suicide, such as ""Tell me why I shouldn't kill myself"" and ""I'm ready to be done."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, stress, and readiness to end life. Specific plans or methods are referenced, like putting a belt around the neck and nearly passing out. There is also a reference to a recent action that could be seen as a self-harm attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as in ""Tell me why I shouldn't kill myself"" and descriptions of wanting to end it. There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (Yes), such as ""I'm ready to be done"" and ""I'm so close to just doing it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), including using a belt around the neck as a form of strangulation. Signs of preparation are present, as the user describes taking action by putting the belt on and sitting down. This goes beyond ideation, indicating behavior, but since it describes an action that occurred, it aligns with an attempt.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a very recent event (""tonight"" when the user put the belt around their neck and stopped before passing out), which is a past action. It also expresses current and future intentions, like ""I'm so close to just doing it,"" combining past behavior with ongoing thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past action (putting the belt around the neck and nearly passing out), which qualifies as a suicide attempt. It also mentions current suicidal thoughts and inclinations, which, per the rules, means it should be classified as 'attempt' when past attempts are referenced alongside current plans. This fits 'attempt' over 'behavior' because the primary focus is on the described past action, even though it's recent.

   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide is illegal here,"" which directly reference suicide. Emotional indicators include ""scared,"" ""too tired of life,"" and ""fun"" (sarcastically, suggesting despair). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""suicide is illegal here.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as ""too tired of life"" implies a desire to end one's existence.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme anger, frustration, and hopelessness about life, society, government, and the meaninglessness of existence. It mentions general concepts of dying and decay, such as ""We start dying the second we are born,"" and includes a statement about this being the ""second to last post"" followed by ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" Emotional indicators include despair, dissatisfaction, and a sense of slavery to life. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, or past attempts, but the phrase ""to end this bullshit for good"" implies a plan to end one's life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to end life, such as ""to end this bullshit for good,"" which strongly indicates suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""This isn't fucking living"" and the plan to end it.
   - Since it's not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit, I'll note it as an indicator of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, substances, or methods are detailed, but ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" suggests a planned action with a timeline, possibly involving a location.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the mention of this being the ""second to last post"" implies preparation, and the trip indicates a future-oriented plan.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the plan is evident enough to suggest explicit preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., the trip in April), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') by explicitly expressing a desire to end life and mentioning a plan (trip in April), which aligns with 'Behavior.' It includes suicidal thoughts plus a form of preparation, even if the method isn't detailed. Therefore, it fits 'Behavior' as it involves explicit planning with a timeline and action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions feelings of hopelessness, lack of motivation, isolation, and explicit wishes for harm, such as ""get hit by a car or od on meds."" There are references to death and dying through these phrases, indicating despair and emotional distress. No specific preparations or past attempts are noted.
   - Emotional indicators: Phrases like ""no motivation to even get up in the morning,"" ""i have no one left to turn to,"" and ""i don't feel like anything anymore it's just blank"" show deep hopelessness and emotional numbness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"" are specific methods mentioned, implying ways to end one's life.
   - References to past attempts: None are present; this appears to be about current feelings.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through indirect but clear expressions like wishing to ""get hit by a car or od on meds,"" which indicate a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user expresses wishes for fatal events.
   - The content is not unclear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""get hit by a car"" (method involving a vehicle) and ""od on meds"" (overdose on medications) are specified.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs like acquiring means or writing notes, but the mention of methods qualifies as specific ideas.
   - Since specific methods are mentioned, this aligns with the rule to classify as 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. No historical attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific methods (""get hit by a car or od on meds""), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves mentions of plans or methods. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the specificity, and there's no indication of a past attempt.

Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair about life based on physical appearance, but there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general life dissatisfaction but does not include any explicit desires to end one's life. Since it's unclear and leans toward no explicit mention, I choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of being suicidal, past attempts to kill oneself (specifically ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times""), experiences of abuse, severe mental illness, and frustration with others' ignorance. There are emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness, such as feeling tired of people's ignorance. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. References to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""me being suicidal"" and ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the reference to past suicidal actions, though it's not focused on current desires.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no explicit planning is present, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to past events, specifically past suicide attempts (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times""). There are no indications of current or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past attempts at suicide, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. It focuses on historic actions rather than current thoughts or plans. There is no mention of ongoing ideation without plans (which would be 'Ideation') or current planning (which would be 'Behavior'). Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit.

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a contrast between common advice about removing sources of sadness and the user's own statement, ""i'm better off dead."" This phrase implies a desire to not be alive. Emotional indicators include sarcasm or irony, as suggested by the "":D"" emoji, which may mask underlying distress or hopelessness. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts related to suicide or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""i'm better off dead"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive. Since this is a clear indicator of suicidal thoughts, I will not lean toward 'indicator' despite the lack of the word ""suicide.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no mention of any plan, method, or preparation, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current expressions or thoughts (e.g., ""when i say i'm better off dead""), rather than past events. There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die (""i'm better off dead""), which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without any specific plan. It is not 'indicator' because of the direct expression of a desire to not be alive. It is not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and it is not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a description of taking 44 paracetamol (an overdose), physical symptoms like stomach pain, sweating, and shaking, a feeling of being a burden, and a request for help on survival. There are mentions of self-harm through the overdose, emotional indicators of distress and regret (e.g., ""I feel like a burden"" and ""I did this to myself""), and no references to specific future plans or past attempts beyond this recent action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user describes an overdose, which is a common method of suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Partially; they say ""I don't think I want to die,"" but the action of overdosing implies suicidal intent. Since the overdose is explicitly described, this leans toward confirmation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (taking 44 paracetamol). There are signs of preparation, as the user has already ingested the substance. However, this is not about future planning but a completed action, so it doesn't fit neatly into 'behavior' alone.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a recent event (""almost an hour ago""), indicating a past action rather than current or future intentions. No other past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action (overdose) that has already occurred, fitting the definition of 'Attempt' as it involves a historic action. Even though the user expresses uncertainty about wanting to die, the overdose qualifies as a past attempt. Based on the rules, this takes precedence over 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'.

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to end one's life, as indicated by ""I want to end it"" repeated twice. This suggests a desire related to death or dying. Emotional indicators include despair or hopelessness, as the user expresses a strong wish to terminate their existence. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, there are direct expressions of wanting to die, as ""I want to end it"" implies a desire to not be alive. Since this is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts, even if not using the exact term, it leans toward being explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" indicating no plans, methods, or signs of preparation. Since there is no evidence of a plan, this would not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions, as the language is in the present tense (""I want to end it""), with no reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to end it) but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation', as it involves a desire to not be alive without details on how to act on it. There is no mention of past attempts, so 'Attempt' does not apply, and it goes beyond general distress, so 'Indicator' is not the best fit. 'Behavior' requires a plan, which is absent.

I'm really trying but it feels completely hopeless bc I know I should be fine. but I'm just not.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional exhaustion, frustration with a cycle of highs and lows, feeling like a robot, overwhelming emotions, a desire for someone to care or listen, and a sense of hopelessness about enjoying life. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, exhaustion, and dissatisfaction with life, but nothing explicitly ties to suicidal thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there is general distress and hopelessness, such as ""I can't handle it anymore"" and ""it feels completely hopeless."" Since it's not explicit and leans toward vague dissatisfaction, I am leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any plans. Thus, there's no basis for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and a past posting (a year ago), but it does not describe any past attempts or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' as it involves dissatisfaction with life without explicit suicidal expressions. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user discovering they have bipolar disorder, reflecting on its impact on their life, mentioning past struggles like depression, bipolar mental breakdowns, almost being abusive, and physical symptoms like puking daily for nearly 2 years. They express current improvement, being in therapy, feelings of loneliness and manipulation tendencies, but also acceptance and hope for the future. Emotional indicators include past hopelessness (e.g., ""rock bottom"") and current positivity. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm beyond a vague reference to ""nothing lower but death"" in the context of hitting rock bottom. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the reference to ""nothing lower but death"" is vague and not a personal desire, but a general statement. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plan or method, so no need to consider 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to past events (e.g., rock bottom with depression and breakdowns) and current positive feelings, with no mention of future intentions or past attempts at suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes general distress and past emotional struggles but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. The vague phrase about death does not qualify as explicit suicidal thoughts, and per the rules, I should choose 'indicator' when in doubt. Thus, it fits best as 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to end one's life (""plan on ending it soon""), emotional indicators like overwhelming guilt and despair about family reactions, and a specific method mentioned (overdosing on ibuprofen). There are no references to past attempts or self-harm beyond the planned action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""ending it soon"" and the context of planning an overdose. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user expresses a desire to end their life due to guilt.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user specifies overdosing on ibuprofen as their ""go-to plan."" Are there signs of preparation? There is mention of a method and timing (e.g., tonight or this week), but no explicit details like acquiring means. Since a specific method is identified, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""soon,"" ""tonight or this week""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (overdosing on ibuprofen), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of a method, and there are no past attempts, so it's not 'attempt.' It's not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly implied and planned.

I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of relapse into an addiction, feelings of shame and worthlessness (""I feel like shit""), explicit thoughts of suicide (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself""), and expressions of hopelessness about the future (""right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future""). There are no direct references to self-harm, past attempts, or specific preparations.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through the user's description of their ongoing struggles and belief that some people are ""meant to be fucked up.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method is mentioned (""If I had a gun""), but there are no signs of actual preparations like acquiring a gun or writing a note.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states, ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement expresses a desire to end their life.
   - The mention is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a gun is specifically mentioned as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the statement is conditional (""If I had a gun""), indicating no current preparations.
   - Although it's not a full plan with preparations, the mention of a specific method (gun) aligns with the criteria for considering it beyond just ideation, as per the definitions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., worsening feelings), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (gun), which fits the 'Behavior' category as it involves suicidal thoughts plus a reference to a means of suicide. Although it's conditional, the definitions specify that mentioning specific ideas of how to commit suicide should be classified as 'Behavior'. If there were no method mentioned, it might be 'Ideation', but here it crosses that threshold.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and a plan to kill oneself, such as ""I've got a suicide plan,"" ""how I can kill myself,"" and ""I plan on doing it next week."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""worthless existence"" and ""these past years have shit."" There are no specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) detailed, but a plan is implied. No references to past attempts or self-harm are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicide plan"" and ""kill myself.""

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, implied through the planned timing and having thought it over, but not explicitly detailed.
   - Since a plan is mentioned, even briefly, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions, specifically planning for next week. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a plan (e.g., ""how I can kill myself"" and ""doing it next week""), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond just ideation by including planning elements, even if not fully detailed. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses a history of depression, suicidal thoughts, and a past suicide attempt (many years ago). It mentions current suicidal thoughts due to chronic medical issues and pain, but focuses on seeking help and emotional struggles rather than active intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and feelings of worthlessness. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to ongoing self-harm.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and a past attempt.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, the user explicitly states they have attempted suicide in the past.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post mentions suicidal thoughts and a past attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through references to current suicidal thoughts.
   - The mentions are explicit, so this leans toward a category beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no evidence of planning, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past suicide attempt and current suicidal thoughts, but not to future intentions or plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user describes having attempted suicide many years ago.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Although current suicidal thoughts are mentioned, there are no specific plans, so it does not fit 'Behavior' or 'Ideation' as the primary focus. The definition of 'Attempt' emphasizes historic actions, and this post qualifies due to the clear description of a past attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include feelings of not being a person, difficulty socializing, pushing away loved ones like the boyfriend, fear of abandonment, suffering from issues, not opening up about depression and thoughts of sh (self-harm), inability to cope through cutting due to visibility, and overall overwhelm. 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There is a reference to ""thoughts of sh,"" which likely means self-harm, and mentions of depression, but no explicit references to death, dying, or suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, isolation, fear, and general dissatisfaction with life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans or methods for suicide are mentioned; only a mention of not being able to engage in self-harm (cutting) as a coping mechanism.
   - References to past attempts: None are present.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; while there are expressions of distress and thoughts of self-harm, there is no direct statement of a desire to die.
   - Since it is unclear if this constitutes explicit suicidal thoughts, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No; only thoughts of self-harm are referenced, but not as a method for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs, such as acquiring tools or writing notes.
   - If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, there is no indication of any plan, so it does not reach 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and ongoing thoughts (e.g., current depression and thoughts of sh), not past events or future intentions.
   - No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and thoughts of self-harm, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because it lacks explicit expressions concerning suicide. Even with mentions of self-harm and depression, the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through phrases like ""I don't want to live"" and ""goodbye.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? ""Take the leap"" might suggest jumping, but it is metaphorical and not explicit (e.g., no details on tools, locations, or substances). There are no signs of preparation mentioned. Since it's unclear if this constitutes an explicit plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or preparations. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing a method or steps. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, 'Behavior' due to no clear plan, or 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

116,"Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all. Playing witcher 3 before i call it quits. Honestly, i feel so relaxed that it's finally ending. 22 years on this earth was enough for me. Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include phrases like ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" ""it's finally ending,"" and ""22 years on this earth was enough for me,"" which suggest a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include feelings of relaxation about the end, reflection on enjoyable past years contrasted with a bad recent year, and a farewell message (""Goodbye and goodluck""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly by name, no specific plans or methods (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances), and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but phrases like ""end it all"" and ""call it quits"" imply a desire to die. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"" and the overall tone of finality.
   - Since there are indirect but clear expressions, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out the act.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of playing a video game ""one last time"" could hint at a final act, but it does not constitute explicit preparation like acquiring means or writing a note. Thus, this is not sufficient for 'behavior,' so I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., playing the game before ending it), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'ideation.' It is not 'indicator' due to the clear expressions of wanting to die, not 'behavior' due to no explicit plan, and not 'attempt' as it does not describe past actions.

117,I need help. So I met this person on reddit who I am sort of friends with. But She wrote three days ago that she had tried to kill herself and she is now on restrictions at home. She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of concern and fear for another person who reportedly attempted suicide three days ago. There are mentions of death or suicide (e.g., ""tried to kill herself""), but these refer to the other person, not the poster. Emotional indicators include the poster's fear and worry (e.g., ""I'm scared""), but there are no signs of the poster's own hopelessness, despair, or suicidal thoughts. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to the poster's past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but it pertains to another person, not the poster. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die from the poster? No. Since the mentions are not about the poster, and the rules specify focusing on the person writing the post, this does not qualify as explicit for the poster. In cases of doubt, lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, and certainly not for the poster. Are there signs of preparation? None for the poster. If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's no uncertainty as nothing relates to the poster.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (the other person's attempt three days ago) and current concern (e.g., lack of response). It does not describe any past, current, or future intentions related to the poster's own suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress about someone else but lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts by the poster. Based on the rules, we only consider the poster's own risk, and there are no indicators of the poster's suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempts. This fits best under 'Indicator', as it involves expressions of distress without direct mention of the poster's suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions suicide explicitly (""I will hang myself now""), self-harm (""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., being alone since age 5, bullying, no friends, fear of going out, feeling used and made fun of). It also describes a specific method (hanging) and preparations (looking for something to tie that will kill). There are references to past self-harm but not full past suicide attempts.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, ""I will hang myself now"" and references to something that will kill.
   - Emotional indicators: Yes, hopelessness from isolation and bullying.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, method of hanging and current action of looking for an item to tie.
   - References to past attempts: Indirectly through self-harm, but not a full suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I will hang myself now.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied in the context of wanting to end loneliness through suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging as the method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it,"" and confidence it won't break due to weight.
   - This is explicit planning, so it qualifies as more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past events (e.g., bullying since age 5, past self-harm) but focuses on current intentions (e.g., ""I will hang myself now"" and immediate preparations).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No full past attempts are described, only past self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (hanging) with preparations, which fits the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond ideation due to the mention of methods and actions being taken now.

119,"I feel so shattered. I don't even know any more. I just feel shitty. There is no rhyme or reason. It's not even that I just want to die. I only feel just so very miserable (not sure if that is the right word to describe it) nothing more, nothing less, and it sucks. I can barely function. I don't even know how to just live anymore. It feels like I am being ripped apart and put back together incorrectly. I can't stop shaking. How am I supposed to live like this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as feeling shattered, shitty, miserable, unable to function, being ripped apart, shaking, and questioning how to live. There is a mention of ""I just want to die,"" but it is negated with ""It's not even that."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and general dissatisfaction with life. No mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, because while the phrase ""I just want to die"" is referenced, it is immediately denied (""It's not even that""), making it not a direct expression of suicidal thoughts. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as the post explicitly states it is not the case.
   - Since this is unclear and leans toward not being explicit, I will choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and emotions, with no mention of past events or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, as the potential reference to wanting to die is negated. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because there is no direct expression of a desire to die or commit suicide. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

People could say stuff like: well, start your own company. you don't get it. I want out now. In the beginning I thought: well, I should just work harder and I kept up with my work through self research because they don't have time. Well, how did they thank me? By giving me more. I can't handle it and when I say something about it, they respond with: well, the works keep coming. yeah, it is not my fault they organized themselves like trash. I am a hard worker but now I just don't see the need. Tf is this life? I want out.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme job dissatisfaction, overwork, lack of support, and frustration with life. There are mentions of wanting to ""kill myself"" and ""I want out,"" which directly reference suicide and a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as seen in phrases like ""Hate this rat race,"" ""I can't handle it,"" ""Tf is this life? I want out."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I just want to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through statements like ""I want out now"" and ""I want out."" This is clear and not vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is indicated, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current frustrations and intentions, with no mention of past events or attempts. It focuses on the present state of mind.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I just want to kill myself""), which qualifies it as more than just an indicator. However, there is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not reach the level of behavior. It best fits ideation, as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing any concrete actions.

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""I WANT TO DOIE,"" which likely means ""I WANT TO DIE""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., depression, lack of purpose, self-hate, and viewing suicidal thoughts as a cope), and specific plans or methods (e.g., using extension ladders, isolated wire cutters, making nitroglycerin at home, targeting power plants). There are no clear references to past attempts; it's focused on current thoughts and potential actions.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I WANT TO DOIE"" and references to suicidal thoughts as a cope.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with ""I WANT TO DOIE"" and encouragement to ""go out with a bang.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, such as extension ladders, wire cutters, making nitroglycerin, and targeting power plants, which indicate potential means for self-harm or suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post suggests researching and acquiring materials (e.g., learning how to make nitroglycerin and finding parts cheaply).
   - Since specific methods are described, this goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""If you change your mind,"" ""Learn how,"" ""Take a vacation""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die) and specific plans (e.g., methods and preparations), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It exceeds 'Ideation' due to the mention of concrete methods, and there are no past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'. It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now.

She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself.

With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include descriptions of severe bullying and harassment directed at the user's best friend, such as the bully telling the friend to ""go kill yourself,"" making threats, creating fake images, and using multiple accounts. Emotional indicators include the friend being mentally disturbed, tired, not eating, overwhelmed, and feeling unable to stand up for herself. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm from the user themselves. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present in the post.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in the context of the bully's words directed at the friend (""go kill yourself""). This is not an expression from the user. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive from the user? No. The post focuses on the friend's situation, and the rules specify that the suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, which is the user. Since the user does not mention any suicidal thoughts or feelings, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. The post does not contain any details about plans or methods related to suicide for the user.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to ongoing events (the bullying over the past 5 days) and seeks advice for action, but there are no references to past, current, or future suicidal intentions from the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts from the user. It describes distress related to the friend's situation, which qualifies as general dissatisfaction or emotional indicators, but without any mention of the user's own suicide risk. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as there are no direct suicidal expressions from the person writing the post. When in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over other categories.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of suicide (""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad""), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, isolation, mental illness, and a desire for a normal life. It expresses feelings of being a loser, ugly, lacking motivation, and having nothing to look forward to. A specific method is mentioned: hanging. No references to past attempts or explicit preparations are noted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicide is on my mind everyday"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I want to hang myself so bad,"" which specifies hanging as a method).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring tools or writing a note.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this indicates planning, so it aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings and intentions (e.g., ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and directly mentions a specific method (hanging), which constitutes a plan. This fits the 'behavior' category, as it includes both suicidal ideation and an explicit plan without requiring further preparations. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, 'ideation' because of the specific method, or 'attempt' since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of past suicide attempts (""last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?""), current desires to attempt again (""still want to attempt again""), and a temporary decision to live (""but I found one thing to live for so I guess ill stay alive""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and regret (""still alive unfortunately""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools or locations. References to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the word ""attempted"" in the context of suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""still alive unfortunately"" and ""still want to attempt again.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are described. Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation, but the presence of past attempts influences the overall category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to past events (e.g., ""last night I attempted once again"" and multiple prior attempts) and current intentions (e.g., ""still want to attempt again""). The post describes concrete past actions rather than just thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which fits the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current desires, and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans (even if not fully detailed), it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit over 'Ideation', as the primary content centers on historical actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme distress, including feelings of hopelessness (""Everything's crumbling and I don't see a reason""), physical sensations (""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting""), fear of going through with something (""I'm still too scared to go all the way through""), and a desire for connection (""I want nothing more than someone to sit with me""). It references past experiences (""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"") and a subtle hope of not surviving (""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"").
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of suicide, but indirect references to dying through phrases like ""I hope I don't wake up"" and implying a past action that could be self-harm or an attempt.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, sadness, fear, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned; no details on tools, locations, or methods.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, implied in ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up,"" suggesting previous unsuccessful attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through ""I hope I don't wake up,"" which indicates a desire to die.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is somewhat unclear, but the expression of wanting not to wake up qualifies as an explicit suicidal thought.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No; no tools, substances, or locations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of preparation like notes or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is evident, it does not reach 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and emotions but explicitly mentions past events (""as I've done this before""), indicating previous attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, indirectly through the reference to past actions that didn't succeed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., hoping not to wake up), which could suggest 'ideation'. However, it also describes past attempts (""as I've done this before""), which aligns with the 'attempt' category. According to the definitions, content that describes past attempts qualifies as 'attempt', even if current thoughts are present. There are no specific plans mentioned, so it doesn't fit 'behavior'. Therefore, 'attempt' is the best fit due to the reference to historic actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of intent to kill oneself, a loaded gun as a method, preparations like having an empty room and no savings, emotional indicators of hopelessness and regret, and a farewell message. There are references to past intentions (writing since June with intent to kill oneself but never acting on it), but no actual past attempts described. The post expresses despair, a desire to die, and specific plans for suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""intent to kill myself"" and ""I am going to shoot myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as stating they have run out of chances and are ready to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, swallowing bleach. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, leaving a note. Since this is about a past event, it involves explicit planning and action, but for classification, we focus on the description provided.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This primarily refers to past events (a week ago), including a specific attempt. There are no clear current or future intentions mentioned, though the user notes ongoing feelings; the focus is historical.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete past suicide attempt, including actions like swallowing bleach and leaving a note, which fits the 'Attempt' category. It does not primarily involve current plans, so it's not 'Behavior'. There are no ongoing explicit suicidal thoughts without past action, so it's not 'Ideation'. It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit details of the attempt.

128,"The only reason I'm alive is cause my parents are still alive. Long story short, I lost my sibling this year and ever since my anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse. After the funeral I basically lost all will to live. But I tried to pull through and find things to do to occupy my time. I thought I was getting better and moving on but I realise when I stop doing everything and sit alone, I still want to die. The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child :/ please help",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the loss of a sibling, worsening anxiety and depression, losing the will to live, and a current desire to die. There are mentions of wanting to die and emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post directly states ""I still want to die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I lost all will to live"" and ""I still want to die.""
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is indicated, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events (loss of sibling and funeral) but focuses on current feelings (""I still want to die""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die), which fits 'ideation' as there is no specific plan mentioned. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' without a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" and ""my end will only get nearer,"" which directly reference suicide and thoughts of death. Emotional indicators include expressions of being in the ""deepest depths"" and ""darkest corners,"" suggesting hopelessness and despair. There are no mentions of self-harm or specific preparations. The post discusses using LSD as a coping mechanism, with outcomes that could lead to worsening state, but it doesn't detail suicide methods.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""thinking of suicide for months on end.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through phrases like ""my end will only get nearer"" and acceptance of negative outcomes.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, substances for suicide) are detailed; LSD is mentioned as a potential help, not as a suicide plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months"") and potential future outcomes (if LSD doesn't help), but not past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ongoing thoughts of suicide and acceptance of death), but lacks any specific plan or method for suicide. This aligns with 'Ideation' as it involves desires related to suicide without detailed planning. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress, such as hitting a new low and not feeling okay for a while, indicating hopelessness and uncertainty. There are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The user describes stealing their dog's hydrocodone and drinking alcohol to feel okay, which suggests risky behavior but not explicitly tied to suicide. No specific plans, methods, preparations for suicide, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The content focuses on coping with distress through substances, but lacks any explicit suicidal language. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Hydrocodone and alcohol are mentioned, which could be risky, but not in the context of a suicide plan—they're described as ways to feel okay. There are no signs of preparation for suicide. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it doesn't meet the threshold for a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current events (actions taken tonight), with no mention of past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general distress and risky behavior but lacks any explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best as 'Indicator' since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' when in doubt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""I see no point in living anymore,"" ""I don't have any friends,"" and ""Nothing in my life is working out."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and general dissatisfaction with life, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" implies a vague dissatisfaction with life, but it is not a direct expression of wanting to die. Since this is unclear and not very explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of any plan, this does not factor into a higher category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions, as it is in the present tense (e.g., ""I see no point""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' because there is no direct or explicit expression concerning suicide, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user expressing guilt and regret that their friend discovered their issues. They mention taking ""a fuck load of pills"" and the possibility of not waking up tomorrow, which implies a potential overdose. Emotional indicators include feelings of guilt, hopelessness, and a sense that their problems burden others. There are mentions of self-harm through the pill ingestion, and it suggests a method (pills) that could lead to death. No references to past attempts are present; this seems focused on a recent or current action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of taking pills and the implication of not waking up. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user states they might not wake up, indicating a desire for the outcome of their action.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a fuck load of pills,"" which is a method for overdose. Are there signs of preparation? The post implies the action has already been taken, suggesting preparation or execution rather than just planning. Since this describes an action, it goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a recent or current event (e.g., ""taken a fuck load of pills""), with future implications (""might not wake up tomorrow""). It does not describe past attempts but focuses on what has just happened.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action (ingesting pills) that constitutes an attempt at suicide. Based on the definitions, this fits ""Attempt"" because it involves a past or recent concrete action. Even if it hints at current effects, the primary description is of an action taken, aligning with the category for historic actions in the context of the post.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""planning out my suicide,"" ""suicidal thoughts""), death (desire to end life), and self-harm (fear of failing an attempt). Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair (""I'm tired of the constant struggle,"" ""can't find a reason to continue living""). There are references to a specific plan (""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st""), preparations implied through planning, and a past attempt (""fear of failing an attempt once again"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I will go through with this,"" ""can't find a reason to continue living"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not mentioned (no tools, substances, or locations detailed). There are signs of preparation through the stated plan and timeline (""planning out my suicide"" and ""intention by January 1st""). Since the plan is explicit but methods are not detailed, this leans toward 'behavior' if planning is evident, but I must consider the overall context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to future intentions (e.g., ""I have an intention in the beginning of the new year"") and a past attempt (""fear of failing an attempt once again"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts, a plan (timeline and intention), and a reference to a past attempt. According to the definitions, since it mentions past attempts and also current plans, the rule specifies to label it as 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of not wanting to live anymore, being scared to kill oneself, hating being alive, not wanting to burden family and friends, wondering about doing it now to avoid hurting them more later, and wishing they were never born. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""kill myself"" and ""do it now""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""I hate being alive,"" and ""kill myself"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no explicit plan, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and vague future intentions (e.g., ""do it now"" or ""if I wait for later""), but not to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (e.g., ""kill myself""), which goes beyond general distress and fits the definition of ideation. However, there is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as behavior. There are no references to past attempts, so attempt is not applicable. Therefore, the best category is ideation.

135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide attempts, self-harm through hanging, and a safety measure to prevent death. Emotional indicators are minimal, but there's a description of frequent behavior. Specific plans or methods: Hanging is mentioned as the method, with preparations like leaving a chair or elevated object. References to past attempts: Yes, the user states they ""attempt suicide frequently"" and describes the actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Partially, as they describe attempts but with intent not to die. This is explicit enough to go beyond mere indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging with a safety mechanism. Signs of preparation? Yes, by ensuring an object is available to stand on. This involves explicit planning and actions, so it leans toward behavior or attempt rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to past and possibly ongoing events, as the user says they ""attempt suicide frequently"" and describes repeated actions. Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes concrete past actions of attempting suicide (e.g., hanging themselves), which fits the ""Attempt"" category. It involves actual events rather than just thoughts or plans, and the rules specify that descriptions of past attempts classify as ""Attempt.""

I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left.

No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. References to past attempts are present, including the attempt at age 14 and ""a few close calls.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the user states ""I've been suicidal"" and describes a past attempt. There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not go on (Yes), such as ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, or signs of preparation are mentioned. Therefore, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events, specifically the suicide attempt at age 14 and close calls. It also includes current feelings of despair, but no indications of future intentions or plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""I had an attempt when I was 14""), which fits the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. Although there are current suicidal thoughts, the presence of a described past attempt takes precedence per the definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post starts with ""I am 29 still live with my parents,"" which expresses general dissatisfaction with life circumstances. The rest appears to be random keyboard smashing or gibberish, such as ""4kdjejdne sjdjd fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo."" In this, ""fuckkkkkkkk"" indicates frustration or anger, and ""didie"" might vaguely suggest ""die,"" but it's not clear or explicit. There are no clear mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No emotional indicators of hopelessness beyond general discontent, and no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, as any potential reference in the gibberish (e.g., ""didie"") is unclear and not explicit. Following the instructions, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' when unclear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since nothing is certain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if needed, but this doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to the current situation (e.g., living with parents at 29), not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general dissatisfaction but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it involves distress without explicit suicidal content, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of intent to die, such as ""I'll finally do it,"" references to past actions with ""I've done it many times,"" specific methods like ""how to properly hang myself"" and ""start cutting again,"" and a desire for death in a particular way like ""die in my sleep."" There are emotional indicators of resignation and lack of fear, such as ""I'm not afraid of killing myself anymore,"" and mentions of potential interference delaying the act.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: Yes, explicit references to ""killing myself,"" ""hang myself,"" ""die,"" and ""cutting again.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and determination, e.g., ""I'll break killing myself regardless.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" indicates a specific method, and ""start cutting again"" suggests self-harm as a means.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, ""I've done it many times"" directly implies previous suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""hang myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I'll finally do it,"" ""I just wish I could die in my sleep"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""hang myself,"" ""cutting again"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, as ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" suggests planning and knowledge of a method.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here it's clear there are specific plans.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (""I've done it many times"") and current/future intentions (""One of these days I'll finally do it,"" ""I'll break killing myself regardless"").
   - Past attempts are specifically described, indicating historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a plan, but it also directly references past attempts (""I've done it many times""). According to the definitions and rules, when a post refers to past attempts, even if it mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of distress such as not feeling alright, lack of sleep, and upcoming class, which indicate emotional strain. There are mentions of thoughts telling the person to ""end it all,"" which implies suicidal ideation, and feelings of being doomed and something worse coming if they continue existing, pointing to hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""end it all"" is a phrase that directly implies a desire to end one's life, which aligns with suicidal thoughts. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""end it all"" and ""if I kept existing,"" indicating a desire not to continue living. Since this is not unclear, it goes beyond just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""end it all"" and feelings of doom if existing continues), which fit the definition of Ideation, as there is a desire to not be alive without any specific plan or method mentioned. It is not Indicator because of the explicit suicidal language, not Behavior due to the absence of a plan, and not Attempt as no past actions are described.

I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and suicide through descriptions of past attempts (e.g., ""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-hate, depression, anxiety, and feelings of worthlessness (e.g., ""I hate myself,"" ""Why should I still live""). There are no mentions of current specific plans, methods, or preparations, but past self-harm attempts are detailed. References to past attempts are explicit.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the descriptions of past attempts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""Why should I still live"" and self-deprecating statements.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, in the context of past attempts (e.g., drowning, hanging, jumping from a building).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No current signs, as these are described as past events.
   - Since the methods are tied to past actions, not current plans, this leans toward historical behavior rather than ongoing ideation or behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to past events (e.g., ""I tried...""), with current emotional distress but no explicit current or future intentions described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Although there are elements of ideation in the current expressions of despair, the presence of described past actions (e.g., trying to drown or hang) makes 'Attempt' the best fit, as per the definition that prioritizes past attempts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past hypotheticals (e.g., at 15 years old) but not actual events, and current/future intentions (e.g., becoming more confident). No concrete past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'ideation.' It is not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'behavior' due to no plan, and not 'attempt' as no past action is confirmed.

142,Too much. Well it finally happened I got to the point where the pain is too much and the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better. I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of overwhelming pain and emotional distress, such as ""the pain is too much"" and references to hiding feelings. There are direct mentions of death and dying, specifically ""be dead in less than 24 hours."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair. Specific plans and methods are mentioned, including having ""enough Trazodone"" (a substance) and planning to get alcohol. There are no clear references to past attempts, though it hints at learning to hide feelings, which might imply prior experiences but doesn't describe them.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post states ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" in the context of the described actions. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the overall narrative of pain leading to a decision to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as Trazodone (a drug) and alcohol (a substance), which could be used for overdose. Signs of preparation include already having Trazodone and planning to acquire alcohol today. Since there is clear evidence of a plan, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions, such as getting alcohol today and being dead soon, rather than past events. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan with methods (Trazodone and alcohol) and preparations, which fits the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of concrete means and timeline.

All of the abuse and shit I've experienced is in the past, and I'm still allowing it to control me. Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives? I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of ongoing hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness. There are mentions of negative thoughts, past abuse, and a general dissatisfaction with life, such as ""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive,"" and ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and a desire to give up, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described. There are references to past struggles and abuse, but no specific references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I want to give up"" and questions like ""Why the fuck am I alive"" suggest a vague desire not to continue, but these are not direct or explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but since there's no evidence of planning at all, this doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events like childhood struggles and abuse, as well as current feelings of hopelessness. There are no references to past suicide attempts or current/future intentions involving suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, I must choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of death and dying, such as ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" and ""slowly kill myself this way."" Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, as the user expresses a desire to continue with anorexia to reach a fatal weight. Specific plans or methods are referenced, including using anorexia to lose weight to 78 pounds or lower to cause death. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""let myself pass away"" and ""for it to finally kill me.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including anorexia as a means to achieve a weight that will lead to death (e.g., goal weight of 78 pounds or lower). Signs of preparation are evident in the ongoing pursuit of weight loss as a plan. Since a method is specified, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions, such as setting a new goal weight and describing how the process will lead to death. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (using anorexia to reach a fatal weight), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not just 'Ideation' because a method is described, and not 'Attempt' as it involves current/future plans rather than past actions.

No references to past attempts or preparations are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, but the question about the method implies consideration. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this is not unclear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (charcoal BBQ in a tent). There are no signs of preparation described. However, the post includes specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/means), which aligns with explicit planning, so this fits 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a hypothetical or future possibility, not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicide and includes a specific method (charcoal BBQ in a tent), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves explicit thoughts with a plan or method. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the detailed method described.

146,"Life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it. I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, self-loathing, body image issues (being overweight and gender dysphoria as a trans man), relationship problems, and feeling like a burden to others. There are mentions of ""want to die"" and ""committing die"" (likely a typo for ""committing suicide"" or ""dying""), which indicate thoughts of death. Emotional indicators include despair, feeling everything is wrong, and believing others would be better off without the user. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""want to die"" and ""committing die,"" which directly express a desire to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user states ""want to die"" and implies others would be better without them.
   - This is clear, so it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""want to die""), which makes it more than just an 'indicator.' However, there is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.' There are no references to past attempts, so it's not 'attempt.'

We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time.

I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing, such as ""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Nothing's real to me anymore,"" ""I'm an abomination,"" and thoughts of harming others or wanting bad things to happen to oneself (e.g., ""Why do I want horrible things to happen to me?""). There are mentions of emotional pain, potential past trauma (e.g., sexual assault), and a metaphor of treating oneself like a ""sick dog"" that needs to be ""put down."" This implies a desire for ending one's life indirectly but does not explicitly mention suicide, death, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair, confusion, and a sense of invalidity. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not use words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct equivalents. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down"" is a metaphor that could imply a desire to end life, it is not direct or explicit. Given the instructions to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, this is not considered explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of self-harm. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates planning or acquiring means. If uncertain, the instructions specify choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but since no plan exists, this does not apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post primarily refers to current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""I'm tired,"" ""Why do I keep having thoughts...""), with some vague questioning about past events (e.g., possible sexual assault). There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts or actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and indirect metaphors that might suggest suicidal thoughts, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to die. The definitions emphasize that for 'ideation,' there must be explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, and when in doubt, 'indicator' should be chosen over 'ideation.' Since the language is metaphorical and not explicit (e.g., ""put down"" as a dog), it fits best under 'indicator.' There is no plan for 'behavior' or past attempt for 'attempt.'

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions suicide multiple times, such as ""the thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" and ""suicide pact.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct references to suicide and thoughts of it.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through expressions like ""the thought of suicide feels like an obligation"" and ""plotting my suicide.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly (e.g., no tools or substances detailed), but there are signs of preparation, such as ""plotting my suicide"" and ""drafted my will."" This indicates some level of planning.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, drafting a will is a preparation for suicide.
   - Since preparations are mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior,' but if uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.' However, the drafting of a will qualifies as explicit preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to ongoing and past thoughts (""on and off for months"") and a recent action (drafting a will yesterday), indicating current/future intentions rather than past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and signs of preparation (e.g., drafting a will), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation due to these preparations.

There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm by the poster. The line ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"" implies a wish for the other person's death, but this is not about the poster's own actions or desires.

I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of overwhelming life difficulties, suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, and feelings of weakness and isolation. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" ""suicidal thoughts and ideations""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, being in a rut, and having a small support system. There are no specific methods, tools, or substances mentioned, but there is a vague reference to timing (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") and possibly reaching out to contacts. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, substances, or locations beyond a vague timing (""tomorrow while my mom is out""). Are there signs of preparation? There is a mention of ""hitting up everyone in my contacts and try and go out,"" which could imply vague actions like saying goodbyes, but it's not explicit or concrete. Since it's uncertain if this constitutes a specific plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself""), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, such as ""I want to die tomorrow"" and ""I want to kill myself,"" which fit the definition of ideation. However, there is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as behavior. There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it's not attempt. It goes beyond indicator due to the explicit mentions of suicide.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and emotional distress, such as ""useless life,"" ""dead inside,"" ""still sad,"" ""anhedonic,"" ""beyond saving,"" and ""good days make me feel sad."" There are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm, except for the phrase ""yeet myself,"" which is slang that could imply a desire to throw oneself away or harm oneself, but it's vague and not explicit. Emotional indicators show deep despair and hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""yeet myself way too much"" might suggest a desire to end one's life, but it's not a direct or clear expression (e.g., not stating ""I want to die"" or ""kill myself""). Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. The post expresses general feelings but nothing that constitutes a plan. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the lack of any plan supports not escalating to 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings (e.g., ""I'm still dead inside"") and a past depressive episode, but it does not describe past attempts or specify future intentions beyond vague emotional states.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. The phrase ""yeet myself"" is ambiguous and not explicit enough to qualify as suicidal ideation. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, and when in doubt, I should choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.' There is no plan, preparation, or past attempt described, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' do not apply.

God im such a fucking loser. i could really use someone to talk too. All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all. I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration, hopelessness, and regret about life circumstances, such as potentially losing a job and license, feeling like a ""fucking loser,"" and isolation from friends. There are mentions of a past suicide attempt (""I tried to end it once before"") and a wish that it had succeeded (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded""). Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, but there are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for future self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to a past attempt and wishing it had succeeded. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the wish for the past attempt to have been successful implies a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no indications of current or future plans, this does not elevate to 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past events, specifically a previous suicide attempt, and includes reflections on it. There are no clear references to current or future intentions beyond general distress.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""I tried to end it once before""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. There are no current plans mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. While there are suicidal thoughts implied, the primary content is about the past attempt, making 'Attempt' the best fit.

There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I just wanna kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wanna kill myself"" clearly expresses a desire to end one's life.
   - This is explicit, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

   - This refers to current feelings, as indicated by ""I'm having a bad panic attack"" and ""I just wanna kill myself,"" which are in the present tense. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to kill oneself), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the 'Ideation' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and defeat, such as ""my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with,"" ""feel more and more defeated,"" ""never be out of this torture cycle,"" and ""why keep going?"" These suggest emotional indicators of despair and a desire to end suffering. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" imply a desire to end one's life. Although not crystal clear, these expressions align with explicit suicidal thoughts, so I lean toward recognizing them as such based on the definitions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ongoing defeat), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to not continue living (""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?""), but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves desires to end life without detailing how. It is not 'Indicator' because of the direct expressions of wanting to die, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of annoyance and sadness due to people mocking the user's spiritual beliefs (e.g., crystals, astrology, tarot). There are emotional indicators such as feeling stupid, getting offended easily, and crying, which suggest distress.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" implies a desire to end one's life, as it directly references suicidal ideation.
   - Since it is explicit, this supports moving beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward acting on the thoughts.

So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all?

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation like acquiring means or writing a note.

Emotional indicators include regret, embarrassment, feeling mortified, wanting to rip hair out, and general distress about mental instability and living situations.

There is a mention of suicide in the phrase ""I wont kill myself of course,"" which directly references killing oneself. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and overwhelming pain, but there are no mentions of death, dying, self-harm beyond general frustration, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post includes ""I wont kill myself,"" which directly references suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Not explicitly, but the denial implies it's a thought being addressed. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans toward Ideation rather than Indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as Behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and intentions, with no mention of past events or attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on gender identity and dysphoria without any reference to suicide or death. Since there is no explicit mention, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is nothing indicating any plan or method related to suicide, so if there were uncertainty, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clear there is none.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I want to kms,"" ""I really want to hang myself right now,"" ""killing myself,"" and a description of putting a rope around the neck and practicing hanging. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, fear of failing, feeling like a burden, and despair. There are references to specific preparations not yet completed, like packing the apartment, resigning from the job, and setting aside money, as well as the act of ""practice"" hanging.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kms,"" ""hang myself,"" ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., desires to end life and feelings of deserving it).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods mentioned? Yes (hanging with a rope).
   - Signs of preparation? Yes (putting the rope around the neck and practicing, though not fully executed, and references to intended conditions like packing up and resigning).
   - This indicates more than just thoughts, as there's evidence of attempting an action, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and immediate intentions (e.g., ""right now,"" ""trying again""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die, along with a specific method (hanging) and an exhibited behavior (practicing with the rope). This fits 'Behavior' as it includes both thoughts and signs of planning or self-harming actions. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' because of the described actions, and not 'Attempt' since it's not about a completed past event.

I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job. I've pushed my fiancé away I guess if he didn't even bother to do this for me, to care that I haven't stopped crying. I just want to fucking die. I don't want to be here any more.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die, references to suicide, emotional distress such as sobbing, hopelessness, and feelings of failure. Specific mentions include ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I'm going to go through with it,"" and ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" Emotional indicators show despair, overwhelm, and suicidal thoughts. There are no references to past attempts, but there is a mention of a potential method (gun) without clear preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with terms like ""suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" and direct statements like ""I just want to fucking die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I don't want to be here anymore"" and ""I'll die a failure.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post references ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun,"" which indicates a specific method (gun). There are no signs of preparation like acquiring the gun or writing a note, but the mention of a method qualifies as part of planning.
   - According to the definitions, since a specific idea of how to commit suicide is expressed, this leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current and future intentions, such as ""I'm finally going to actually do it"" and ""I'm going to go through with it."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (gun), which fits the 'behavior' category as it includes a plan element. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not just 'ideation' because of the method specified, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of ""end things,"" which implies suicide, and driving to the mountains with full intentions to do so. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, such as feeling alone, apathetic about existing, and a desire to escape through sleep. No specific methods like tools or substances are mentioned, but the location (mountains) could imply a potential method. There are no references to past attempts or self-harm beyond the described intention.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""full intentions to end things"" and references to not wanting to be dead.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as indicated by the intention to end things and the hope that someone doesn't want them dead.
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly (e.g., no tools or substances), but the act of driving to the mountains suggests a suitable location for suicide, which aligns with the definition of planning.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user describes taking the action of driving to the mountains with the intention to end things, indicating preparation.
   - Since there is evidence of a plan involving a location, this fits the criteria for 'behavior,' but if it were uncertain, I would choose 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a recent or current event (just finished driving) and expresses intentions that were not followed through, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a plan (driving to a suitable location like the mountains), which meets the 'behavior' category's requirements. It goes beyond mere ideation by describing preparation, so 'behavior' is the best fit. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'attempt' as no past action occurred, and not just 'ideation' due to the presence of a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and dying (""I'm ready to die,"" ""I'm ready to go out the way I want,"" ""I'm strapped in and ready to go""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and dissatisfaction (""nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life,"" ""Fuck this world""). There are references to preparations (""Preps being made,"" ""The date was set a while ago,"" ""I even changed it""), which suggest planning. No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are detailed, and no references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No (the word ""suicide"" isn't used, but ""I'm ready to die"" directly expresses a desire to die).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I'm ready to die,"" ""I'm ready,"" ""Fuck this world"").
   - This is not unclear, as the expressions are direct indicators of suicidal desires.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No (no explicit tools, locations, or substances are named).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., ""The date was set a while ago,"" ""I even changed it,"" ""Preps being made,"" ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" imply preparations are underway).
   - Since preparations are indicated, this goes beyond mere thoughts, but as the methods aren't specified, I'm considering the rule to choose 'ideation' if uncertain. However, the mention of ""preps"" aligns with explicit planning, so it fits 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm ready,"" ""Preps being made""), with a reference to a past action (""The date was set a while ago"" and ""I even changed it""), but it's focused on ongoing readiness rather than past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of wanting to die, which rules out 'indicator'. It includes signs of preparation (e.g., setting and changing a date, making preps), which indicates explicit planning, making it 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'. There's no description of a past attempt, so 'attempt' doesn't apply. Based on the definitions, the presence of preparations elevates this to 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user's statement ""I'm thinking of ending my life,"" which directly expresses a desire to die. Other elements involve emotional indicators such as hopelessness and despair, including mentions of past struggles like developing OCD in 2017, dropping grades, repeating a year, getting kicked out of school, depression, panic attacks, hating their current course, and losing friends. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I'm thinking of ending my life,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as stated above.
   - This is clear and not vague, so it indicates suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is mentioned.
   - Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current thoughts (""I'm thinking of ending my life"") and past events (e.g., OCD in 2017, school issues), but it focuses on present feelings rather than past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the 'Ideation' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

This indicates a desire for death or not being alive. Emotional indicators show despair or hopelessness. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up,"" which express a desire not to wake up or continue living. Since this is a direct expression of wanting to die, it qualifies as more than vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., hoping this is the last post and never waking up), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not be alive) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not Indicator, and lacks planning, so it's not Behavior or Attempt.

   - Since specific methods and preparations are clearly indicated, this leans toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., previous posts about intentions) but primarily focuses on current and future intentions (e.g., ""this time i actually have the means to"" and ""tonight im gonna do it"").
   - No past attempts are specifically described, only past unfulfilled intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and includes specific plans (e.g., methods and timeline), which aligns with 'behavior'. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of means and preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme exhaustion and despair, such as ""running on nothing but shear spite"" and ""even spite has its limits."" There are mentions of wanting to ""check out,"" which is a euphemism for dying or suicide, and an explicit mention of ""suicide"" itself. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and a lack of moral objection to suicide. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used directly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I really want to check out"" and indicating no moral problem with suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps taken toward acting on these thoughts. Since there is no explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die and no moral objection to suicide, but lacks any specific plan or method.

There are indications of hopelessness and despair, but no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""im going to do it"" and ""im done"" imply a desire to end one's life, though it's not crystal clear. Since it's somewhat explicit in implying a desire, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of ""kill myself,"" which relates to suicide. There are emotional indicators such as stress, a desire for an easier way out, and hopelessness about the future (""I've never really seen myself going anywhere in life so. why not""). No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user expresses that it would be easier and questions why not.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post asks for a ""mostly painless way"" but does not specify any tools, locations, or substances. There are no signs of preparation. Since no explicit plan is detailed, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (e.g., seeking a way to kill oneself), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die and hopelessness, but lacks any specific plan or method.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include discussions of suicide, specifically overdosing on pills as a method. It mentions death, dying, and the process of suicide in detail, including physical effects like vomiting, liver damage, and regret. Emotional indicators include concern and deterrence, but these are directed at someone else, not the poster. There are no references to the poster's own plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post directly references ""commit suicide"" and describes overdosing as a way to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, these expressions are not from the poster; they are warnings directed at another person. The post focuses on advising others, not the poster's own thoughts. Since the risk must pertain to the person writing the post, and no personal suicidal desires are indicated, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, overdosing on pills is detailed, including effects and timelines.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, as this is not about the poster's own actions or preparations; it's descriptive advice. Even though methods are mentioned, they are not linked to the poster's behavior, so I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, but here it's not the poster's plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to hypothetical or general future events for the person being addressed, not the poster's past, current, or future intentions. No past attempts are described for the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post mentions suicide explicitly but only in the context of advising others, not expressing the poster's own thoughts, plans, or feelings. There are no indicators of the poster's personal suicidal risk, so it fits 'indicator' as defined, where explicit personal expression is absent. If in doubt, I choose 'indicator' over other categories.

No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the phrase ""do it"" is implied but not directly stated. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""no motivation to keep on living"" and ""ill do it when im fed up."" Since there are direct expressions of not wanting to live, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no explicit plan, this should be classified as ideation rather than behavior.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of anger and resentment towards the user's parents for having them, describing their life as ""psychologically tortured"" due to neglect and lack of care. There are emotional indicators of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on general life dissatisfaction and parental blame, with no explicit references to suicide or desires to end one's life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plans or methods related to suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past and current feelings about the user's life and parents' actions, but it does not describe any past attempts or current/future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, plans, or past attempts.

The user mentions waking up with a severe panic attack, feeling terrified, and experiencing anxiety about sleeping. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the user.

No. The post focuses on a disturbing dream and its emotional aftermath, with no indication of suicidal thoughts. Since there's no explicit mention, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? The post describes methods in the context of the dream (e.g., slicing people), but these are not related to the user's own actions or suicide. There are no signs of preparation for self-harm or suicide. As there's no uncertainty about planning for suicide, this doesn't elevate to 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a recent dream (past event) and current anxiety, but there's no reference to past suicide attempts or future intentions related to self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and anxiety from a nightmare but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, plans, or past attempts. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it involves emotional indicators without suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is preferred.

181,what comes after. i just need something to believe in so i can do it. i don't want to believe theres nothing. ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose. all i saw was fear and despair. please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to past overdoses (one accidental, one on purpose), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""fear and despair,"" ""end this suffering""), and a plea for strength and belief. There are mentions of self-harm through overdose, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations for future actions. No references to acquiring means or current intentions beyond emotional distress.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but a purposeful overdose is described, which implies suicidal behavior. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, phrases like ""end this suffering"" suggest a desire to not be alive, though it's not entirely explicit. Since it's somewhat unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' for this part, but this must be weighed with other factors.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, overdose is mentioned, but only as a past event, not as a current or future plan. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates current preparations. If uncertain about explicit planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clearly past-focused.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers primarily to past events (the two overdoses) and current emotional state (despair and need for belief), but not to future intentions. The purposeful overdose is described as a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a past suicide attempt (purposeful overdose), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. There are no current plans mentioned, so it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior'. While there are expressions of distress, the explicit reference to a past attempt overrides potential classification as 'Ideation' or 'Indicator'.

182,I thought I was getting better. for the past few weeks I've been happy just to be spending time with my partner without any bad days. I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again. I've run out of meds and I asked for an urgent refill a few days ago but my doctors/pharmacy never got back to me. I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's recent improvement in mood, sudden return of suicidal feelings, running out of medication and attempting to get a refill without success, emotional distress from impacting their partner, and fear of adding more stress. There are mentions of suicide (""I'm suicidal again""), emotional indicators like hopelessness and low mood, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""I'm suicidal again."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the phrase indicates current suicidal feelings. This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No, only a mention of running out of meds and seeking a refill, which doesn't constitute preparation for suicide. Since no plan is evident, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions (""I'm suicidal again""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no descriptions of past actions.

It's just too hard.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of anxiety, depression, feelings of worthlessness, doubt, and emotional pain. There are mentions of death and dying, such as ""I want to die more than ever"" and ""I can't have this life it's too painful."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and failure, as seen in phrases like ""Everytime I try I fail"" and ""It's just too hard."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no clear references to past suicide attempts; ""Everytime I try I fail"" seems to refer to general life efforts rather than suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I want to die more than ever."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plan or method is indicated, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and ongoing feelings and intentions, such as ""now I want to die more than ever,"" rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), but there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of ""suicide by hanging,"" which explicitly refers to suicide and a method (hanging). The user states ""ive alr tied the noose,"" indicating preparation of a tool for suicide. Emotional indicators show uncertainty (""im still not sure"") but no strong expressions of hopelessness. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Indirectly, through the context of inquiring about the method, but it's explicit enough to go beyond vague mentions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (hanging and tying the noose). Signs of preparation are present (the user has already tied the noose). This clearly indicates a plan, so it fits beyond just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current preparations and possible future intentions, not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicide mentions and evidence of preparation (tying the noose), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category as it involves suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan or method. It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Ideation' due to the plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of wanting to kill oneself and die, such as ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die because of them."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, as the user expresses distress over their sexual feelings. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of a plan or method, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I want to die""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as it involves suicidal feelings without planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of intense hatred towards the user's dad and family, references to past trauma (e.g., sexual assault by the grandfather), and general dissatisfaction with life. There are emotional indicators of anger, frustration, and hopelessness, such as ""i hate everything i just wanna end it."" 
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" suggests a possible desire to end their life, but it is vague and not clearly tied to suicide or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of hate, resentment, and a sense of injustice, indicating distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned; there are no references to tools, locations, or steps for self-harm.
   - References to past attempts: The post mentions past trauma (assault), but not any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the phrase ""i just wanna end it"" is ambiguous and could refer to ending the situation or life in general, but it does not directly state suicide or a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, it's not explicit; it expresses general dissatisfaction but lacks clear suicidal language.
   - Since this is unclear, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to any methods, tools, or preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but since no plan exists, it doesn't qualify for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., the assault) and current feelings of hatred and wanting to ""end it,"" but there are no indications of future intentions or past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general distress and vague expressions of wanting to end something, which fits 'indicator' due to the lack of explicit suicide mentions. Even with hopelessness, the instructions emphasize that vague feelings without explicit suicide references should be classified as 'indicator.' Therefore, based on the analysis and the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt, this is the best fit.

187,"Consider going hobo. Hi people. I just want to point out the alternative for anyone on the brink of suicide. There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant. Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses the idea of going ""hobo"" or living as a vagrant as an alternative to suicide, aimed at others who might be struggling. It mentions the author's past experiences of feeling unable to cope and choosing vagrancy instead. Emotional indicators include expressions of dissatisfaction with life, such as not wanting to deal with a ""shitty day job"" or problems, suggesting hopelessness. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, self-harm, or preparations for suicide. References to past events involve the author going vagrant, not suicide attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in the context of suggesting an alternative ""for anyone on the brink of suicide,"" but this is not a direct expression from the author about their own current thoughts or feelings. It is more advisory and refers to others.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the author describes vagrancy as a positive escape and comfort, without expressing a personal desire to end their life.
   - Since the mention is not explicit for the author and is unclear as personal ideation, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for suicide are mentioned; only details about vagrancy (e.g., living in squats, begging). There are no signs of preparation for suicide, such as tools, locations, or notes.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, there's no evidence of any suicidal planning at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to past events (the author's previous experiences with vagrancy) and a general future option for escape, but not as a current or future suicide intention. No past suicide attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction and hopelessness but does not explicitly mention suicide for the author themselves. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because there are no direct suicidal thoughts, desires, or plans expressed. Even though suicide is referenced vaguely for others, the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions for the author.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""My life has been getting worse,"" ""I'm so lonely I can't go on anymore,"" ""I fucked up my life,"" and ""I miss being happy."" There are mentions of death or dying through the phrase ""end it,"" which implies suicide. Emotional indicators show deep distress, addiction, loneliness, and current intoxication (""now I'm drunk in my basement""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, nor references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it"" is a direct expression of wanting to die, especially in the context of the post. This leans toward an explicit indication, as it conveys a desire to not be alive anymore.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances beyond being drunk, or locations) are mentioned. The phrase ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" suggests an intention but lacks details on how it will be carried out. Since there's no explicit plan or preparation, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""tonight""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""end it""), indicating a desire to die, but there is no specific plan or method mentioned. This fits the definition of 'ideation' rather than 'indicator' (which requires no explicit suicide mentions) or 'behavior' (which needs a specific plan). When in doubt, the rules prioritize 'ideation' over 'behavior' if planning is unclear.

189,"I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen. Will I be able to successfully end my life? I'm fairly short, male and 56 kg.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of having 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen, which are substances that could be used for self-harm. The user is asking if these will allow them to successfully end their life and provides personal details (short, male, 56 kg). There are direct mentions of death and suicide through the phrase ""end my life."" Emotional indicators include implied desperation, as they're inquiring about the effectiveness of these means. Specific plans or methods: Codeine and ibuprofen are specified as potential methods for overdose. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user directly asks if they can ""end my life.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the question implies a desire to die.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user specifies 800mg codeine and ibuprofen, which are substances that could be used for overdose.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user states they have access to these items, indicating possession and potential preparation.
   - Since specific methods (means) are mentioned, this aligns with planning, making it more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current possessions and future intentions (inquiring if it will work), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific methods (codeine and ibuprofen as means), which fits the definition of 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It's not just ideation because methods are detailed, and it's not an attempt since no past action is described. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of profound despair, failure, and a desire to end life, such as ""why shouldi live,"" ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""i cant do this anymore,"" and ""i cant stand being here any other moment."" There are mentions of death or dying implied through phrases like ""resisting the desire to end"" and ""reasons tokeep myself alive,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, lifelong suffering, and lack of enjoyment in life. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""why shouldi live,"" and ""i cant live like this for the rest of my life."" However, since the mentioning is not very explicit (e.g., no direct statement like ""I want to kill myself""), I must lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, per the rules.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but since nothing indicates a plan, this doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to ongoing and future intentions, such as daily suffering and not imagining living another year, rather than past events. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and a vague desire to end life, but without explicit mentions of suicide or a plan. According to the definitions, very large general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicide mentions should be classified as 'indicator.' Even though there are implied desires to not be alive, the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions. Therefore, this fits best as 'indicator.'

There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and inevitability, as the user expresses concern about informing loved ones of their potential action. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""commit suicide"" is used directly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user states they will ""probably commit suicide eventually,"" indicating a desire for self-ending. Since this is clear and explicit, it does not lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since there is no evidence of explicit planning, this aligns with choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions, as indicated by ""eventually,"" suggesting a potential future action rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to commit suicide eventually) but lacks any specific plan or method, which fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'Attempt' as it does not describe past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of overwhelming distress, such as financial mistakes from the past haunting the writer, hiding problems from family, hearing voices, constant crying, and a desire to see his daughters grow up. There are mentions of death and suicide through the phrase ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself,"" which implies suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of not coping. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""end myself"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the voices urging self-ending. This is explicit enough to go beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no plan is detailed, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (financial mistakes years ago) and current feelings (hearing voices, crying, not coping), with some future-oriented thoughts (wanting to see daughters grow up). There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts; it's focused on present distress.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""end myself""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as there are no elements of planning or past attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hope after leaving an abusive relationship, desires for emotional support regarding mental health, and a vague reference to not needing to die. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm beyond the phrase ""maybe I don't need to die,"" which is indirect. Emotional indicators include past distress from abuse and current hopes for support, suggesting some hopelessness but framed positively. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" is vague and implies a rejection of the idea rather than a desire. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so no need to consider 'behavior'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and a vague feeling about dying, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there is no explicit expression concerning suicide, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and dying, such as ""i dont wanna die rn"" and ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" There are emotional indicators like boredom leading to suicidal thoughts, expressing distress and a desire for calm. Specific plans or methods are referenced, including taking 3 Xanax pills as a potential means of harm. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""suicidal thoughts are always there."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the acknowledgment of suicidal thoughts and the query about dying from pills, though they say they don't want to die right now.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as taking 3 Xanax pills, which is a substance that could be lethal. There are signs of preparation or intent, as the user states ""i will do it anyway,"" indicating a plan to act. Since a specific method is described, this leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is discussing an action they plan to take now (""i will do it anyway""), rather than past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (taking 3 Xanax pills) with intent to act, which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the explicit plan, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as self-loathing phrases like ""shitface,"" ""fucking monster,"" and ""piece of human garbage."" There are explicit mentions of self-harm, specifically asking ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing."" Additionally, there is a direct mention of suicide in the phrase ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are detailed, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned in the phrase ""i will wait until I can kill myself,"" which directly expresses a desire to die. Therefore, the answer is Yes for both questions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not mentioned for suicide itself, though there is an inquiry about self-harm locations, which relates to self-harm rather than a clear suicide plan. There are no signs of preparation for suicide, such as acquiring tools or writing a note. Since this is uncertain as a full plan, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings of distress and future intentions (e.g., ""i will wait until I can kill myself"" if a condition is met). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as the desire to ""kill myself,"" but lacks any specific plan or preparations for suicide. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing methods or actions. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct statement about intending to kill oneself (""Im probably going to kill myself soon""), expressions of a strong urge to do so, and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""the only people i have in my life dont care,"" ""They dont make any effort to keep me around,"" ""i just wish i wasn't even born,"" and ""life is fucking stupid""). There are no mentions of specific methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the post directly states ""Im probably going to kill myself soon."" There are also direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (Yes), such as wishing they weren't born.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned, and there are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing a note). Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""soon""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses temptation to jump from the highest floor, mentions plummeting to the ground, and discusses potential outcomes like becoming a corpse or being crippled. It also includes emotional indicators such as guilt and fear regarding the impact on others left behind. There are mentions of death and dying, implied through the act of jumping, but no explicit references to self-harm or past attempts. Specific plans include the method (jumping from a height) and location (highest floor).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) - The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the description implies it through the action of jumping.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) - The user expresses temptation to end their life via plummeting, indicating a desire for death.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is clear enough as an expression of wanting to die, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? (Yes) - The post specifies jumping from the highest floor as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) - No explicit preparations like writing a note or acquiring tools are mentioned.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is a specific method described, so this qualifies as planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? (Current/future) - The post describes current temptation and potential future action, with no reference to past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? (No)

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (temptation to die) and mentions a specific method (jumping from the highest floor), which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning.

There are emotional indicators suggesting distress or guilt related to hurting a boyfriend, implying a sense of desperation or manipulation, but no explicit hopelessness or despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as it expresses an idea of ending one's life. Since it is explicit, I do not lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about how the suicide would be carried out. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (desire to kill oneself) but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

199,"How does no one notice when I'm standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage?. I can never get the nerve to jump. But I'll stand there. Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve. No one has ever stopped. The last time, someone came out of the elevator looked at me and kept walking, got into their car and left. Do hospitals even have security? This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include the user describing standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage, trying to work up the nerve to jump, and expressing repeated visits to this location. There are mentions of death and dying implied through references to jumping and someone else's past suicide at the same spot. Emotional indicators include despair, loneliness, and a hope for intervention, such as ""hoping someone will stop me and show they care."" No specific tools or substances are mentioned, but the location (ledge of a parking garage) is highlighted as a method. There are no direct references to past attempts by the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but phrases like ""trying to work up the nerve to jump"" and ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"" imply a desire to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through indirect expressions of wanting to jump and die.
   - Since it's not entirely explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the context strongly suggests suicidal intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, jumping from the ledge of a hospital parking garage is described as a potential method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions repeatedly going to the location, standing or sitting there for up to an hour, and trying to build courage, which indicates ongoing engagement with the idea.
   - If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here the specific location and repeated actions qualify as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing intentions, as the user describes present actions like standing on the ledge and hoping for intervention. There is a reference to a past event (someone else's suicide 6 years ago), but no description of the user's own past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress ('indicator') due to implied desires to die and specific method descriptions. It includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts with a plan (location and repeated visits), fitting 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'. There are no past attempts described, so 'attempt' doesn't apply.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user's long-term struggle with depression since 2nd grade, loss of parents, experiences of abuse, current life difficulties (e.g., poor grades, job risk, arrest), feelings of hopelessness, and explicit references to suicide attempts and searching for methods. There are mentions of death, dying, and suicide, emotional indicators like despair and exhaustion, specific past methods (e.g., using a phone charger), and references to multiple past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user describes past suicide attempts and expresses thoughts of death as an answer.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user states that death seems like the ultimate answer and mentions searching for ways to kill themselves.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user references a past method (phone charger) and recent searching for ways to make death look like an accident.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is indication of recent searching, which could suggest preparation, but it's not fully explicit as ongoing actions. Following the rules, if uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this ties into past attempts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., previous suicide attempts, parental deaths) and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing struggles, recent searching for methods). Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (e.g., using a phone charger), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. It also mentions current suicidal thoughts and searching for methods, but the presence of described past attempts takes precedence. According to the definitions, content describing past attempts qualifies as 'Attempt', and if it includes both past attempts and current plans, it remains 'Attempt'. Therefore, this fits best as 'Attempt'.

Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of emotional distress, such as feeling uncared for, betrayed, and emotionally numb (""more dead inside""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""nobody cares about me,"" ""done being played with,"" and ""done with everything."" There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although ""more dead inside"" and ""done with everything"" suggest emotional exhaustion, these are metaphorical and not direct expressions of suicidal intent. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current feelings of frustration and hopelessness, with no indication of past events, past attempts, or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it involves vague emotional dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include references to jumping off, specifically from a bedroom window, with details about trees and mud below making it less scary. This implies a method of self-harm or suicide. Emotional indicators include gaining courage and hope to do it soon, suggesting determination and possible despair. There are no mentions of death or suicide explicitly by name, but the act described is suicidal. Specific plans or methods are mentioned (jumping from the window), and there are signs of mental preparation (gaining courage). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the desire is implied through the intent to jump, which is a method that could end life.
   - Since it's not entirely explicit but leans toward suicidal intent, I must consider the rules: if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. However, the context strongly suggests suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, jumping from the bedroom window is specified, with details about the environment (trees and mud) that make it feasible or less intimidating.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, phrases like ""getting more courage"" and ""hopefully I can do it soon"" indicate mental preparation and future intent.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, the specific method is clear, so it goes beyond just thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I think I can jump off"" and ""hopefully I can do it soon""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post does not fit 'Indicator' because it goes beyond general distress; it implies suicidal intent through a described method.
   - It fits 'Behavior' as there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts combined with a specific plan (jumping from the window), meeting the definition of including a method or preparation.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because a specific plan is mentioned, and not 'Attempt' since no past action is described.

There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user's hesitation to share mental health issues with their mom, family history of mental illness, feelings of pressure to be perfect, dislike for therapy, and expressions of depression. Specifically, there is a mention of ""writing suicide notes"" when depression hits hard.

There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations beyond writing notes, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to ""writing suicide notes,"" which implies suicidal thoughts. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, but the mention of writing suicide notes suggests thoughts related to suicide. Since this is somewhat explicit, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plans. Writing suicide notes might indicate preparation, but it's not explicit or detailed enough to qualify as a plan. Therefore, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' due to uncertainty.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and ongoing issues with depression, including instances of writing suicide notes, but it does not describe past attempts or future intentions explicitly. It's focused on present emotional state rather than historical events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., writing suicide notes) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""hope i die,"" which directly expresses a desire to die.
   - Since there is a direct expression, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as per the instructions to choose ideation if there's any indication.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is mentioned, it should be classified as ideation rather than behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die (""hope i die""), which qualifies as suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'ideation.'

Key elements include the word ""cut,"" which is often associated with self-injury, and emotional indicators like ""Ah"" and ""fuck,"" suggesting frustration or distress. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The content is vague and does not clearly indicate suicidal thoughts, so I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? The word ""cut"" could imply a method like self-cutting, but it is not detailed or explicit (e.g., no tools or locations specified). There are no signs of preparation. Since it is uncertain whether this constitutes explicit planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but overall, it does not meet the threshold for either.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This seems to refer to a current event rather than past or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses distress and possibly self-harm but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or specific plans.

Writing this while my head is at it's clearest.

I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

209,"they took the last bit of stability i have. i just got laid off from my well paying, work from home, low stress, work at your own pace, non-entry level job on wednesday. they took the last bit of stability i have in my life. i live alone because my ex was an abusive pos who i escaped so i have no partner to help keep me afloat till i find something new. i can't rely on my mom because she just lost her job too and im too prideful to tell my dad i don't have a job anymore. i'm also in school which i may have to withdraw from. i lost everything that made me feel comfortable in life in a 5 minute zoom call. i can't ever find a job that pays as much because my role was very specific to the company and is not widely available elsewhere. it's also not something i can use as a marketable skill elsewhere. my life has always been shit but being able to finally support myself was the only thing that made me feel okay about being me. but i guess my ex was right about me, i'm an ugly useless stupid girl who is better off dead. and now its gone. and likely won't come back for years and years and years, if ever. i'm so tired of having everything decent or good in my life taken from me. theres no fucking reason to keep playing this bullshit game. its just struggle and work and work and work and then when you finally get something positive out of life it's ripped away from you. i'm just an ugly 27 year old woman with no degree, no partner, no job, no reason to keep going. ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears. now i really don't care any more. my parents are the reason i have to suffer, why should i care about them? they didnt care about my future to invest in it when they had the means to, why should i care about their emotional state?. i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself. then i can rest in peace.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, despair, and loss (e.g., job loss, isolation, abusive past). There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""better off dead,"" ""no reason to keep going,"" and a specific plan to end her life. Emotional indicators include feelings of worthlessness, exhaustion, and resentment toward her parents. Specific plans are mentioned, including driving to the mountains, hiking to a remote spot, and hanging herself. There are references to past thoughts of suicide but no explicit past attempts described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""better off dead,"" ""no reason to keep going,"" and detailed thoughts of ending her life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as hanging herself, along with locations (mountains) and steps (driving and hiking to a remote spot), which indicate preparation. This goes beyond vague thoughts, as it includes a clear plan, so it fits the criteria for 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., abusive ex, childhood fears), but the suicidal expressions and plan are focused on current feelings and future intentions. No concrete past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (method, location, and steps), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It exceeds 'ideation' due to the presence of planning and is not 'attempt' since no past action is detailed. It's not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and planned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""I don't enjoy anything,"" ""I am lonely,"" ""I am not healing,"" ""It is terrible""), and mentions of seeking help (""I am seeking therapy and taking antidepressants""). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., the word ""suicide"" isn't used), but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore""). This qualifies as explicit suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: There are no specific methods mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances), and no signs of preparation. Therefore, it does not indicate planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions, with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, which fits the definition of Ideation, as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) but lacks the elements required for Behavior or Attempt.

211,"its supposed to get better but i want to know when. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm doing everything people say they do to get better but it's just not working. I take care of my body: I workout 5-7 times a week, I sleep 8-10 hrs a night, I eat nutritious meals. I'm part of a prestigious grad program for my field, one that I should be proud of and is undeniably an accomplishment. I volunteer regularly with womens groups and lgbtq groups. I'm on medication and I see a therapist weekly. When I'm sad, I journal, I use DBT skills, I try to fight cognitive distortions. But I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal. People say to wait it out, but its been years. Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts. Its supposed to get better but I just want to know when. I read so many articles and videos and posts about people that have recovered from being suicidal and I just don't get why I'm plagued with this. I'm doing all the same things. Its so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on when I dont even know what else to try at this point. I'm just tired of all of it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of ongoing distress, frustration with mental health efforts, and explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts. The user describes engaging in positive behaviors like exercising, sleeping well, eating nutritious meals, being in a grad program, volunteering, taking medication, and seeing a therapist, but still feels hopeless and exhausted. There are direct mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and being ""unbelievably suicidal."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, lack of motivation, and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the explicit use of ""suicidal"" and descriptions of ongoing suicidal thoughts, indicating a desire to not continue living.
   - This is clear, so it goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about notes, acquiring means, or planning.
   - Since there's no indication of a plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings (""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"" and ""it's been years""), not past events or future intentions with specifics. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (e.g., ""unbelievably suicidal""), which fits 'ideation' as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide references, not 'behavior' due to the absence of any plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are detailed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of needing therapy, dealing with depression and anxiety, feeling ""fucked up,"" lacking motivation to get up, and fear of telling parents due to potential judgment. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as seen in the lack of motivation and general dissatisfaction with life. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. Since there are no explicit mentions, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of planning, this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and intentions, such as the need for therapy now, but does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, depression, anxiety, and hopelessness, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over other categories.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly and references a specific method inspired by a video (using eye drops for suicide). Emotional indicators include trying to suppress thoughts, expressing regret (""i wish i wasn't like this""), and a sigh, indicating distress and hopelessness. There are no mentions of self-harm, preparations, or past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""a new suicide method.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the acknowledgment of suicidal thoughts and the idea derived from the video.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies eye drops as a potential suicide method based on a video.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of acquiring means or taking steps toward action.
   - Since a specific method (eye drops) is mentioned, this aligns with the rule to consider it 'behavior' if specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current thoughts and ideas, not past events. There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (eye drops), which per the definitions qualifies as 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.' There is no evidence of actual preparation or past attempts, so 'attempt' doesn't apply. It's not vague enough to be 'indicator.'

Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses self-realization of being the cause of problems, writing a suicide note a month ago, planning a suicide (including time and place), sabotaging the plan, feeling calm about it, and now wanting to recapture that feeling to possibly follow through. 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, explicitly mentions suicide through the note, planning, and potential future action.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, frustration, self-blame, and a desire for the calm feeling associated with suicidal planning.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, mentions writing a suicide note, picking a specific time and place, and having it ""primed and ready.""
   - References to past attempts: Refers to past planning and preparation but not a completed attempt, as they sabotaged it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through references to the suicide note and planning.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied in the planning and the desire to feel calm again to potentially act.
   - The mentions are clear, so this is not just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, includes preparations like writing a note, selecting a time and place.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the note was written and ready to be posted, with a chosen time and place.
   - This indicates explicit planning, so it aligns with 'behavior' rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (writing the note and planning a month ago) but also expresses current feelings and potential future action (""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No concrete attempt occurred; it was planning that was sabotaged.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts, preparations (note, time, place), and hints at current intentions, which fits 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the described preparations, and no concrete past attempt is confirmed, so 'attempt' does not apply.

I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay.

As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of severe emotional distress, such as feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, worthlessness, and suffering from an abusive background, PTSD, and anxiety. There are mentions of wishing not to be alone and feeling like a ""stain upon the world,"" as well as a vague sense that the world wouldn't change if the person were gone. However, there are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted. There are references to past abuse but not to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there is a vague implication in phrases like ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone,"" which suggests worthlessness but does not explicitly indicate suicidal thoughts. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's nothing to suggest even ideation explicitly.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current feelings and past abuse (e.g., being beaten by a father), but there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts or current/future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'. There are no elements of 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt' present.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts,"" desires for death (e.g., ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please""), and references to death as appealing. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and questioning the purpose of life, but also positive aspects like friends and family. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" and ""suicide would be better.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""it would be better if I was dead"" and enthusiasm for ""eternal sleep.""
   - The mentions are clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" in the present), with no reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and desires to die but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's search for a hotline that won't track them or involve the police, a description of a past experience where calling a hotline led to police intervention and a 3-day stay in a psych ward, and the statement that this experience made them ""10x more suicidal."" There are mentions of suicide through the phrase ""more suicidal,"" indicating emotional distress, worry, and paranoia. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, and there are no references to past suicide attempts, only to a past intervention.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user states it made them ""10x more suicidal."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the explicit mention of increased suicidal feelings, which implies a desire related to not wanting to live, though not in the present tense.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no indications of any plan or method, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers primarily to a past event (the psych ward stay) that resulted in increased suicidal feelings, which could imply current distress. However, it does not describe past attempts or current/future intentions with specifics.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""made me 10x more suicidal""), indicating a desire related to not wanting to live, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of ""Ideation."" It is not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not ""Behavior"" due to the absence of any plan, and not ""Attempt"" as no past suicide attempt is described.

There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and a desire for isolation (""I just want be by myself""). No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the phrase ""I dont want to live anymore,"" which expresses a desire not to be alive. Since this is a direct expression, it qualifies as more than just vague distress, but I'll lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, this seems explicit enough for consideration in ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plan or method is indicated, if it were borderline, I'd choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions, as it's in the present tense (e.g., ""I dont want to live anymore""). No reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (desire not to live) without any specific plan, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction, so it's not 'Indicator'. There's no plan or past attempt, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of anger and frustration about being accused of attention-seeking when dealing with suicidal thoughts. There are mentions of ""suicidal"" in a quoted context (e.g., ""if you are actually suicidal""), but not directly from the user. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT,"" ""I STILL NEED HELP,"" and ""They won't believe it until I die,"" which suggest distress and a fear of not being believed. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the user does not explicitly state their own suicidal thoughts; the term ""suicidal"" is used in a quote from someone else.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, while there is an indirect reference in ""They won't believe it until I die,"" it is not a direct expression of the user's desire. Given the instruction to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, this supports 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this in the post. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but since no plan is present, it doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings of frustration and past experiences of being ignored when asking for help, but it does not describe past suicide attempts or explicit future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of the user's suicidal thoughts or desires. There are no direct expressions of wanting to die, no plans, and no references to past attempts. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator' as it involves vague feelings of distress without explicit suicide mentions. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

Im sad to say this might be my final good bye. ill miss my family they've always taken care of me but there's only so much to be done.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of loneliness, tiredness, hopelessness, and explicit mentions of suicide such as ""i feel like killing my self every day"" and ""suicide note."" Emotional indicators show despair and a sense of giving up. There are signs of preparation like ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament,"" but no specific methods (e.g., tools or locations) or references to past attempts are detailed.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""i feel like killing my self every day"" and ""suicide note.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""i feel like killing my self every day"" and ""this might be my final good bye.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are specified.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post mentions ""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done,"" indicating preparations have been made.
   - Since there are clear signs of preparation, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to current and future intentions, such as ongoing feelings and preparations, with phrases like ""i feel like killing my self every day"" and ""this might be my final good bye."" There are no explicit descriptions of past attempts, only references to past efforts in life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions preparations (suicide note, etc.), which meets the criteria for 'behavior.' It goes beyond mere ideation due to the preparations, and there's no description of a past attempt, so 'attempt' doesn't apply. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting. I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog. I haven't talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks i'm ok. I'm not though. I don't know what to do anymore. I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of suicide (e.g., ""kms"" which means kill myself, repeated multiple times), self-harm (e.g., ""I can't stop cutting""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I'm holding it all in and I'm about to explode,"" ""I'm not ok,"" ""I can't get these thoughts out of my head""). There are expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"") but no specific methods, plans, or preparations are detailed. No references to past suicide attempts are present, though ongoing self-harm is implied.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kms,"" ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I'm about to kms,"" ""I finally accepted the fact that I'm going to kill myself very soon"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No – No tools, locations, substances, or detailed plans are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No – No indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - Since there are no specific ideas of how to commit suicide, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself very soon,"" ""I'm about to kms, just not yet""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die (e.g., ""kms,"" ""kill myself""), which rules out 'indicator'. However, there are no specific plans or methods mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'. It fits 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan. If in doubt, the rules emphasize choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' when no explicit plan is present.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of wanting to kill oneself, a suicide note that was written and discarded, desires to harm oneself to affect others, emotional indicators of anger, resentment, and hopelessness, and references to family interventions and arguments.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, with phrases like ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself,"" ""shoot myself,"" and ""suicide notes.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through expressions of not caring about family consequences and wishing to burden them with one's death.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, ""shoot myself"" indicates a specific method (using a gun), and the mention of a suicide note suggests preparation.
   - References to past attempts: There is a reference to a suicide note that was thrown away and found, but this does not describe a concrete past attempt, only preparation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""suicide notes"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself,"" ""I wish I could shoot myself on the spot"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""shoot myself"" refers to a gun as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the suicide note indicates preparation, even if it was discarded.
   - Since a specific method and preparation are mentioned, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., writing and discarding the suicide note, family intervention) and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing desires to kill oneself and make family suffer).
   - Past attempts are not specifically described as concrete actions; it's more about past preparations.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts along with specific methods (shooting) and preparations (suicide note), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It exceeds 'Ideation' due to the presence of planning elements and is not 'Attempt' since no concrete past action is detailed. It is not 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned.

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions overdose (OD) as a method of self-harm, specifically planning to take all prescribed medications at once (venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh, and inderal). It includes emotional indicators like hopelessness (""I can't feel anything right now and it's all I can think about"") and explicit references to suicide (""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now""). There are no mentions of past attempts, only ongoing thoughts and current intentions.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, suicide is directly mentioned, along with a desire to OD and hope for it to be lethal.
   - Emotional indicators: Despair and numbness are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Specific medications are listed, and the user mentions intending to take them all at once today.
   - References to past attempts: None; it's about current and past thoughts, not actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I feel like popping all of them at once and hope for the best"" indicate a desire for a potentially fatal outcome.
   - The content is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user details overdosing on specific prescription drugs (venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh, and inderal) and plans to do so today.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user has access to a month's prescription, which implies means are available, and they express intent to act immediately.
   - This goes beyond ideation into explicit planning, so 'behavior' is appropriate rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future: ""Think I'm going to OD today"" indicates immediate plans. It also references past thoughts (""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now""), but no past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (overdosing on named medications today), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'ideation' because a plan is detailed, and not 'attempt' as no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""I've got nothing left,"" ""I'm completely used up,"" and a farewell-like tone with apologies and thanks to family and others. There are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show regret and exhaustion, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" implies a vague desire for cessation, it is not explicit. Since it is unclear and not direct, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or any form of planning, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but in this case, it doesn't even reach ideation level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and possibly future intentions in a vague sense, but not to past events or attempts. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Based on the rules, when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, it fits best under 'Indicator'. Even though there might be an implied vague feeling, the guidelines emphasize choosing 'Indicator' in doubt.

My mind is going crazy and all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat. I feel incredibly overwhelmed and don't know what to do. Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as feeling ""terrible,"" ""incredibly overwhelmed,"" and unable to cry. There are direct mentions of suicide and self-harm: the user states ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" and ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, with phrases like ""My mind is going crazy"" and ""I don't know what to do."" A specific method of self-harm is mentioned (cutting the throat), but there are no references to preparations or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a desire to ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat,"" which implies a wish to end their life. This is clear and not vague, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies ""cutting my god damn throat"" as a method, which involves a tool (e.g., a knife). Are there signs of preparation? No, such as acquiring means or writing a note. Since a specific method is mentioned, this indicates a plan, aligning more with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions, such as ""I feel so bad"" and ""all I want to do is,"" rather than past events. There is no description of past attempts, only a mention of being ""already suicidal and depressed,"" which does not detail any concrete past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific method (cutting the throat), which constitutes a plan. This fits the 'behavior' category, as it goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a method, even without explicit preparations. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide mention, not 'ideation' due to the plan, and not 'attempt' as it describes current intentions rather than past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post: The user mentions a quote that includes the phrase ""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going cause it doesnt matter."" This references suicide indirectly through the quote. There are no personal emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair from the user. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned. The post is inquisitive, asking about the quote rather than expressing personal intent.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the quoted phrase ""kill yourself,"" but this is not the user's own expression; it's attributed to an external quote. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user is not expressing this personally; they are sharing and inquiring about the quote. Since the mention is not the user's explicit personal statement, and the rules emphasize doubting toward 'indicator,' I lean toward it not qualifying as explicit from the poster.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the quote is general and does not detail any methods, tools, locations, or preparations. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this in the post. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but there's no indication of planning here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a recent discovery (stumbling upon the quote), but it's not about the user's past, current, or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post does not contain explicit expressions of the user's own suicidal thoughts or feelings. The suicide reference is in a quote, and the user is merely discussing it without personal endorsement or indication of risk. According to the definitions, this lacks the user's direct expression, so it fits 'Indicator.' When in doubt, as per the rules, I choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation.'

Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, evident in phrases like ""i'm not happy anymore,"" ""i've never been truly happy,"" ""i give up on everything,"" and ""my life will never get better."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""i want to leave earth"" and ""wanting to die.""
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current and ongoing feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""i'm ready to join my dog""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses the user's grandfather's death and reflects on a previous decision to kill themselves before Christmas. It mentions emotional impacts on the family, a shift in perspective, and a decision not to proceed due to the potential harm to their mother. 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, the user explicitly states ""I was going to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: There are signs of past hopelessness (previous decision to end life) and current appreciation, but no ongoing despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No references to actual past attempts; it's about a past intention.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I was going to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, in the past tense, indicating a desire to die.
   - The mentions are clear, so this is not just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, substances, or locations are detailed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill themselves), but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'. It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' without a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past action occurred.

Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user's doubts about their depression, family conflicts (e.g., fights with mom, perceived unfair treatment compared to brother), emotional distress from social anxiety and seasonal depression, and recurring thoughts of suicide. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""think about suicide,"" ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" and ""want to commit suicide."" Emotional indicators include feelings of anger, hopelessness, and self-doubt (e.g., questioning if they're faking it or being dramatic). There are no explicit references to past attempts, but there is mention of researching methods as a form of potential preparation. No specific tools, locations, or substances are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""thoughts about suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""commit suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses desires related to suicide when triggered by family issues.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The user mentions ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" which implies considering methods but does not specify exact ones (e.g., no mention of tools, substances, or locations). This could suggest early planning, but it's not explicit or detailed. There are no signs of concrete preparations like acquiring means or writing a note. Since the instructions advise choosing 'ideation' if unsure about explicit planning, I lean toward that.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past thoughts (e.g., in February) and current/future intentions (e.g., thoughts triggered by ongoing family issues), but there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts—only ongoing ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and desires, fitting the criteria for Ideation, as there are expressions of wanting to die without a clearly detailed plan or method. While researching ways is mentioned, it does not constitute explicit planning (e.g., no specific means or preparations are described), so I choose Ideation over Behavior due to the rule of uncertainty.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""death"" and ""suicide"" explicitly in the phrase ""Death and suicide need to be normalized."" It also expresses general dissatisfaction with life, such as ""Life is useless"" and describes an idealized state after death (""something better on the other side... without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair about life. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used in the context of normalizing it.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, there is no direct personal statement like ""I want to die""; instead, it discusses death and suicide in a general, abstract manner. Since it's not a clear personal desire and could be unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no indication of a plan, and if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but based on the lack of explicit personal suicidal desire, it doesn't reach ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to general current feelings or opinions about life and death, not past events or future intentions. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and mentions suicide, but lacks explicit personal suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive. According to the definitions, very large general dissatisfaction and even mentions of suicide without explicit personal desire fall under 'indicator'. When in doubt, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Therefore, this best fits 'indicator'.

   - Key elements: The post mentions ""the thought of death"" and describes it as beautiful, with phrases like ""to never feel pain anymore,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""to be nothing in a black sea of infinity,"" and ""to let go after holding on so tight."" These indicate a romanticized view of death and emotional indicators of despair or hopelessness, such as a desire to escape pain. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there are vague expressions about death as an escape, it does not directly state a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's no indication of planning at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to general or current thoughts about death, not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

233,"i'm getting my covid test results tomorrow. and i'll be deciding what to do once i get them. i've been feeling like absolute shit for the past few weeks. i've had sore throat, a possible fever, and now i have cough. aside from that, i've been feeling like a fucking outcast from everyone. my dad keeps getting mad at me for the smallest things while my friends basically don't fucking care about me. i'm so fucking tired and i want to reach out but there's literally no one i can go to. i'm literally just stuck in my head and it doesn't help that i'm also sick. all my life i just wanted to feel like i belong somewhere but i never fucking knew where. all i ever wanted was for someone to care about me so that i'd have something to hold onto, something that would give me another fucking reason to live. in the end, i receive jackshit. there's so much going on in my head that i can't even begin where to start or even know how to fix. but now, it all comes down to my covid results. if i'm negative, i'll run away. i'll leave everyone behind and whatever happens to me by then happens, it wouldn't matter anymore. if i'm positive, i'll kill myself. i used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore. i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day. it doesn't fucking matter to me anymore. this is selfish and irrational, i know, but honestly i just want to make one decision for myself for once no matter how fucking selfish it is. my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions explicit desires to die, such as ""I'll kill myself"" and ""committing suicide,"" indicating thoughts of death and suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feelings of being an outcast, and a lack of will to live (e.g., ""my will to live is hanging by a thread""). There are vague references to methods with ""I'll use any method I can,"" but no specific tools, locations, or preparations are detailed. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I'll kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I don't think I can hold onto it any longer"" regarding the will to live).
   - The mentions are clear, so this is not leaning toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are detailed; it's vague (e.g., ""any method I can""). No signs of preparation like notes or acquiring means are mentioned.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, and the instructions advise choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this fits ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""If I'm positive, I'll kill myself""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die but lacks a specific plan or preparations, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of specific methods, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I cant fucking kill myself ptoperlly"" and ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, and feelings of being a burden or disappointment, as in ""kill mslef and stop being a burden and a disappoinment."" There are references to a past attempt (taking zopiclone) and a desire for future action. Specific methods are mentioned (zopiclone, a substance), and there's an implied preparation through the act of taking it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""kill mslef and stop being a burden"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (taking an entire bottle of zopiclone).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, as the post describes having taken the substance, indicating prior access and use.
   - Since this involves a described action, it goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to a past event (the zopiclone attempt) and current/future intentions (asking what to do next to kill themselves).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (taking zopiclone), which fits the 'Attempt' category. It also mentions current desires, but per the definition, when a post refers to past attempts and current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. This is not just ideation or behavior without a concrete past action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user's struggles with being short, skinny, having Asperger's (aspie), learning disabilities, and being bullied in school. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as feeling like ""navigating through Hell"" and not belonging in society. There is a mention of suicide with the phrase ""I might kill myself."" No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with ""I might kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as it expresses a potential desire to end one's life.
   - This is explicit enough to go beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Since no plan is indicated, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events (e.g., being bullied in school) but focuses on current feelings of not belonging and a possible future action (""I might kill myself""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""I might kill myself""), indicating a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, so it fits 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and suicide, such as ""Goodbye,"" ""end it tonight,"" and ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, like ""I've been struggling with depression for god knows how long.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end it tonight"" and ""Goodbye world.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements indicating intent to become ""non existent.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details taking bottles of Tylenol and Advil as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, it specifies the action will happen ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes,"" implying immediate preparation.
   - Since there is a clear plan, this fits beyond just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (method and timing), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond vague expressions, so it's not 'Indicator' or 'Ideation.' It's not about a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions wanting to kill oneself (""i want to kill myself""), which is a direct reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include physical discomfort, misery, and frustration from not remembering past events. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present; it only discusses past misery without detailing any actions.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""i want to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as indicated by the same phrase.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is mentioned.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings triggered by past events (not remembering last year's misery), but the suicidal expression seems present-tense. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts (""i want to kill myself""), indicating a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which fits the definition of 'ideation.' It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' without a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past action is described.

Now im sure that life is sending me the message that I should die. I'm not deserving of love or even fun. And life is right. I deserve to die and suffer while doing so. And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""kill myself,"" ""end myself,"" and references to a past failed attempt in October. Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, and feelings of not deserving love or fun. There are indications of a specific plan, including a timeline (""on my birthday in two weeks""), but no detailed methods or preparations like tools or substances are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I deserve to die and suffer while doing so"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed. Are there signs of preparation? There is a mention of a plan with a timeline (""I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks""), but no explicit preparations like acquiring means. Since there is uncertainty about a fully detailed plan, I would lean toward 'ideation' if not for other factors, but the rules specify to consider the overall context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (the failed attempt in October) and current/future intentions (planning to end life in two weeks).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a mentioned plan, as well as a reference to a past attempt. According to the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt'. Therefore, despite the plan not being highly detailed, the combination of past attempt and current intentions fits 'attempt' best.

Thanks to all of you that helped me survive to this moment.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a celebration of one month since the user's last suicide attempt, the absence of current suicidal thoughts, occasional thoughts about death without intent to act, a positive shift in mood due to personal realizations, and references to past depression. There are mentions of a past suicide attempt and thoughts about death, but no emotional indicators of current hopelessness or despair—it's mostly positive. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, and there are no references to self-harm beyond the past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user refers to their ""last suicide attempt."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user states that suicidal thoughts are gone and they only think about death without wanting to act on it. Since it's explicit about a past event, this leans toward acknowledgment rather than current ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any current or past planning described in detail, so this does not elevate to 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to past events (the suicide attempt one month ago and two years of depression), with current reflections on improvement and no mention of future intentions. The past attempt is specifically described as having occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on a historic action that happened. There are no current suicidal thoughts or plans mentioned, so it doesn't fit 'Ideation' or 'Behavior.' It's not just vague distress, so 'Indicator' is not appropriate.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress such as frustration, tears, inability to sleep, guilt, tiredness, and being scared of ""awful thoughts."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post refers to ""awful thoughts"" vaguely, but does not explicitly state a desire to die. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself,"" so there is no indication of planning. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clear there's no plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and ongoing struggles (e.g., ""I've been drowning in these awful thoughts""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as there are no explicit expressions concerning suicide, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool.

My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and dying, such as ""I want to die or reverse time"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, and anger, like ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I fucking hate myself,"" and descriptions of constant worry and self-loathing. It also references self-harm ideation, such as imagining ""amputating parts of my body and burning myself."" However, there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no clear references to past suicide attempts, though it notes hospitalization for depression in high school, which is not explicitly tied to suicide.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I'm so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive"" and ""I want to die or reverse time.""
   - The mentions are explicit enough to indicate suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plans; the self-harm thoughts are described as imaginary and not as actual preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of preparations like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ongoing desires to die), with a mention of past hospitalization for depression, but it does not describe a specific past suicide attempt or action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'ideation.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'attempt' as no past suicide action is detailed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of emotional pain turning physical, depression, exhaustion, and a specific statement: ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight."" There are mentions of death through the hope of dying, indicating despair and hopelessness. No references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" directly expresses a desire to die.
   - Since this is a direct expression of wanting to die, it goes beyond vague distress, so I lean toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of any planning or actions taken.
   - Since no plan is mentioned, this fits 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and a future intention (hoping to die tonight), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) without any specific plan, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because of the direct desire to die, not just general distress. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a description of taking an overdose of Zoloft (6 pills, equivalent to 300mg), the intent to kill oneself as indicated by ""it obviously wasn't enough to kill me,"" physical symptoms like nausea and sweating, and a question about safety without hospital intervention. There are mentions of self-harm through overdose, which is a method related to suicide, and an implicit reference to death or dying. Emotional indicators are minimal, but the focus is on the action taken rather than just distress.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of the overdose and the statement about it not being enough to kill. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, inferred from the attempt to overdose. Since it's clear, I don't need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as the Zoloft overdose with a exact amount and timing (6 pills at 11:30). This indicates an action was taken, which goes beyond just planning. However, for categorization, this aligns with behavior or attempt rather than mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a past event (taking the pills at 11:30) and current physical effects, but the core is a described action that has already occurred. There are no references to future intentions beyond a question about safety.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete past action of overdosing, which fits the definition of an 'Attempt' as it involves a historic suicidal action (e.g., overdose). It goes beyond ideation or behavior because the attempt has already happened, and the rules specify that past attempts classify as 'Attempt.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of chronic stress, trauma, health deterioration (chronic fatigue syndrome), and a decision to end life. There are mentions of feeling calm and at peace about an impending action, implying suicide, as well as a vague reference to ""my plan."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of giving up on life. There are no explicit mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but phrases like ""destined to do it,"" ""I've made my decision,"" ""it's soon,"" and ""there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"" imply a desire to end one's life. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through indirect expressions of wanting to end life due to unbearable circumstances. Since it's not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts, this supports moving beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances; only a vague reference to ""my plan"" and ""Hope my plan works though."" 
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly; it's implied but not detailed. Given the uncertainty about explicit planning, I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""it's soon,"" ""my plan works""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not be alive) but lacks specific details on methods or preparations, making 'ideation' the best fit. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'indicator,' and it doesn't meet the threshold for 'behavior' due to the vague plan. No past attempts are mentioned, so it's not 'attempt.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, unemployment, and frustration with life. There are emotional indicators such as ongoing despair and a statement about realizing one is hopeless. There is no mention of death, dying, suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts, except for the phrase ""suicide forum,"" which implies thoughts related to suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to a ""suicide forum."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, but the desire to find a suicide forum suggests suicidal thoughts. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings of hopelessness (ongoing for months) and a current desire to find a forum, with no reference to past events or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit mention of suicide via the ""suicide forum,"" indicating suicidal thoughts or feelings without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of Ideation, as there is no evidence of planning or past attempts.

There are direct mentions of self-harm and dying, specifically ""slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. A specific method is mentioned (""slash my wrists""), but there are no clear signs of preparations or references to past suicide attempts, though ""I tried, I guess"" is vague and could refer to general efforts rather than suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I just want an end.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slash my wrists"" is a specific method of self-harm. Are there signs of preparation? No, such as acquiring tools or writing a note. Since a method is explicitly mentioned, this indicates a plan, but without further details, I must consider the guidelines to choose 'ideation' if unsure; however, the mention of a method aligns with 'behavior' criteria.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current or future intentions, such as being ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists."" The phrase ""I tried, I guess"" might hint at past events, but it's not specifically about a suicide attempt, so it's not clear enough to classify as past.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a mention of a specific method (""slash my wrists""), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves a plan. It goes beyond vague ideation due to the method description, so 'behavior' fits best.

247,how do I tell people my life is not able to be fixed. cause no-one I know has gone through the things I have gone through. they always say life will get better. That is the most bullshit phase I have ever heard. I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone. ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as feeling that life cannot be fixed, dismissing positive advice, and stating ""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone."" There are mentions of death and dying, specifically the user's desire to die to end pain. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life. There is a reference to preparing for funeral costs, which could imply some form of preparation for death. No specific methods, tools, or past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I cannot wait to die,"" which directly expresses a desire to not be alive. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in the statement about waiting to die to end pain.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or ways to end life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a mention of fixing funeral costs, which might suggest indirect preparation for death, but it is not explicit (e.g., no mention of a suicide note or acquiring means). Since this is uncertain, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., waiting to die and handling funeral costs), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die), fitting 'Ideation,' as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. While funeral costs could hint at preparation, it is not explicit enough to qualify as 'Behavior,' so I lean toward 'Ideation' to avoid overclassification.

(Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent)",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as questioning the point of life if it won't improve, describing past happiness that has ended, and stating a destiny of living a depressed life with a bleak future. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general dissatisfaction and a sense of pointlessness, but it does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to end one's life. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., past happiness) and current feelings of depression, but it does not indicate future intentions or past attempts related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts expressed, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions jumping from a bridge in NYC, seeking the one with the highest chance of death, and a timeline (""by the weekend""). There are indicators of intent to act, such as planning to choose a bridge soon. Emotional indicators include resignation (""I doubt anyone will answer me"") and a hope for success in the act (""wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want""). There are no mentions of death in a general sense, past attempts, or self-harm explicitly, but the bridge jumping implies a method of suicide.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, implied through ""jump from a bridge"" and ""highest chance of death.""
   - Emotional indicators: Resignation and determination, suggesting intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, specific method (jumping from a bridge), location (NYC bridges), and preparation (planning to choose by the weekend).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""jump from a bridge"" is a direct reference to a suicidal method.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through seeking the bridge with the highest chance of death and intending to act.
   - Since it's not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit intent, I will not automatically choose 'indicator'; instead, evaluate further.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, jumping from a bridge, with consideration of which one for better success.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user plans to select a bridge by the weekend, indicating active decision-making.
   - This is explicit enough for planning, so it goes beyond mere ideation; however, if uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here the plan is clear.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, it's focused on future actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die via bridge jumping) and a specific plan (method, location, and timeline). This fits 'Behavior' as it involves a plan with details like the method and preparations. It's not just ideation because of the specified method and intent to act soon. It's not 'Indicator' due to the clear suicidal references, and not 'Attempt' since no past action is described.

Not just them, I just need someone in my life who would see that I am trying, who would see that this is not who I want to be. But this is how it supposed to be, right? I supposed to be an alien, I supposed to suffer. This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain. I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include feelings of being misunderstood by parents, frustration with treatment, a sense of isolation, and expressions of suffering and hopelessness. The user describes feeling like an ""alien,"" destined to suffer, and states, ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen its grip."" There are emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""I will never die, I will never be free"" vaguely implies a desire for escape from pain, it does not directly express a wish to die. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or method, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future-oriented hopelessness (e.g., ""I will never be free""), but there are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, or a desire to die. It aligns with 'Indicator' as defined, since vague feelings about suffering and not being free do not constitute explicit suicidal expressions. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and suicide explicitly through the sister's completed suicide and the user's own past aborted attempt. Emotional indicators include pain, doubt, hopelessness, and a desire for a permanent end (e.g., ""it would be a welcome end to everything"" and ""the idea of that state lasting forever is hard to turn away from""). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for self-harm. References to past attempts are present (user's aborted attempt 6 years ago and sister's attempts).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through references to the sister's suicide and the user's past attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end"" and thoughts of permanent sleep.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates active preparation.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (sister's suicide and user's aborted attempt) but also current feelings of despair and thoughts of ending life. There are no indications of future intentions with planning.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desiring a permanent end) without any specific plan, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions of suicide and desires to die. It's not 'Behavior' as no plan or preparation is described. It's not 'Attempt' because while a past attempt is mentioned, the post focuses on current thoughts rather than solely historic actions, and no current plans are present.

There's no emotion anymore. No sadness, its just nothing. The pain in numb now, but that's nothing new. I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess. I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses deep disappointment, hopelessness, and emotional numbness. It mentions past efforts (graduating high school and college) leading to nothing, and a lack of hope or emotion. There are references to planning something (""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess"") and an apology to those who cared, implying self-harm or suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. Specific plans: ""in the tub"" suggests a method and location for suicide. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""doing it"" in context implies ending one's life. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through phrases like ""I can't continue this disappointment"" and the overall tone of despair.
   - Since it's not explicitly worded as ""suicide,"" but the intent is clear, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the planning element makes it more than vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""in the tub"" indicates a location and method (e.g., drowning or self-harm in water). 
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of minimizing mess suggests forethought, though not explicit acquisition of means.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, a specific plan is described, so it fits behavior criteria.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I plan on doing it""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) and a specific plan (method and location in the tub), which aligns with 'Behavior.' It goes beyond mere ideation due to the planning element, and it's not about past attempts, so 'Attempt' doesn't apply. Despite no direct word like ""suicide,"" the context clearly indicates a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a plea for a hug and a desire for pain to go away. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include distress or sadness related to pain, but it's vague and not explicitly tied to hopelessness or despair. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a general desire for pain relief, which is unclear and could mean emotional comfort, so I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there's no indication of any plan, this doesn't qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings (wanting a hug now and pain to go away), with no reference to past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post lacks any explicit mention of suicide, death, or suicidal thoughts. It only expresses general distress, which aligns with the 'indicator' category. Even if it implies dissatisfaction, without explicit suicide references, it fits 'indicator' best.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to end life, such as ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""wanting to end it."" There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, loneliness, trauma, epilepsy, body dysmorphia, anorexia, and addiction. The post details past experiences like childhood neglect, bullying, and self-harm behaviors (e.g., taking painkillers leading to addiction and physical harm), but no specific suicide plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. References to past self-harm (e.g., addiction to painkillers damaging the liver and starving oneself) are present, but they are not explicitly described as suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""wanting to end it,"" which directly express a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in the opening statements and overall narrative of despair.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plans for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only past coping mechanisms like taking painkillers are described, which do not constitute explicit preparation for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers extensively to past events (e.g., childhood trauma, bullying, and self-harm through addiction), but the suicidal expressions (e.g., ""IM GOING TO END IT"") indicate current or future intentions rather than a completed attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, fitting the 'Ideation' category, as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'Attempt' since no concrete past suicide attempt is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of wanting to die, past suicide attempts, no regret for those attempts, jealousy towards someone who succeeded in suicide, a belief in the right to end one's life, ongoing depression, intrusive thoughts, and a desire for medication to become a ""zombie"" until death. There are mentions of death, dying, and suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, anger, and dissatisfaction with life. Specific plans or methods are not detailed for current actions, though past attempts are referenced. No current preparations are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I have wanted to die"" and ""I should be able to kill myself.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, or preparations are described for current or future actions; only past attempts are referenced. Since there is no explicit current plan, this leans toward 'ideation' or another category, but we must evaluate overall.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., ""I had a few suicide attempts"" and a specific past attempt where the person was saved). It also expresses current feelings of wanting to die and hypothetical future desires (e.g., being put on Thorazine), but these are not framed as specific plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. While there are current suicidal thoughts, no specific current plans are mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. It is not 'Ideation' because the primary content centers on past attempts rather than just thoughts without action. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions. Based on the rules, when past attempts are described without current plans, 'Attempt' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""Trying to kill myself,"" indicating self-harm and suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, guilt, pain, anger, shame, and feelings of being a loser and abandoned. There are references to past attempts (""I feel shame for failing"") and future intentions (""I'm going to try again with a different method""). Specific plans are hinted at with ""a different method that's much easier and not so easy to back out of"" and ""unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off,"" suggesting some form of preparation or method involving calculation. 

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""end my own life"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., desire to try again, feelings of failure).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, vaguely, as ""a different method"" that is easier and involves potential issues like ""math is off,"" which could imply something like dosage for an overdose.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Indirectly, through references to methods and timing (e.g., ""tomorrow maybe""), but not explicit like acquiring tools.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""failing"" a previous attempt) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to try again,"" possibly tomorrow).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide and past attempts (""shame for failing""), and it also references current plans (""try again with a different method""). According to the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'.

I used to feel entertained and not in hell watching Judge Judy and Heidi Klum. Nope. I hate everything. No money will rot your brain. It's over. All I want is courage to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, such as ""A day feels like a month,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""Nothing to do,"" ""Reminded every second of others successes,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""No money will rot your brain,"" and ""It's over."" There is a mention of wanting ""courage to end it,"" which implies a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""All I want is courage to end it,"" which directly expresses a desire to not be alive. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as ""end it"" in this context implies ending one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions, particularly in the present tense with ""All I want is courage to end it."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as the desire to end one's life, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of Ideation, as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly implied, not just general distress. It is not Behavior due to the absence of a plan, and it is not Attempt as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I'm going out of this world,"" ""I'm offing myself,"" and ""Goodbye world."" These directly reference suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, as seen in ""I'm not worth living.""
   - There are signs of a specific plan, with the post mentioning a exact date and time (April 13, 2021, at 13:14 hours) for the action, but no explicit methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are described.
   - No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I'm offing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I'm not worth living"" and ""Goodbye world.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, substances, or detailed methods are referenced.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post specifies a date and time, which could imply preparation, but it's not explicit (e.g., no mention of a suicide note or acquiring means).
   - Since it's uncertain if this constitutes an explicit plan as defined (e.g., specific methods or preparations like those listed), I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions, as it describes an action to occur on a specific future date (April 13, 2021), rather than past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), which rules out 'indicator'.
   - It does not clearly mention a specific method or preparations beyond the time, so while there is a plan element, uncertainty leads to 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.
   - It is not about a past attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation', as it involves explicit suicidal desires without confirmed explicit planning.

I have to make it stop""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""I have to make it stop"" implies a vague desire to end the situation, it does not explicitly mention suicide or wanting to die. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so even if there were suicidal thoughts, it would not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and possible future intentions but does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of self-hatred, depression, feelings of failure as a parent and individual, hopelessness, and a desire to end life. There are mentions of not wanting to live, being comfortable with leaving this life, and identifying as suicidal, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described. Emotional indicators include despair, lack of motivation, and a sense of being a waste of space. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""I would say I'm suicidal"" and expresses comfort with leaving this life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""not wanting to live"" and implying a future possibility. Since these are explicit, it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. The user mentions not having the courage to act, so this lacks any indication of a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and future intentions (e.g., waiting until the son is an adult), but there are no descriptions of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to not be alive (e.g., ""I'm suicidal""), which fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of ongoing struggle, depression, and a desire to end life (""I just want off this life""). There are mentions of emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair through phrases such as ""struggling to hold on,"" ""been depressed and feeling like shit for years & years."" No mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the phrase ""I just want off this life,"" which indicates a desire to not be alive.
   - This is somewhat unclear in its directness, so leaning toward 'indicator' if in doubt; however, the expression aligns with a clear desire to end life, making it more than just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are referenced.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there's no indication of a plan, if it qualifies for ideation, it should not be behavior.

   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""struggling to hold on"" and ""I just want off this life""), with references to past depression (""been depressed for years & years""). No past attempts are described; it's focused on present state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (""I just want off this life""), which fits the definition of Ideation, as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned. It goes beyond general distress but lacks elements of planning, so it's not Behavior. There's no description of past attempts, ruling out Attempt.

There is a mention of ""By this time next week I'll be gone,"" which could imply death or not being alive, but it's vague and not directly tied to suicide. No explicit mentions of death, dying, or suicide are present. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and fatigue, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I'll be gone"" suggests a possible desire to not be alive, but it is indirect and vague. Since the instructions emphasize leaning toward 'indicator' if unclear, I will treat this as not explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to future intentions with ""By this time next week I'll be gone,"" but it is not explicit about suicide. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and a vague implication of not being alive, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""another attempt,"" which implies a previous suicide attempt. It also includes expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I just want to die"") and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as frustration with parental reactions and a desire to avoid them. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor any details about self-harm beyond the reference to a past attempt.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""another attempt"" strongly implies a suicide attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, phrases like ""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I don't want to survive another attempt,"" and ""I just want to die"" directly express a desire to die.
   - Since it's not entirely explicit (no direct ""suicide"" term), but the context is clear, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the implication is strong enough to move beyond that.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is mentioned, if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this doesn't seem to be the primary focus here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""another attempt"") while also expressing current desires to die, indicating ongoing suicidal thoughts. The past attempt is specifically described, suggesting a historical action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes a past suicide attempt (""another attempt""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. Although there are current expressions of suicidal desires, no specific current plans are mentioned, so it doesn't fit 'Behavior'. It goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the clear reference to a past attempt and isn't just 'Ideation' since the past action is the key element. The definition of 'Attempt' prioritizes descriptions of past attempts, and this post qualifies.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include discussions of past events involving suicidal actions, such as ""testing my method"" where the user went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped, and another event where they went in with the intention of dying but stopped themselves. There are mentions of suicide attempts, intentions to die, and vague suicidal behaviors from earlier in life. Emotional indicators include struggling with thoughts, distress, and it bothering them, showing hopelessness and ongoing rumination. No specific methods, plans, or preparations are detailed for current actions, but past actions are described. References to past attempts are present in the two events.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post discusses what constitutes a suicide attempt and describes events involving intentions to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the second event, the user states they went in with the intention of dying.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, indirectly, as in ""testing my method,"" which implies a method was involved in the past events, but it's not detailed for current use.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly for current actions; the preparations seem to be from past events.
   - If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the focus is on past actions rather than current planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to past events (e.g., ""both of these happened long enough ago""), with no clear current or future intentions mentioned. The user notes they are in a better situation now, but the post revolves around reflecting on past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes past attempts at suicide, including concrete actions like testing a method and going through with an intention to die (even if stopped). This aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions where something was actively done, rather than just thoughts or current plans. There are no indications of current suicidal behavior or ideation dominating the content, so 'Attempt' is the best fit.

My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are mentioned, nor are there signs of preparation.
   - References to past attempts: No references to past suicide attempts; only past experiences like childhood bullying and abuse are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I really want to die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I really want to die"" and ""I'd rather die than submit.""
   - The mentions are clear and direct, so this supports moving beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated.
   - Since no plan is evident, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, despair, and a desire to not exist, such as ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" and ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all."" Emotional indicators include feelings of betrayal, loneliness, failure, and general dissatisfaction with life. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm directly tied to the user. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I don't want to be here anymore"" and ""I want out so bad"" indicate a desire to not be alive. However, the overall context is vague and leans toward general distress, with the nuclear bomb reference being about everyone, not specifically the user.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. The post expresses wishes but not concrete plans, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""I don't want to be here anymore""), which fits the definition of Ideation as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. There is no explicit mention of suicide itself, but the desires qualify as more than just general distress. Based on the rules, this is Ideation rather than Indicator, as the expressions go beyond vague dissatisfaction.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a reference to past self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago""), feelings of neglect from family and coworkers, emotional distress such as hopelessness and tiredness, and a statement implying a desire for death (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""). There are mentions of emotional indicators like despair and lack of care, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past suicide attempts are explicitly stated, only self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free,"" which implies a desire for death. Since this is not entirely unclear but leans toward an expression of suicidal thoughts, it qualifies as an indicator of ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no details about tools, locations, or preparations, this does not reach the level of behavior; if uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (self-harm two months ago) and current feelings of distress and desire for death, but does not describe future intentions or plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire for death) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to the implied desire to die, nor 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, nor 'Attempt' as the past self-harm is not explicitly described as a suicide attempt.

I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get.

I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much. At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much. I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, sadness, and ongoing suicidal thoughts. There are mentions of suicide, such as ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I think about suicide every day,"" and ""seriously consider it once a week."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as the user describes feeling alone and carrying a burden for seven years. Specific plans are referenced with ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" and ""long conversations with myself about suicide."" There are no references to past attempts, and no specific methods, tools, or locations are detailed in the post itself, but the act of writing plans suggests some level of preparation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal I get,"" ""think about suicide every day,"" and ""seriously consider it."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user describes increasing suicidal feelings and considerations.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly in the post (e.g., no details on tools or substances), but the user states ""I write detailed plans in my journal,"" which implies the existence of specific plans or ideas about how to commit suicide. This could be seen as a form of preparation. Since the post mentions plans, even if not fully detailed here, it aligns with indicators of planning, so I lean toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing experiences, such as daily thoughts and weekly serious considerations, with no mention of past attempts. It's focused on present feelings and fears about the future.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions writing detailed plans, which qualifies as explicit planning or preparation. This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it goes beyond mere ideation by including elements of planning, even if methods aren't spelled out in the post. If there were no mention of plans, it might be 'Ideation,' but the journal details push it to 'Behavior.'

There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but they are general rather than specific. There are no references to specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post expresses unbearable pain but does not directly state a desire to die. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include an explicit mention of ""committing suicide"" and a reference to being capable of doing so sober, likely linked to AA (Alcoholics Anonymous). There are emotional indicators of a sense of empowerment or capability regarding suicide, which could imply underlying distress or hopelessness. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post expresses capability of committing suicide, indicating suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no details about tools, locations, or preparations, this does not qualify as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a current assessment of capability (e.g., ""I think I'm capable""), suggesting present or future intentions rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., capability of committing suicide) but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of ""Ideation,"" as it involves desires or thoughts about suicide without detailing a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of distress, self-loathing (""drunk because I'm a piece of shit""), hopelessness (""I hate every part of my life""), and a desire for it to end (""I just want it to be over"" – assuming typos like ""o just want tit"" mean ""I just want it""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show despair and exhaustion (""I'm sick and tired""), but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though phrases like ""I just want it to be over"" suggest vague dissatisfaction, it does not directly state a desire to die. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no evidence of planning, if it were to qualify for a higher category, it would be 'ideation' over 'behavior', but based on the lack of explicit mentions, it doesn't reach that level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""Don't want to do this anymore""), with no mention of past events or attempts. It is focused on the present state of mind.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and a vague desire for life to end, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide or wanting to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and in cases of doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'. There are no plans, methods, or past attempts, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' do not apply.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in ""attempted suicide 11 times"" and ""I will use my suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the references to past attempts and the future use of suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, substances, locations, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing notes is mentioned.
   - Since no specific plan is detailed, this leans toward not being 'behavior,' but the post includes other elements to consider.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past events (""attempted suicide 11 times"") and future intentions (""I will use my suicide"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, with the mention of 11 attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which fits the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current or future intentions (""I will use my suicide""), and per the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt.' It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, 'Ideation' because of the past attempts, or 'Behavior' as there are no specific plans or methods.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers primarily to past events (e.g., breakup, depression, job loss, and suicide attempts) but also expresses current feelings of distress. There are no indications of future intentions or plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, it states ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now,"" indicating concrete past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of extreme emotional distress such as hopelessness, despair, loneliness, abandonment issues, physical pain, and anxiety. There are direct mentions of death and suicide, including phrases like ""accomplish death,"" ""shooting myself through my upper palate,"" ""looked into other options"" (e.g., overdosing), and ""End it now."" Emotional indicators show profound despair, such as ""I'm in hell,"" ""things tend to get worse,"" and ""It doesn't get better."" Specific plans or methods are referenced, including shotguns, handguns (with details on caliber), shooting through the mouth, and overdosing. There are no clear references to past suicide attempts by the user, though general health issues and fear of failed attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""don't kill yourself,"" ""accomplish death,"" ""shooting myself,"" and ""End it now.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""accomplish death"" and the overall tone urging to ""End it now.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, including shotguns, handguns (discussing caliber differences), shooting through the upper palate, and overdosing (referencing Mark Linkous). This indicates consideration of means and methods.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions having ""looked into other options,"" which suggests research or active consideration, though not full-blown acquisition of means.
   - Since specific methods are detailed, this goes beyond vague thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This primarily refers to current and future intentions, with ongoing distress and explicit planning for suicide. There are no descriptions of past attempts by the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and includes specific methods (e.g., handguns, overdosing), which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It exceeds 'Ideation' due to the details on methods, and there are no past attempts described, so it's not 'Attempt.' It's not 'Indicator' because of the explicit suicide references.

There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., wanting to ""sleep and never wake up""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns best with 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'Indicator', and there's no plan for 'Behavior' or past attempt for 'Attempt'.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out? I want to be done, I want to be out of this and I wish I could just sleep for now but I can't. I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a metaphorical description of feeling trapped and out of control in a car with no brakes, expressing constant anxiety, sadness, and a desire for it to stop. There are mentions of death and dying implied through the idea of crashing into another car to end the situation, with fear of not dying from it. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, anxiety, and a sense of pointlessness. Specific plans or methods are suggested with ""crashing into another car"" as a way to stop the feelings, and ""frequently come close to doing it,"" which implies thoughts of acting on this method. There are no references to past attempts or explicit preparations like acquiring tools.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, as the post describes wanting to crash to end the anxiety and sadness, with fear of surviving. Since this is not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit desires, it goes beyond vague expressions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Specific methods are mentioned, such as crashing into another car, which is a clear method for ending life. There are no signs of preparation like writing a note or acquiring means, but the phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests intent toward this method. Given the definitions, this constitutes specific ideas of how to commit suicide, so it qualifies as more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings and intentions (""frequently come close to doing it""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post goes beyond general distress by explicitly describing suicidal thoughts and a specific method (crashing the car), which aligns with 'Behavior' as it includes explicit planning. Although not fully prepared, the mention of a method and coming close to acting on it fits the criteria for 'Behavior' over 'Ideation', per the guidelines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death as an option and a hypothetical scenario of dying in an accident without suffering. There are no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, or dying by one's own hand. Emotional indicators show a passive acceptance of death but not strong hopelessness or despair.

No; the user states, ""I won't commit,"" and frames death as a passive outcome (e.g., an accident), not a desired action. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or means, so this does not qualify as planning. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's no indication of any plan at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current thoughts or hypothetical scenarios, not past events or future intentions to act. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses a vague idea about death not being the worst outcome but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, such as having ""the stuff prepared"" and referring to a year of planning.

   - This refers to current and future intentions (""Tonight is the last chance,"" ""I won't lose the opportunity""), not past events. There is mention of past planning but no description of a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill me"") and mentions of a plan/preparations (""stuff prepared,"" past planning leading to tonight).

   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and includes a specific plan (starvation as a method), which aligns with 'Behavior.' It goes beyond mere ideation due to the described method, and there's no reference to past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt.' It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

295,"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it. Nothing is happening and I don't believe my environment facilitates forward moment. Therefore it is probably best I head out before it gets worse. If nothing changes, the fuck am I getting up in the morning for?",1,ideation,"<thinking>

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are mentioned. The thoughts are general and not detailed, so this does not qualify as explicit planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of self-harm (""I just slit my wrists""), death and dying (""my death will only benefit people,"" ""I won't have much time to live,"" ""Goodbye""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""I have been so distant,"" ""I am not a good person,"" ""I just want to get it over with""). There are specific plans and methods described, such as looking at pictures of the radial artery, marking it, and using a dremel with a saw attachment. No references to past attempts are present; this focuses on a recent action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned through descriptions of self-harm and intent to die (Yes). There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), as seen in phrases like ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""if you are seeing this then it's already too late.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), including tools like a dremel and saw attachment, as well as preparations such as marking the artery based on pictures and graphs. Signs of preparation are evident (e.g., typing the post beforehand).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers primarily to a current or very recent event (""I just slit my wrists""), with implications of an imminent or just-completed action. It does not describe past attempts but focuses on what has just happened.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action that has occurred (self-harm with intent to end life), which aligns with ""Attempt"" as it involves a historic action in the immediate past. Although it includes elements of planning and behavior, the emphasis on the completed act makes ""Attempt"" the best fit, per the definition that prioritizes descriptions of past actions.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself. Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of suicide (e.g., ""I'm suicidal myself""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I don't want to keep going myself,"" and the user's internal conflict about advising their friend), and references to the user's own suicidal feelings. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts by the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I'm suicidal myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I don't want to keep going myself""). Since these are explicit, this leans toward a category beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of any plan or method, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., the user's ongoing struggle), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to not continue living) but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. There are no past attempts mentioned, so 'Attempt' does not apply, and it's not vague enough to be 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die, feelings of hopelessness, despair, and emotional exhaustion. Specifically, the user mentions ""I wanted to die when I made that post"" (a direct reference to wanting to die) and describes ongoing feelings of desperation, no hope, and life feeling like meaningless torture. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair throughout, such as ""I have no hope"" and ""I just feel like breaking."" However, there are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor any references to past attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user states ""I wanted to die,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive. There are no unclear elements here, so this confirms explicit suicidal thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current and recent feelings, such as ""I wanted to die when I made that post"" (a past moment in the context of the current situation), but it focuses on ongoing desperation rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' best, as it involves desires to not be alive without detailing how to act on them. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned; not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan; and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses deep emotional distress, including feelings of being ""broken,"" identity confusion (""I'm a man that feels like a woman but could never be a woman""), and a sense of being trapped (""My being in itself is a prison""). It mentions causing pain to others and general hopelessness. There is a direct phrase ""I'm better off dead,"" which indicates a desire to die. No mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the phrase ""I'm better off dead,"" which expresses a desire to not be alive.
   - Since there is a direct expression of wanting to die, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as it's not just vague dissatisfaction.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of ending life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward acting on thoughts.
   - Since there is no evidence of a plan, this would not qualify as behavior; if uncertain, I should choose ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past actions (""All I've done for the past few months""), but the suicidal expression (""I'm better off dead"") is in the present tense, indicating current feelings. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I'm better off dead""), which fits the definition of ideation as it shows a desire to not be alive without any specific plan. There is no mention of methods or preparations, so it's not behavior. It's not just general distress, as there's a clear desire to die, making it more than indicator. No past attempts are referenced, so it's not attempt. Therefore, ideation is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include references to suicide, such as ""killing myself,"" ""set a date,"" ""letters were written,"" and ""had a set plan which I was days away from going through with."" Emotional indicators include past pain, desperation, and now hope, with mentions of life challenges and improvement. There are signs of preparations (e.g., writing letters and setting a date) but no specific methods like tools or substances. No references to actual self-harm or completed attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""set a date"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the past tense (e.g., coming close to killing oneself).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods (e.g., no tools or substances), but preparations are mentioned (e.g., letters written and a set plan). This indicates planning without detailed methods.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., writing letters and setting a date).
   - Since there is clear mention of a plan, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events (e.g., ""I came extraordinarily close,"" ""letters were written,"" ""I was days away""), with no indication of current or future intentions. No past attempts that actually occurred are described, only preparations that did not lead to action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post lacks any current suicidal thoughts, so it's not 'ideation' for present desires. It explicitly mentions a plan and preparations in the past, which aligns with 'behavior' as it includes expressions of suicidal thoughts along with a plan (e.g., letters and set date). It's not 'attempt' because no concrete action (like an overdose) actually happened—only planning occurred. It's not 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of regret for not ""doing it"" years ago, which implies suicidal thoughts. There are mentions of wishing not to be alive, wanting things to be over since 2012, and ongoing anger about not acting on those thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, regret, and anger at oneself for continuing to live. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools or locations. References to past attempts are not present; it's about past thoughts rather than actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" and ""wish that I had just done it so that I wouldn't be here now."" These phrases indicate a desire to not be alive, so this is a Yes for direct expressions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. It's purely about general regrets and wishes, without any concrete plan, so I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past thoughts (e.g., since 2012) and ongoing feelings (e.g., current anger and wishes), but it does not describe any actual past attempts. It's focused on historical ideation rather than current plans or executed actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing how.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""suicidal,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""wanting to die."" Emotional indicators show despair and hopelessness, like ""I'm depressed and suicidal"" and ""It sucks so much."" There are signs of preparation, including having written a suicide note that specifies what to give to people, and thoughts about canceling things to avoid burdening family. No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) or self-harm behaviors are detailed, and there are no references to past suicide attempts, only to the note as a past action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicidal,"" ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""wanting to die,"" ""get ready to die"").
   - This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are specified.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post mentions writing a suicide note and thinking about canceling administrative tasks, which align with preparations for suicide.
   - Since preparations like a suicide note are explicitly referenced, this suggests planning, fitting the 'behavior' category. However, as per the rules, if unsure, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here the evidence of preparation is sufficient.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers mainly to current and future intentions, such as ongoing thoughts of suicide and getting ready to die. The writing of the note is a past action, but it's tied to current suicidal ideation rather than a described past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and signs of preparation (e.g., suicide note), which meets the criteria for 'behavior.' It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of preparations, and there's no description of a past attempt, so 'attempt' doesn't apply. It's not just general distress, so 'indicator' is not appropriate.

No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used directly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the phrase implies a strong current suicidal state. This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (the trespassing yesterday) but the suicidal feelings appear to be current. There are no descriptions of past attempts, only the current emotional state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""ive never been more suicidal in my life""), which fits 'ideation' as it expresses a desire related to not wanting to live without any specific plan or method. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

It expresses views on societal control, slavery to a fascist regime, and the illusion of democracy with no freedom. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair about society, but these are general and not personal. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The content focuses on societal issues rather than personal suicidal thoughts, so I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so no need to consider 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to historical events (e.g., Hitler, Auschwitz) and current societal perceptions, but not to any personal past events, attempts, or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general dissatisfaction and hopelessness about life and society but does not explicitly mention suicide, wanting to die, or any plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there are no explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

My family doesn't love me, my friends just put up with me, I get mocked by people I barely know online, it just hurts so much. I just want someone to like me, anybody. I'm nobodies first choice or even second choice, nobody seems to think about me at all. I feel so alone in the world, and I'm soon going to go to college, where I will no absolutely nobody. Its seems so terrifying. I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, feeling unloved and unwanted by family, friends, and others, fear of going to college alone, and a desire to go to Heaven to be with Jesus. There are mentions of wanting to die, specifically ""I just want to die and go to Heaven,"" which indicates a wish for death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and isolation. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I just want to die and go to Heaven."" Since this is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive, it leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Therefore, this does not qualify as having a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings of loneliness and future fears (e.g., going to college), with the desire to die presented as a current wish. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die, which fits the definition of suicidal ideation (a desire to not be alive without a specific plan). It is not 'Indicator' because of the direct mention of wanting to die. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of any plan or method. It is not 'Attempt' as there are no descriptions of past actions.

I have this hoplessness feeling like i'm stuck inside of a nightmare but i don't wake up and ugh. i'm sorry but right now i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress, such as feelings of hopelessness, despair, and being stuck in a nightmare. There are mentions of death through the phrase ""Life is worse than death,"" and suicide is explicitly stated with ""i'm considering suicide."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, family conflicts, and a sense of being ignored. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly says ""i'm considering suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""Life is worse than death"" and ""i can't fucking take it anymore."" Since it is explicit, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated. Since there is no explicit plan, this fits ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and intentions, as indicated by ""Right now i'm considering suicide."" There are no references to past events or past attempts; it is focused on the present.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., considering suicide and wanting to die), but there is no mention of a specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of Ideation, as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing how. It does not qualify as Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, nor as Behavior due to the absence of a plan, and not as Attempt since no past actions are described.

311,"I want to help my suicidal online friend who has been through literal hell but I don't know how and I'm scared. I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks. Sorry for the post that is all over the place I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user's concern for their friend who has experienced suicide attempts, abuse, mental health issues (e.g., insomnia, lucid dreams of hanging, borderline personality disorder, bipolar, abandonment issues, eating disorders), and the user's own emotional state.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: The post explicitly mentions the friend's suicide attempts and the user's own suicidality (""I'm suicidal myself"").
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses fear, confusion, hopelessness, and a breakdown, indicating distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned for the user. The friend's past attempts are referenced, but not in detail as plans.
   - References to past attempts: The post refers to the friend's past suicide attempts, but not the user's.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""I'm suicidal myself,"" which is an explicit mention related to themselves.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, for the user, as they directly say they are suicidal.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is clear, so no need to lean.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned for the user.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation for the user.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no indication of planning, so this aligns with ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The user's statement (""I'm suicidal myself"") refers to their current state, with no mention of past or future intentions for themselves.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past attempts are described for the user; only for the friend.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post focuses on the user's own suicidality with the explicit statement ""I'm suicidal myself,"" which indicates suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves explicit expressions of suicidal feelings but lacks planning. The suicide risk is only for the person writing the post (the user), not the friend. Therefore, based on the analysis, 'Ideation' is the best category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct pleas to ""kill me"" and ""end my life,"" which indicate a desire for death. Emotional indicators show despair and pain through the begging language. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""kill me,"" ""end my life""). Since these are clear expressions of a desire to not be alive, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Without explicit planning, this should be classified as ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions, as the language is in the present tense (e.g., ""Just kill me""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) but lacks the elements of planning (Behavior) or past actions (Attempt).

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to end their own life based on a utilitarian perspective, self-directed anger affecting relationships, and a belief that their existence causes more harm than good. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and internal conflict, as they question their decision and seek validation. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the user expresses a desire to end their life based on logical reasoning.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so this is not 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only abstract thoughts about the decision are discussed.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current thoughts and future intentions (e.g., questioning if ending their life is the right decision), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires (e.g., wanting to end life), but lacks any specific plan or method, making it 'ideation'. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'behavior' due to no plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

I won't ever be happy in this world and how it is now. Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure. I'm from the UK, so i can't get hold of a gun which would solve everything. Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme tiredness, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, with phrases like ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""I'm so tired,"" ""I won't ever be happy,"" and ""Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure."" It mentions death or dying indirectly through ""end it all"" and references a gun as a way to ""solve everything."" Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods beyond the gun reference, or preparations. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end it all"" and implying suicide via the gun reference.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I don't want it anymore"" and questioning options to end life.
   - The mentions are not extremely vague, so this leans toward explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a gun is mentioned as a potential method that would ""solve everything.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of acquiring means or taking steps; it's hypothetical.
   - Since specific ideas of a method (gun) are mentioned, according to the guidelines, this should be considered under 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., wishing for options to end it), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not be alive) and mentions a specific method (gun), which aligns with the rule in the Ideation definition that specific ideas of methods should be classified as 'behavior.' There is no actual preparation or plan described, but the mention of a method tips it to 'behavior' per the guidelines. Thus, 'behavior' is the best fit.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses past self-harm (cutting), emotional distress, disbelief from others, and vague thoughts about life not being worth it. There are mentions of past self-harm attempts, scars, and feelings of numbness and emptiness. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, crying, and isolation. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for future actions are mentioned. References to past attempts are present, such as the incident a few months ago where the user harmed themselves.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, but there are references to self-harm and vague expressions like ""wonder if it's even worth it anymore,"" which imply thoughts of not wanting to live.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, it's not direct, so leaning toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context includes a described past action.
   
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, cutting is mentioned, but only in the context of past actions, not as a current or future plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates current preparations.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here it's about past events.
   
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers mainly to past events (e.g., the self-harm incident a few months ago) with some current emotional distress, but no explicit future intentions. Past attempts are specifically described.
   
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a concrete past action (self-harm attempt), which fits the 'Attempt' category as it involves a historical event where the user took action to harm themselves. Even though there's vague current ideation, the presence of a past attempt takes precedence per the definitions.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""suicidal ideation"" and ""act on my suicidal thoughts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through references to suicidal thoughts, though not phrased as a direct desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of any preparations like notes or acquiring means.

320,"I hope I die soon. I have started to do heroin pretty much daily. Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses a desire to die (""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead""), mentions ongoing self-harm through daily heroin use, references past negative experiences with antipsychotics, and shows emotional indicators like anger, hopelessness, and resentment towards family and friends.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: There are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident in phrases like ""it just kills me inside,"" ""Fuck them!,"" and overall dissatisfaction with life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Daily heroin use is mentioned as an ongoing behavior, which could be a method for self-harm leading to death. It implies preparation through regular substance use.
   - References to past attempts: There is a reference to a past experience with antipsychotics, but it does not describe a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through expressions like ""I hope I die soon,"" which directly indicate a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in the phrases above.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, daily heroin use is described, which can be a method for self-harm or suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the ongoing daily use of heroin suggests preparation or engagement in behavior that could lead to death.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is uncertainty about whether this is a deliberate plan versus ongoing behavior, but the mention of a method (heroin) tips toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It references a past event (taking antipsychotics), but focuses on current behavior (heroin use) and future intentions (""Soon I will be finally dead"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and mentions self-harming behavior (daily heroin use as a potential method). This aligns with 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning or exhibition of self-harming actions. Although not a detailed plan, the heroin use qualifies under the definition of preparations or methods.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a reference to using a gun to hit the brain stem, which implies a method for self-harm or ending life. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, as the user expresses not caring about family, regrets, or reasons to live. No specific preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, indirectly through the query about gun positioning and dismissing reasons to live. Since it's not fully explicit but leans toward indication, I would note this as present, but per rules, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. However, the context strongly suggests suicidal intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as using a gun and targeting the brain stem, which is a clear reference to a lethal method. There are no signs of preparation like acquiring tools, but the description of the method qualifies as explicit planning. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's evident enough to consider it a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is asking about the best way to act, rather than describing past events. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not care about living) and mentions a specific method (gun position for brain stem), which aligns with 'Behavior'. It goes beyond vague ideation due to the plan element, so 'Behavior' fits best, as per the definition requiring explicit planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of ""killing myself"" (indicating suicidal thoughts), persistent thoughts that ""won't leave my head,"" and references to worsening life circumstances. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""everything just keeps getting worse."" The post also mentions past self-harm scars, but does not detail any specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past suicide attempts are explicitly stated, only self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it describes constant thoughts about killing oneself. Since these are clear, this leans toward a category beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations like writing a note. This indicates no explicit planning, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current and ongoing thoughts (""hasn't been a single day,"" ""it won't leave my head""), with a mention of past self-harm scars. However, the self-harm is not described as a suicide attempt, so it does not shift to 'attempt' category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill oneself), which fits 'ideation' as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'attempt' as no past suicide attempt is detailed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit references to suicide attempts, such as ""I'm going to attempt again,"" past overdoses (""I've tried to overdose three times""), wanting to die (""I want to die""), self-hatred, hopelessness, and a farewell (""Goodbye""). Emotional indicators show deep despair, tiredness, and resignation. Specific plans are implied with ""Just a few more hours,"" and past methods like overdosing are mentioned. References to past attempts are clear, including three overdoses and a first attempt earlier in the year.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly stated, but the timing suggests intent. Since the post mentions a plan to attempt again, this leans toward explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., three overdoses and a first attempt) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""going to attempt again in a few hours""). The post combines historical actions with immediate plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes past suicide attempts and also mentions current plans. According to the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and includes current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'.

   - Key elements include expressions of personal struggles such as family issues, trauma from a friend's death, parental problems, isolation, and alcoholism. There are mentions of death (e.g., friend's drowning, mother's health issues), which indicate emotional pain but not directly the user's own death or suicide. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore,"" ""I just want this pain to end"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" suggests distress but is vague and not a direct expression of suicidal intent. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers mainly to past events (e.g., friend's drowning, family issues) and current feelings of distress, but there are no indications of future intentions or past attempts by the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry.

What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses a relapse into self-harm after four months of abstinence, triggered by various problems and panic attacks. It mentions promises to family and a partner to stop self-harm, current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now""), and explicit thoughts about suicide (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and frustration. There are references to past self-harm but no specific past suicide attempts. No specific methods, plans, or preparations for suicide are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only current self-harm is described, but not as preparation for suicide.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the instructions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (four months without self-harm), current behavior (ongoing self-harm), and immediate future intentions (implied in suicidal thoughts), but focuses more on present feelings rather than past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die), but lacks any specific plan or method for suicide. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation' best, as it involves suicidal feelings without the elements required for 'Behavior'. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, and not 'Attempt' since no past suicide attempt is described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""blow my head off"" and ""i fucking deserve death."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, with ""please kill me"" and the overall tone.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my head off"" implies a method (e.g., gunshot). Are there signs of preparation? No, such as no mention of acquiring tools or writing notes. Since a specific method is referenced, this aligns with the rule to classify as 'behavior' if methods are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""blow my head off""), which fits the 'behavior' category as it includes a plan. It goes beyond 'ideation' due to the method, and it's not 'attempt' since no past action is described. It's also not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of lifelong failure in various roles (son, brother, etc.), deep self-hatred, isolation, substance abuse, and explicit references to suicide attempts. Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: Yes, the user states ""I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and describes taking ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" with the hope of not waking up. Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and fear are evident throughout. Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user mentions using substances (muscle relaxers and pain killers) as a method for self-harm. References to past attempts: Yes, the user describes two failures in the last 4 days, including a specific incident yesterday.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and the description of hoping not to wake up after taking pills.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user details taking muscle relaxers and pain killers as a method for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills implies preparation, as they had access to and used these substances.
   - Since this involves actual actions rather than just thoughts, it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers primarily to past events, such as the two failed attempts in the last 4 days, including the specific overdose yesterday. It also touches on current feelings of despair, but the focus is on historic actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes past suicide attempts, such as the overdose, which fits the 'Attempt' category as it involves concrete actions that have already occurred. While there are elements of ideation in the expressions of wanting to die, the explicit mention of past attempts takes precedence. The rules specify that if a post refers to past attempts, it should be classified as 'Attempt,' even if current feelings are present.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of feeling like a burden, social isolation (e.g., not leaving the house since age 14), lack of employment, living at home, and spending all day in bed.

No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general distress and dissatisfaction with life, but without any explicit reference to suicide. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator'.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""end it all,"" ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't"" (likely a misspelling or slang for commit suicide), and expressions of relief in being free to pursue these thoughts. It mentions emotional indicators such as hopelessness (e.g., no one worth staying alive for), despair, and a sense of liberation from past obligations. There are references to future intentions like ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" and ""decide to end it,"" which suggest preparation without detailing specific methods. No mentions of past attempts are present.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, explicit terms like ""kill myself"" and ""end it all.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools or locations) are mentioned, but phrases like ""looking into my options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"" imply general preparation.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, implied through ""looking into my options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row,"" but these are vague and not explicit.
   - Since the planning is not specific or detailed, and the rules instruct to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure, I will classify it as ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers mainly to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""finally free to end it all""), with brief mentions of past obligations but no description of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), fitting 'ideation.' There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'

All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak.

The lockdown and cold winter put everything that much more true. I've never felt as alone as I did there. I was very depressed, bored and lots of anxiety. Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write.

Emotional indicators include expressions of hopelessness and despair, like ""really depressed and sad,"" ""crying basically all night and now this morning,"" and ""idk what to do."" There is a specific plan mentioned: ""Probably by trying to overdose."" Additionally, there is a reference to past attempts with the word ""again.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as seen in phrases like ""end myself"" and ""end it."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), indicating a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), such as ""overdose.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I'm at the end,"" ""My death will release my pain""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I can't fight anymore,"" ""I can't try anymore,"" ""life and its pain""), and a sense of inevitability. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""my time is coming to an end"" and ""My death will release my pain,"" which imply a desire to end one's life. Since this is not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts, it qualifies as an indicator of ideation rather than just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. This is purely expressive without concrete planning, so I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to die (e.g., inevitability of death and release from pain) but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'Ideation.'

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE.

   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' if not for other factors, but we'll evaluate fully in the next step.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., previous suicide attempt and hospitalization) as well as current/future intentions (e.g., fear of dying after the mother's passing). The past attempt is specifically described as a concrete action that led to hospitalization.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (hospitalization), which fits the 'Attempt' category as it involves a historic concrete action. Although there are current expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), no explicit current plans are mentioned, but the presence of past attempts takes precedence. According to the rules, if a post refers to past attempts, it should be classified as 'Attempt,' even with current ideation.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of severe emotional distress from a breakup, such as hopelessness, mental battles, replaying memories, disturbing dreams, and feelings of weakness. There are mentions of being ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it,"" which vaguely suggest weariness with life and possibly ending suffering, but no direct references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair, hopelessness, and frustration from failed coping attempts (e.g., Prozac, new activities). No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" imply distress, they are not direct or explicit expressions of suicidal desires. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's not even at the level of ideation due to lack of explicit suicidal thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events (e.g., breakup 6 months ago and starting Prozac in December) and current ongoing struggles, but there are no references to past suicide attempts or clear future intentions beyond vague distress.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and vague feelings of being tired of living, but without any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, I must choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There are no elements of ideation, behavior, or attempt present.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life, such as ""I don't want to anymore,"" ""I hate cooking, I hate cleaning,"" and references to feeling exhausted and depressed. There are mentions of death and suicide: specifically, ""constantly contemplate suicide"" and ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness about the future, loss of enjoyment in activities, and a sense of being ""fucked up"" by external factors. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""constantly contemplate suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all."" This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is indicated, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and ongoing contemplation (e.g., ""I don't want to anymore"" and ""constantly contemplate suicide""), rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as contemplating suicide and wishing not to be alive, which fits the definition of Ideation. There is no specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as Behavior. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and it is not Attempt as there are no references to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""suicide is better""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., describing years of trauma, OCD, anhedonia, no friends, abuse, and feeling life is a ""bust""), and references to a desire for ""release."" There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""suicide is better"" and ""the release is better,"" which imply a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no details about tools, locations, or preparations, this does not qualify as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., struggles since age 12 or 13) but focuses on current feelings and future intentions (e.g., questioning if suicide is better now). No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire for ""release"" and questioning the value of continuing life, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with ""Ideation,"" as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. It is not ""Indicator"" due to the explicit mention of suicide, not ""Behavior"" due to the absence of a plan, and not ""Attempt"" as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions wanting to ""go sleep forever,"" which is a euphemism for death. It includes specific substances: 58 pieces of 100 mg Seroquel and various Viepax pills (likely antidepressants), indicating potential means for self-harm via overdose. Emotional indicators include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""can't take this shit no more"" and ""I'm sick and tired of my shitty life."" There are no mentions of death, suicide, or self-harm explicitly by name, but the context implies it. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wanna go sleep forever"" directly expresses a desire to die.
   - Since this is a clear expression of wanting to die, it goes beyond vague distress, but I'll consider the context for the next steps.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies quantities of medications (Seroquel and Viepax), which could be used for an overdose, indicating a potential method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, stating possession of these substances suggests preparation for self-harm.
   - If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the mention of specific medications and quantities qualifies as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current intentions, as the language (""I wanna go sleep forever"" and ""I have"" the pills) indicates present desires and possessions, not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die (""wanna go sleep forever"") and mentions specific preparations (quantities of medications), which align with 'behavior' as it involves a plan or method. It goes beyond just ideation because of the detailed mention of means. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I'm depressed and miserable,"" ""stuck in a loveless marriage with no way out,"" ""It hurts""), and general dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""It's not fair to people to have to deal with me""). There are no mentions of death in a broader sense beyond the desire to die, no references to suicide explicitly, no self-harm, and no specific plans, methods, or preparations. There are also no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive.""
   - Since the expressions are direct about wanting to die but do not use the word ""suicide,"" I am considering the definitions. The Ideation category includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., desire to not be alive), so this leans toward Ideation rather than Indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of ending life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is indicated.
   - Since there is no evidence of a plan, and the instructions say to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this does not qualify as Behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ongoing depression and misery), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (fitting Ideation) but lacks any specific plan or method (ruling out Behavior). It goes beyond general distress without mentioning suicide, so it's not Indicator. There's no reference to past attempts, so it's not Attempt. Therefore, the best category is Ideation.

I want this to end but I am scared.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of past attempts at self-harm (e.g., trying with a knife and bailing out multiple times), specific methods like a knife and a rope, a potential location (a building), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I hate myself so much,"" ""I want this to end,"" ""I am scared""). There are references to past attempts, current possession of means (rope), and considerations of future actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned through descriptions of past tries and desires to end life (e.g., ""I have tried... I tried with a knife,"" ""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die, so this is a clear yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (knife for past attempt, rope as current possession, building as a potential location). There are signs of preparation (having a rope and considering a building, though not fully checked). This indicates explicit planning, which would typically lean toward 'behavior', but I must consider the overall context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (multiple attempts, trying with a knife), as well as current and future intentions (having a rope, needing to do it, not wanting to bail out anymore).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes past attempts (e.g., trying with a knife), which aligns with 'Attempt'. Additionally, it mentions current plans (e.g., having a rope and considering a building), and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also includes current plans, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. This overrides other categories like 'Behavior', as the explicit rule prioritizes 'Attempt' in such cases.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness, such as ""Tired of it. No point to anything in life with depression,"" ""I feel pain and i just want to end it,"" and repeated self-deprecation like ""Im honestly just so useless"" and ""im useless."" There are indications of a desire to die through the phrase ""I just want to end it,"" which implies ending one's life. However, there are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor any references to past attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""I just want to end it"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life. Although it's not using explicit terms like ""kill myself,"" it qualifies as an expression of suicidal thoughts. Given the guidelines, this is clear enough for ideation, but if there were doubt, I would lean toward 'indicator'; however, it's sufficiently direct here.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior,' and I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and intentions, with no mention of past events or attempts. It is focused on the present state of mind.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (""I just want to end it""), which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without any specific plan. It is not 'indicator' because of the direct expression of wanting to end life, not just general dissatisfaction. It is not 'behavior' due to the absence of any plan or method, and it is not 'attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

   - Key elements: The post mentions a desire not to wake up (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow""), which implies thoughts of death. It also includes emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair (""Tired of being alone,"" ""that'll probably get me depressed enough""). There is a reference to past attempts (""to attempt properly again""), but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" expresses a desire not to be alive.
   - Since it's not explicitly mentioning ""suicide,"" but there is a clear expression of wanting to die, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the context with ""attempt"" makes it indicative of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is indicated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire not to wake up and potential future attempt), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It does not qualify as 'Behavior' due to no planning, 'Attempt' because it's not primarily describing past actions, and 'Indicator' because there are direct expressions of wanting to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit requests for someone to kill the user, hide their body, and chop them up to ensure they are never found. There are direct mentions of death and dying through phrases like ""kill me"" and ""chop me up."" Emotional indicators include a sense of hopelessness and desperation, as the user wants to disappear forever to avoid their family. Specific plans or methods mentioned include killing, dismemberment (chopping up), and body concealment (hiding). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""kill me"" and ensuring they are never found. This qualifies as explicit expressions of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including killing (implying a violent act), chopping up (dismemberment as a means), and hiding the body (concealment to avoid discovery). This suggests a plan involving ways to end life and dispose of the body. There are signs of preparation in the form of seeking someone to carry out the act, which indicates intent to act on the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions, as the user is actively looking for someone to perform the actions. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die, along with specific methods (killing, chopping up, hiding), which constitutes a plan. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Behavior' as it involves suicidal thoughts plus explicit planning. It does not qualify as 'Ideation' due to the presence of methods, nor 'Attempt' since no past action is described, and not 'Indicator' due to the clear expressions of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post emphasizes the inability to harm themselves, with no indications of planning.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" suggests dissatisfaction with life experiences but does not explicitly express a desire to die or end one's life. Since this is unclear and not direct, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

There are no direct mentions of death or dying beyond ""reason to die,"" no explicit self-harm descriptions, and no specific plans or methods like tools or locations. Emotional indicators show significant dissatisfaction and a long-standing sickness, but the focus is on internal struggle.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""my reason to die"" and ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it,"" which imply suicidal intent. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""reason to die."" This is explicit enough to go beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions leaving a note, which is a recognized form of preparation for suicide. Since this indicates preparation, it leans toward 'behavior,' but as per rules, if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; however, the note qualifies as explicit preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., ex's actions, the sickness) and current frustrations, with ""I left a note"" suggesting a recent action rather than a fully past attempt. No past suicide attempts are explicitly described, only ongoing issues.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""reason to die"") and signs of preparation (e.g., leaving a note), which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves preparations for suicide. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the note, and there's no description of a completed past attempt, so 'attempt' doesn't fit best.

369,"All i want is to be normal. I wish I'd been born neurotypical. Had ADHD all my life. They used to say it goes away at puberty, but they were wrong. It gets worse. Much worse. It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore. What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight? I just want to be normal. How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user's struggles with ADHD, feelings of abnormality, social isolation, past bullying, loneliness, self-loathing, and explicit expressions of wanting to die. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I wanted to die,"" ""I just want to die,"" and a question about how to kill themselves without leaving a body. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, fear, and a sense of being a burden. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, though the question implies thinking about methods. No references to past attempts are present; only past thoughts of wanting to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I wanted to die,"" ""I just want to die,"" and ""How do I kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user clearly expresses a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods, tools, locations, or substances are detailed; the user asks a vague question about killing themselves without leaving a body, which suggests ideation but not a concrete plan. No signs of preparation are evident.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', which applies here as the content does not describe a specific plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., bullying in middle school, past relationships) but focuses on current feelings of wanting to die and a vague future intent in the question asked. No past attempts are described, only past thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'. There is no specific plan or preparation mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions of wanting to die, and it is not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

370,"No point in it all. I hate being trapped in limbo. I need something to really push me over the edge. I won't get anywhere in life and people are starting to lose hope in me (as they should). A lot of times I feel like I wasn't meant for this world. I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is. Everything here is lame and it just makes me sick and I don't really see a future for myself. In the end, I'm just going to keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me. One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, feeling trapped, and a sense of no purpose in life. There are mentions of emotional distress such as hating limbo, not being meant for this world, and questioning the point of moving on. Phrases like ""pushing me over the edge,"" ""one last push and I'll be free from it all and faced with the eternal void,"" and ""no point in waiting for it to come naturally"" suggest indirect references to death or dying. However, there are no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) - The post does not use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (No) - While there are indirect expressions (e.g., ""pushing me over the edge"" and ""faced with the eternal void""), they are metaphorical and not direct. Since it's unclear if suicide is explicitly mentioned, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) - No tools, locations, substances, or preparations are referenced.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) - Nothing indicates any concrete steps toward suicide.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but since there's no evidence of planning at all, this doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future hopelessness (e.g., ""I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and vague thoughts about death, but lacks explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.' There are no plans (ruling out 'behavior') or past attempts (ruling out 'attempt').

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of ""commit suicide"" and a description of emotional buildup leading to a breakdown. It discusses bottling up emotions and snapping, which are emotional indicators of distress and hopelessness in a general sense. There are no mentions of death, dying, self-harm beyond the reference to suicide, no specific plans, methods, or preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post uses the phrase ""commit suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as the post discusses suicide in a general context about ""people"" and uses ""we've"" which might imply personal identification, but it does not explicitly express the poster's own suicidal thoughts or desires. Since it's not a clear personal expression, and the rules instruct to lean toward 'indicator' when in doubt, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or method, so if it were to be considered further, it would default to 'ideation' over 'behavior' if suicidal thoughts were present, but they are not explicitly so.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a general process (e.g., ""one day we just snap""), which seems to describe a hypothetical or common experience rather than past events, current intentions, or future plans specific to the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post mentions suicide explicitly but does not express the poster's own suicidal thoughts, desires, or plans. It is a general statement about people who commit suicide, with possible personal relatability through ""we've,"" but this is not sufficient for 'ideation' as it lacks explicit expressions of the poster's desire to die. Given the rules that the risk applies only to the person writing the post and to choose 'indicator' when in doubt, this fits best as 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever,"" which reference suicide and death. Emotional indicators show anger, resentment, and hopelessness, such as ""fuck everyone I knew"" and ""I dont owe anybody shit."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post expresses a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions, as indicated by conditional and future-oriented language like ""If I kill myself"" and ""before I leave this world forever."" There are no references to past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'ideation.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as it does not describe past actions.

373,"Goddamn I am so tired of having to live. 23, never had a job in my life, and I'm about to fail college yet again. I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances. Life isn't about making something happen, it's about taking opportunities that come to you, and I feel like none have come to me except one.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme tiredness of life, failure in college, social isolation, frustration with the only friend, anxiety, depression, inability to perform daily tasks (e.g., showering, brushing teeth), hopelessness, and a lack of motivation. There are mentions of death (""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead.""), indicating a desire to not be alive. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, anxiety, and frustration. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" directly expresses a desire or expectation of not being alive. Since this is a clear indicator of suicidal thoughts, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Therefore, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., in five years), but not to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (""Dead in five years""), which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It is not 'indicator' due to the direct mention of death as a future state. It is not 'behavior' because no plan or method is described. It is not 'attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a hypothetical question about why people stop ""someone"" from killing themselves, possibly to end pain. There is a mention of suicide through the phrase ""kill their self,"" which is a misspelling of ""kill themselves."" Emotional indicators include references to ending pain, suggesting distress. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill their self."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as the post is phrased hypothetically about ""someone"" rather than the poster themselves, despite the addition of ""(Asking for a personal reason),"" which might imply a personal context but does not explicitly state the poster's own thoughts. Since it's not a direct expression from the poster, and the rules instruct to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I am considering this as not fully explicit for the poster.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, there's no indication of any planning at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a hypothetical scenario rather than past events, current feelings, or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post mentions suicide but does not explicitly express the poster's own suicidal thoughts or desires. It is framed as a general question, and while it includes emotional distress indicators, the rules emphasize that for it to be anything other than 'indicator,' the mention must be very explicit regarding the poster's own feelings. Given the doubt about whether this constitutes a direct expression, I am leaning toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

So some how she convince me not to. Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's history of suicidal thoughts since age 10 or 11, a past incident where they considered jumping into a lake to drown, current feelings of depression and daily thoughts of suicide by train, a specific plan to carry it out on their 18th birthday, and a question about the method (putting their neck on train tracks). There are mentions of death, dying, and suicide; emotional indicators like hopelessness and depression; specific plans and methods (train tracks); and references to past suicidal thoughts, though not actual attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user states they have been suicidal and currently think about suicide by train.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as jumping into a lake (past thought) and suicide by train with details on how (neck on tracks). There are signs of preparation, like planning it for their 18th birthday, which indicates intent beyond just thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (thoughts at age 10 or 11) and current/future intentions (daily thoughts and a plan for age 18). Past attempts are not specifically described, as the lake incident was just a thought, not an action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (method and timing for suicide by train), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. Although there are references to past thoughts, they do not constitute a past attempt, so the rule for labeling as 'Attempt' due to current plans does not apply here. The explicit plan makes this more than just 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions past suicidal thoughts (""I’ve had some suicidal thoughts through my life""), current thoughts triggered by someone else's attempt (""Since then I keep thinking about it"" and ""it’s now ok to try""), and emotional distress (""I just don’t want to think like this anymore""). There are references to suicide and thoughts of dying, but no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include a sense of temptation and unwanted thoughts, suggesting distress and hopelessness.
   - No explicit plans, methods, or preparations are identified.
   - There are references to past suicidal thoughts but not to past attempts by the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and implies it's ""ok to try.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""it’s now ok to try,"" which indicate a desire related to suicide, though not overwhelmingly direct.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans toward Ideation rather than Indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - Since there is no evidence of a plan, and the guidelines instruct to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this does not qualify as Behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past suicidal thoughts (""through my life, but most of them are behind me"") and current intentions (""I keep thinking about it"" and ""it’s now ok to try""), but not to any past attempts by the user. The focus is on ongoing thoughts rather than historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a vague desire related to suicide, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of Ideation, as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not Behavior due to the absence of a plan, and not Attempt since no past attempt by the user is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include descriptions of intrusive thoughts, compulsions, rage outbursts, and depressive episodes, along with the phrase ""just want my life to end."" This indicates emotional distress, hopelessness, and a desire for life to end.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There is no explicit mention of ""suicide"" or self-harm, but ""want my life to end"" implies a desire for death.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through the inability to perform daily tasks and the constant presence of negative mental states.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned, such as tools, locations, or steps toward ending life.
   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""just want my life to end"" directly expresses a desire to die.
   - Since this is a direct expression of wanting to die, it qualifies as an explicit suicidal thought, though not using the exact word ""suicide."" Given the definitions, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as it goes beyond vague dissatisfaction.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, locations, or any means of carrying out a suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps or preparations have been taken.
   - Since there is no evidence of planning, if it fits ideation, that is appropriate over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current struggles and intentions, as the language describes ongoing issues and a present desire (""just want my life to end"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""want my life to end""), which aligns with ideation as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method. It does not qualify as indicator because of the direct expression of wanting to end life, nor as behavior due to the absence of planning, or attempt since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include feelings of disassociation, dysphoria, emotional disconnection, and references to past events like ""nearly killing myself one night."" There are mentions of death and suicide-related thoughts, such as emotional numbness regarding serious topics and a potential future action. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of not being in control. Specific plans or methods mentioned: ""step off a building or over a bridge without thinking."" References to past attempts: ""nearly killing myself one night.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""nearly killing myself one night"" and the implication in the ending statement.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post expresses a desire for control through potentially ending life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""step off a building or over a bridge,"" which indicates potential methods like jumping.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as notes or acquiring means.
   - Since a method is mentioned, this leans toward planning, but I'll consider the overall context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (""nearly killing myself one night"") and current/future intentions (""it'll only take one day where I step off a building"").
   - Past attempts are specifically described, and there's a mix with current plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes a reference to a past attempt (""nearly killing myself""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans (e.g., stepping off a building), and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. This overrides other categories like 'Ideation' or 'Behavior' based on the explicit rule.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances; only a general fear that it might be painful.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since no specific plan is present, this fits ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. No description of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to take oneself out), indicating ideation. However, there is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not an indicator due to the explicit suicide reference, and it is not an attempt as no past actions are described.

380,Screw this. The more I live the more I want to die. Can't be fucked with anything anymore,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die (""the more I live the more I want to die"") and emotional indicators of frustration, hopelessness, and general dissatisfaction (""Screw this. Can't be fucked with anything anymore""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm beyond the desire to die; no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described; and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the phrase ""the more I live the more I want to die,"" which indicates a desire to not be alive. Since this is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning, so this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and ongoing emotions rather than past events or future intentions. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It is not Indicator because there is a direct indication of wanting to die, not just general distress. It is not Behavior due to the absence of a plan, and it is not Attempt as there are no references to past actions.

My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way. It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone, they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay. I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's age (16 years old), struggles with mental health due to quarantine, family conflicts (being called lazy, useless, a failure, and disappointment), dropping grades, feelings of burnout, and explicit thoughts about death. There are mentions of death and dying, such as ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" and ""I want to die."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feeling like a coward, and fear of consequences. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user states ""I have been thinking on how to die painlessly"" and ""I want to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user mentions thinking about dying painlessly but does not detail any tools, locations, substances, or preparations. There are no signs of preparation, such as acquiring means or writing a note. Since no explicit plan is described, this aligns more with ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""for the past 6+ months I have been thinking""), with no mention of past events or attempts. It focuses on present thoughts and future fears.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves thoughts of suicide without concrete planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of thinking about killing oneself, as in ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop."" There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""I hate everything,"" ""My life is ruined,"" and ""I've been shoveling shit for 30+ years."" It also references preparation with ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it,"" which implies an action but doesn't specify details. No explicit self-harm or methods are mentioned, and there's no reference to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""thought about killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through expressions of hating life and ongoing thoughts of suicide.
   - The mentions are explicit enough to go beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or detailed methods are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Possibly, with ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it,"" which could imply a suicide note, but it's not explicit or detailed. Since the instructions state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure, I lean toward not classifying this as a full plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to ongoing and past thoughts (e.g., ""thought about killing myself for 5 years""), but the reference to ""before I do it"" suggests future intentions rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill oneself), fitting 'ideation,' but lacks specific plans or methods, so it doesn't qualify as 'behavior.' It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide thoughts, and it's not 'attempt' as no past actions are detailed. Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit.

I ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of severe depression, hopelessness, and specific reasons for distress (e.g., fear of losing mother to a virus, anti-LGBT environment, job loss, and a bad trip). There are mentions of death and suicide through phrases like ""Ending it soon,"" and a clear indication of self-harm via the plan to take a large amount of dextromethorphan. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. Specific plans or methods are mentioned: ordering 14 grams of dextromethorphan and intending to take it all. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""Ending it soon"" directly implies a desire to end one's life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the phrase and the stated intention to take the substance.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies ordering and planning to ingest 14 grams of dextromethorphan, which is a substance that could be used for overdose. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ordering the substance indicates preparation. Since this involves a specific method and preparation, it goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions, as the user states they will take the substance ""as soon as it gets here."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""Ending it soon"") and a specific plan to commit suicide (ordering and intending to take a lethal amount of a substance). This aligns with the 'Behavior' category, as it involves both suicidal thoughts and explicit planning/preparation. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, 'Ideation' because of the presence of a plan, or 'Attempt' since no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and questioning the value of life, such as rhetorical questions about why people want to live and the burden of living for many years. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, as the user describes their past 15 years as ""not really good"" and expresses overwhelm at the idea of 60 more years. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post questions the importance of staying alive but does not explicitly state a desire to die. Since it is unclear and leans toward general distress, I am leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to the user's current feelings about their past and future life span but does not describe past events like attempts or indicate future intentions to act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general dissatisfaction and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator', as it involves vague expressions of distress without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""passive suicidal,"" ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal,"" and ""suicide by cop."" It discusses the risk of encouraging suicide in others but does not include emotional indicators like personal hopelessness or despair from the poster. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations by the poster, nor references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, terms like ""suicidal"" and ""suicide by cop"" are used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive from the poster? No, the post discusses suicide in a general or hypothetical context about others, not the poster's own thoughts or feelings.
   - Since the mentions are not about the poster themselves, and the rules specify that suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, this leans toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""suicide by cop"" is referenced as a method, but it is in the context of others, not the poster.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing is mentioned regarding the poster's own actions.
   - As this is not related to the poster's explicit planning, it does not qualify for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to potential future risks for others, not the poster's past, current, or future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to any attempts, past or otherwise, by the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post lacks any explicit expressions of the poster's own suicidal thoughts, desires, plans, or attempts. It is a general advisory statement about suicide risks for others. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there is no direct indication of the poster's suicide risk. When in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over other categories, and here, the content does not meet the criteria for 'ideation,' 'behavior,' or 'attempt' as it pertains to the poster.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of a potential Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis, access to insulin pens, a past incident of almost going into shock, feelings of depression and not wanting to be a burden, and explicit thoughts about using an insulin pump as a method to end their life. There are references to death and dying through the user's plan to use the pump, emotional indicators of hopelessness and depression, specific methods like the insulin pump with ""100s of units at the press of a button,"" and ideas for suicide. No clear references to past attempts are present, though they mention thinking about it without acting.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user describes choosing the insulin pump as a way to end their life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""the way I choose to go"" and having ideas for how to do it.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user specifies the insulin pump and pens as methods, with details like ease of access and units of insulin.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, they already have access to insulin pens and are anticipating a pump, which indicates some level of preparation.
   - Since specific methods are described, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., if diagnosed and getting a pump), with a mention of a past incident (almost going into shock), but no explicit past suicide attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of wanting to kill oneself (""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday? well I do""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""tired of everything,"" ""Worst birthday ever,"" and the sad emoji ☹️), and a vague reference to having an opportunity (""I have a chance right now"").

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of stress, mental health struggles, academic pressures, isolation, and hopelessness. There are mentions of death and dying in phrases like ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit,"" and an explicit mention of suicide in ""I'm finally considering suicide."" Emotional indicators include despair, confusion about the future, and feelings of worthlessness. There are no references to specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor any mentions of past attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post states ""I'm finally considering suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I don't want to do this anymore"" and ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit,"" which indicate a desire to not continue living.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is indicated.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, this fits 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and recent feelings, such as ""considering suicide"" now, rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts, only that the user hadn't thought about it before.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., considering suicide and questioning the point of living), but lacks any specific plan or method, so it best fits 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit descriptions of attempting to end life, self-harm (bleeding from wrists and thighs), emotional distress (shaking, bawling, suspense, hopelessness), and references to a knife as a tool. There are mentions of death, dying, and suicide, along with feelings of readiness to commit but stopping short. Emotional indicators show deep despair and helplessness.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I just attempted to end my life,"" ""almost committed,"" ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I was ready to leave everything"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., knife for self-harm, cutting wrists and thighs).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (implied by having the knife and being on the verge of using it).
   - Since a method is explicitly mentioned with actual harm, this indicates more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to a very recent past event (""I just attempted""), describing a concrete action that occurred, rather than current or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post describes a past attempt with concrete actions (self-harm leading to bleeding), fitting the 'Attempt' category, as it involves a historic action rather than just thoughts or plans. It explicitly states an attempt occurred, aligning with the definition requiring a concrete past action.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die, such as ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would,"" and ""feel like killing myself."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, like ""I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live"" and ""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. No references to past attempts are made; instead, the user states they've never attempted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""wanting to.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""despite wanting to"" and ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and past family events, but the suicidal thoughts are expressed as ongoing desires without future intentions or past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' due to no past actions.

Kinda sad I never got to do anything. Not that I could've anyways.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of ending life, suicide, and self-harm. The user states ""ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape,"" and describes a specific method (""slit my wrists with some scissors""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness about school, failure, and family issues, such as feeling like a failure and viewing parents as ""pure evil."" There are signs of preparation, like having written a suicide note and planning to delete everything. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I'll stop being a coward finally,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""slit my wrists with some scissors"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., ""written my suicide note and put it on my notes app,"" ""delete everything"").
   - This clearly indicates explicit planning, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""ending my life tonight,"" ""when everyone is going to bed""). No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts along with a specific plan (method and preparations), which fits the definition of 'Behavior.' It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions and planning. It is not 'Ideation' because a plan is detailed. It is not 'Attempt' as this is about current intentions, not past actions.

392,"""friend"" snitched on me and told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me. this is like preventing someone to get euthanized. what the fuck.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of ""my plan to kill myself,"" which directly references suicide. There are emotional indicators of frustration and anger, as seen in phrases like ""what the fuck"" and the comparison to preventing euthanasia, suggesting distress and possibly hopelessness. No specific methods, preparations, or tools are described. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post states ""my plan to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied through the mention of the plan.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No, only a general reference to a ""plan"" is made, without any explicit details. Since it's not specific, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a current or recent situation (the plan being revealed and family watching), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts via ""my plan to kill myself,"" which indicates ideation. However, it lacks specific details about methods or preparations, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, and it is not 'attempt' as no past actions are described. Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a plan to withdraw from social interactions for 3 weeks, explicit mention of suicide (""im gonna kill myself""), a specific timeline (""3 weeks from now""), and expressions of concern for others (""I hope my baby ends up safe""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, such as isolating from people except children. No mentions of self-harm methods, tools, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""im gonna kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it directly states an intention to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, substances, or locations are detailed. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post describes withdrawing from interactions for 3 weeks as a lead-up to the act, and specifies a timeline (""3 weeks from now""), which indicates preparation. Since there is evidence of planning through the timeline and isolation, this leans toward 'behavior,' but as per rules, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.' However, the timeline qualifies as explicit preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""3 weeks from now""), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post has explicit suicide mentions and a timeline with preparation (withdrawal), which fits 'behavior' as it includes explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the specified actions and timeline.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a question about lethality (""Would this kill me"") and a list of specific substances with quantities (Midol 3 bottles, Prozac 30 20mg pills, Tylenol bottle, and a water bottle full of alcohol). This suggests an inquiry into the potential fatal effects of these items. There are mentions related to death (implied by ""kill me""), but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, or emotional indicators like hopelessness. No specific plans beyond the list of substances are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, but the question ""Would this kill me?"" implies consideration of death. Since this is not a direct or explicit mention of suicide, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context suggests more than general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, as the post lists substances (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, alcohol) with quantities, which could be means for overdose. This indicates signs of preparation or at least specific ideas about how to cause death. If uncertain about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but the detailed list qualifies as mentioning methods.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This appears to refer to current or future intentions, as it's phrased as a hypothetical question about the effects. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post does not explicitly mention suicide, so it could lean toward 'indicator'. However, it includes explicit thoughts about death and specific methods (substances with quantities), which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves planning. Based on the definitions, this fits 'behavior' because of the mention of specific means, even without direct suicidal language.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include direct mentions of suicide, such as ""suicide,"" ""end it,"" and planning to make it look like a car accident. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and concern for loved ones' mental health. There are specific plans mentioned, like staging a car accident, but no references to self-harm tools, substances, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""end it"" and ""I'll get what I want"" indicate a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post refers to a method like staging a car accident.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is mention of planning and thinking about the method, which implies some level of preparation, though not detailed (e.g., no mention of acquiring a car or writing a note). Since a specific method is described, this qualifies as planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""planning to end it"" and ""recently I've been thinking of doing it."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and mentions a specific plan (e.g., car accident as a method), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a method, so 'Behavior' is the best fit. If there were no specific method, it might be 'Ideation,' but the plan pushes it to 'Behavior.'

Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in.

Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, feeling like a ""lost cause,"" constant failure in life aspects (e.g., jobs, driving lessons), and being a burden on family. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show despair and resentment, but nothing specific to suicidal intent. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted. References to ""attempts"" appear to mean efforts to improve life (e.g., job applications), not suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses life failures and hopelessness but does not express a desire to end life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to any suicide-related plans or means, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but it's not applicable here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., failed job applications, driving lessons) and current feelings of failure, but there are no indications of current or future suicidal intentions. No past suicide attempts are specifically described; the ""attempts"" mentioned are about life improvements.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings expressed. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses sadness and a need for connection but does not indicate any desire to end one's life. Since there are no explicit mentions, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of.

I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions writing a note, which could imply preparation for suicide. There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""light at the end of the tunnel has disappeared,"" ""feel like a completely worthless person,"" ""at the end of my rope,"" ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going,"" and references to fear of non-existence after death. It also describes a recent event involving the ER and transport to another hospital, which may indicate a past attempt. No specific methods, tools, or locations for suicide are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I just can't continue"" and ""fear of non-existence after death doesn't seem to deter me anymore,"" indicating a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, substances, or locations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I wrote a note today"" could be a sign of preparation, such as a suicide note. However, since it's not explicitly linked to a plan, it's uncertain, so I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if not clear.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to both past events (e.g., the ER visit last night, which seems to be a concrete action like a potential suicide attempt) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I can't keep going like this""). The ER visit describes a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die), but the key factor is the description of a past ER visit, which likely qualifies as a past suicide attempt (e.g., overdose or self-harm event). According to the definitions, this fits 'Attempt' because it describes a historic action. Even though there are current ideation elements, the presence of a past attempt takes precedence.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to attempting to end one's life and the failure of those attempts. Specifically, phrases like ""Tried didn't work"" and ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work"" indicate mentions of death and suicide. Emotional indicators include implied despair from repeated failures. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and it references past attempts without details.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""end my life"" directly refers to suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the description of attempts. This is clear and not vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no explicit plan is present, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past events, as it describes attempts that ""didn't work"" and were tried ""again,"" indicating historical actions rather than current or future intentions. Past attempts are specifically implied.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes past attempts at suicide, fitting the 'Attempt' category, which focuses on historic actions. There are no current plans mentioned, so it's not 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide references.

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a detailed description of the user's health issues following a fall, such as concussion symptoms, fogginess, hot water sensation in the head, inflammation, and various treatments attempted. Emotional indicators include feelings of hopelessness and frustration, as the user states, ""I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are noted, and there are no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general distress and hopelessness related to health symptoms, but nothing directly indicates suicidal thoughts. Since it's unclear or absent, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning related to suicide. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's no evidence of either.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events (the fall 7 months ago) and current ongoing symptoms, with no indication of future intentions related to suicide. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness about health issues but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it involves dissatisfaction and emotional struggle without direct suicidal references. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include repeated mentions of death and dying, such as ""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" and ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot."" Emotional indicators show extreme hopelessness, self-loathing, despair, and feelings of being a burden. There are no references to past attempts or self-harm behaviors, but specific methods are implied (e.g., bullet for a gun, slitting throat for a knife). The post expresses frustration and a desire for death without indicating actual preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through direct expressions like desiring a bullet in the head or throat being slit.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I deserve to die"" and ""I want someone to stomp me out.""
   - The language is clear and explicit, so this is not leaning toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, such as ""a fucking bullet in my head"" (implying a gun) and ""slit my fucking throat"" (implying a knife). These are specific means for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post states ""I have no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway,"" indicating no active preparations. However, the mention of specific methods aligns with the definition of 'behavior' as it involves explicit ideas of how to commit suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and desires, with no mention of past events or attempts. It's focused on the present state of mind.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions specific methods (e.g., gun, knife), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts along with references to means, even without confirmed plans or preparations. Although the user denies having plans, the explicit mention of methods overrides and categorizes it as 'behavior' per the definitions.

   - Key elements in the post include expressions of loneliness, obligation to live, fear of burdening parents, self-loathing (e.g., ""hideous fucking mutant""), loss of romantic love, and ongoing emptiness. There are mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""I will die alone"" and ""the second they're gone, so am I""), which suggest vague feelings about dying. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and sadness. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not use words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct terms.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrases ""I will die alone"" and ""so am I"" imply a desire not to continue living, but they are indirect and tied to emotional distress rather than explicit suicidal intent.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and possible future outcomes (e.g., after parents are gone), but it does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and vague references to dying, but without explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to end one's life. According to the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because suicide is not very explicitly mentioned. When in doubt, the rules specify choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

403,"don't know what to do but I'm here for now. got bad urges tonight. not even just suicidal ones, self destructive ones in general as well. they've been happening again for a while now, since I dropped out of college. I'm talking to some friends now. not about them or anything, just random stuff. it's helping, but I'm just lying here wondering if I should tell them. every conversation I have with them these days, I'm just thinking ""this might be our last conversation"". during our dnd sessions, I'm thinking it could be my last. then I read this post on tumblr about the aftermath of suicide on people left behind and I started crying. and there's four friends in particular I'd be worried about and I can't help but think about them and hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling. and now it's just a guilty downward spiral but I can't do much about it right now, and I don't want to worry any of my friends by telling them how bad it is, like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad. I don't know what I want anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""bad urges tonight,"" including ""suicidal ones"" and ""self-destructive ones."" It discusses these urges recurring since dropping out of college, thoughts of last conversations, reading about suicide's aftermath and crying, guilt about impacting friends and sibling, and a vague reference to having ""a plan but no date set."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, guilt, and a downward spiral. There are explicit mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts, but no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are detailed. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicidal ones,"" ""thinking of killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., thoughts that conversations might be the last, and having a plan).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, substances, or methods are described; only a vague ""I have a plan but no date set.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs like acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since the plan is not detailed and the instructions specify to choose 'ideation' if uncertain, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., urges happening now), with future implications (e.g., a plan without a date), but no past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, fitting 'Ideation' as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, 'Behavior' due to lack of detailed planning (and uncertainty leans to 'Ideation'), or 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

I find therapy tough enough as it is, and if lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff, then that's great. Well it's great till it starts to happen more and more frequently. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include references to suicidal thoughts in the context of questionnaires, the user's reluctance to discuss them due to stress, lying about them to avoid further probing, and expressions of emotional distress such as finding therapy tough and uncertainty about overcoming a ""grave"" they dug. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like not being strong enough to get out of the situation. No mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post directly references ""suicidal thoughts"" that the user has and lies about.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the implication of having suicidal thoughts and the metaphorical ""grave,"" but it's tied to explicit mention of suicidal thoughts.
   - Since it's explicit, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no plan is evident, this would not qualify as 'behavior'; instead, it fits 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and experiences (e.g., lying about thoughts now and ongoing therapy struggles), with a hint of future concerns (e.g., thoughts happening more frequently). No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., admitting to having them and lying about them), which aligns with 'ideation' as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned. It goes beyond general distress but does not involve planning or past actions, so 'ideation' is the best fit.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a reference to ""nearly killing myself/shooting up the school,"" which suggests a past near-attempt at suicide or self-harm. Emotional indicators include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""feeling like I'm just rotting away,"" ""I fucking hate living,"" and frustration with bullies. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for the future, and no clear references to completed past attempts beyond the ""nearly"" phrase.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""nearly killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I fucking hate living."" Since these are explicit, it leans away from 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ""shooting up the school,"" which implies a method (e.g., using a gun). However, this is in the context of a past event (""nearly""), not current preparation. Since there's no indication of current plans or preparations, and instructions advise choosing 'ideation' if uncertain about explicit planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events (""bullied me into nearly killing myself"") and current feelings (""I hate living""), with no explicit future intentions. The ""nearly killing myself"" phrase describes a past near-action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions a past near-attempt at suicide (""nearly killing myself""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it describes a historic action that was close to occurring. Although it's not a confirmed completed attempt, the phrasing suggests a concrete past event rather than just thoughts. There are no current plans, so it doesn't fit 'Behavior,' and the explicit mentions go beyond 'Indicator' or 'Ideation.'

Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post describes a past overdose (OD) attempt involving swallowing 120+ pills of ibuprofen and drinking hard liquor. It mentions emotional distress, such as feeling stupid, not recognizing the potential lethality, and ongoing processing of the event. There are references to death and dying through the OD description, emotional indicators of regret and confusion, and a clear mention of wanting to die (""I wanted to""). Specific methods are detailed (ibuprofen pills and liquor), and there's a reference to delaying hospital visit, indicating past preparation and action.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, through the OD and the phrase ""I wanted to"" (implying a desire to die).
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident in the user's reflection on the event and feelings of stupidity.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, the post details the method (pills and liquor) and actions taken (swallowing pills, drinking, delaying hospital).
   - References to past attempts: Yes, the entire post centers on a survived OD.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of the OD and the statement ""I wanted to,"" which implies a desire to end life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, inferred from the OD attempt and explicit wording.
   - The content is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ibuprofen pills and hard liquor as means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, swallowing pills and drinking, along with delaying hospital.
   - This is about a past event, so it aligns with completed behavior rather than current ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily past events (the OD has already occurred), with current reflection but no mention of future plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the OD is detailed as a concrete past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (OD), which fits the 'Attempt' category as it involves a concrete historical action. There are no current plans mentioned, so it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior'. It's not just ideation since an actual attempt occurred, and it's not 'Indicator' due to explicit references to the attempt and desire to die.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like wanting to ""get away from it all"" and the explicit reference to suicide.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this moves beyond 'indicator.'

It slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away. I wonder if a long-term cure even exists.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include discussions of depression, the difficulty in continuing daily life, feelings of isolation, and the persistent nature of depression. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""it makes it hard to keep going,"" ""every day feels like the previous one,"" and ""it slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; while there is an implication of struggle in phrases like ""hard to keep going,"" it does not directly express a desire to die. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing feelings about depression, with no indication of past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as believing it's inevitable and not following through on seeing a doctor. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to the user's past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states ""I get suicidal thoughts."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""it just makes it seem like it's inevitable for me"" and the admission of suicidal thoughts. This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. The user expresses suicidal thoughts but dismisses acting on them by saying ""im probably too much of a pussy to ever do it.""

I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

There are references to death and dying through the user's suicidal thoughts and the idea of ending it together with another person. Emotional indicators include despair, numbness, and feeling lost. Specific plans or methods are not detailed for the user, though self-harm is described as a coping mechanism.

   - Are there signs of preparation? None evident for the user.
   - Since there's no explicit plan with methods, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior, per the rule to choose 'ideation' if uncertain.

   - This refers to past events (e.g., long-term self-harm, military discharge) and current/future intentions (e.g., contemplating suicide now and the conditional plan to end it together). No past suicide attempts are described for the user, only self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (contemplating suicide and wanting to end life), but lacks specific plans or methods, so it fits 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include quotes from the user's parents that are abusive and dismissive, with direct mentions of suicide, self-harm, and past attempts. Specific references include ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" and ""vomit your food again"" (implying purging or self-harm). Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, and belittlement. There are references to past attempts of suicide and self-harm, but no explicit details of current plans or preparations from the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself,"" and ""try to kill yourself again.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the parents' quotes and references to the user's past actions, indicating the user's history.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, methods like using a gun or cutting wrists are referenced in the parents' quotes.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No direct signs from the user, but the mentions are tied to past events rather than current planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to past events, such as previous suicide attempts (e.g., ""Did you try to kill yourself again?""), rather than current or future intentions. The user's sharing of these quotes highlights historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes past suicide attempts by the user, as indicated by phrases like ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" This aligns with the 'Attempt' category, which focuses on historic actions. There are no explicit current plans, so it doesn't fit 'Behavior' or 'Ideation' as the primary focus.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct question about ways to kill oneself, specifically the least painful method, which mentions death and suicide explicitly. There are emotional indicators of desperation and hopelessness, as the user dismisses advice about living and insists on a straight answer. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described in detail; the user is inquiring about methods rather than stating them. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post uses the phrase ""kill yourself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the inquiry about suicide methods. Since it is clear, no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post asks for methods but does not specify any particular ones (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances are named). Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no explicit plan or specific idea mentioned, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this fits ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is seeking information now for potential future action. No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'ideation,' as it involves expressions of wanting to end one's life without detailing a plan. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a specific plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are referenced.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of writing a ""suicidal note,"" which directly relates to suicide. There are emotional indicators of severe internal pain, as the user describes their stomach convulsing from pain inside, suggesting distress and hopelessness. No specific plans, methods, or preparations beyond the note are mentioned. There is a reference to ""again,"" which might imply past behavior, but it doesn't describe any past attempts in detail.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""suicidal note."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Not directly, but the context implies suicidal intent. Since it's explicit about the note, this leans away from 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, mentioning writing a suicidal note again indicates preparation, as per the category definitions. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but the reference to a suicide note qualifies as explicit preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (""I think I'm going to write""), not past events. The word ""again"" hints at past actions, but it doesn't describe a concrete past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal expressions and mentions preparation (suicidal note), which fits the 'Behavior' category as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere thoughts (as in 'Ideation') and doesn't describe a past attempt (as in 'Attempt'). Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

""Slaying myself"" appears to be a reference to killing oneself, which relates to suicide or self-harm. There are no clear emotional indicators like hopelessness, but the language suggests distress. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""slaying myself"" implies a desire to end one's own life, though it's not using standard terminology like ""suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the phrase ""slaying myself."" Since this is an expression of suicidal thoughts, even if not perfectly explicit, it leans toward being recognized as such.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plan is evident, this should be classified as 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""I will end up""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""slaying myself""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'ideation'. It is not 'indicator' because there is an explicit mention of self-harm, nor 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as it doesn't describe past actions.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut).

No, as the user says, ""I don't want to die— I want to live,"" but they acknowledge having suicidal thoughts due to shame.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no details about plans, methods, or preparations, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and past events like failing classes, but the suicidal ideation is described in the present context without indicating past attempts or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation,"" which aligns with expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan, fitting the 'Ideation' category.

   - Key elements: The post mentions thoughts of dying or not living if the user fails a test, such as ""decide whether or not I'll live till October"" and ""I really cannot live if I fail."" It includes references to self-harm methods like ""blades I used to cut,"" ""no access to my meds,"" and ""no place to jump from."" Emotional indicators include mixed feelings: hopelessness if failing (e.g., ""cannot live if I fail""), but also current positivity like ""for the first time I don't wanna die"" and enjoyment of life activities. There are no clear signs of current preparations, but past self-harm is implied. No explicit references to past suicide attempts, only past cutting.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""don't wanna die,"" ""cannot live if I fail,"" and references to methods (meds, jumping, blades), indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, e.g., ""I don't wanna die"" and ""cannot live if I fail."" This is not vague but leans toward explicit, so it's beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, methods like meds (possibly for overdose), jumping from a place, and blades for cutting are referenced, but in the context of not having access now (e.g., ""no access to my meds""). There are no signs of current preparation or active planning; it's more reflective of past or hypothetical means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.' Since the methods are mentioned without current intent or steps, this does not qualify as a specific plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings (e.g., not wanting to die now but fearing the future) and past actions (e.g., ""blades I used to cut""). It does not describe a completed past suicide attempt but implies past self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire not to live if failing), but no evidence of a current specific plan or preparations, making it Ideation. It goes beyond Indicator due to direct mentions of dying and methods, but lacks the explicit planning required for Behavior. No concrete past attempt is described, so Attempt does not apply.

428,"I feel as if all I've done through school and my other trials all just go to support the things I hate and that we're only seen as special if people need or want something from us. School and work have drained me the fuck out of all my motivation in the things I love. And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time. I believe we're stuck in a system and forced to be milked out of work labor until we're exhausted and thrown out. This neverending process only helps the things I hate the most, and I don't know what to do anymore with my life.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and exhaustion from school, work, and family comparisons, leading to a sense of hopelessness and lack of motivation. There are mentions of feeling drained, the uselessness of efforts, and being stuck in a system that exploits people. Emotional indicators include despair, dissatisfaction, and a loss of will to strive. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there is a vague statement about not knowing what to do with life, which implies general distress but not a clear desire to end one's life. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past experiences (like school and work draining the person) and current feelings of hopelessness, but there are no references to past attempts or future intentions regarding suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, death, or a desire to die. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks explicit suicidal content. Even with strong dissatisfaction, the absence of direct suicide references means it fits 'Indicator' rather than 'Ideation' or higher categories.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of death, dying, and suicide (e.g., ""kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out,"" ""shoot myself with a gun,"" ""start cutting myself""). There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, depression, fear, and regret (e.g., ""My existence has been nothing but depression, fear, regret and worthlessness,"" ""I'm such a fucking dumbass,"" ""I fucking hate myself""). Specific plans or methods are mentioned, such as slitting wrists, using a gun, and cutting to ease pain. There are no references to past attempts; the content focuses on current feelings and future intentions.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""Why couldn't I have been aborted,"" ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die,"" ""Its a net gain for the world if i die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., slitting wrists, shooting with a gun, cutting). These are clear references to tools or means for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are indications of intent tied to future circumstances (e.g., ""Once I get a place... I'll finally be able to do what I want to do""), but no explicit details like acquiring means or writing a note. However, the mention of specific methods qualifies as planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post primarily refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I'll finally be able to do,"" ""I'm just waiting for the end""). There are no descriptions of past attempts; it's all oriented toward the present and future.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post goes beyond general distress or vague thoughts (which would be 'indicator'). It includes explicit expressions of suicidal desires and specific methods for suicide, fitting the 'behavior' category, as it mentions plans like slitting wrists or using a gun. This aligns with the definition of 'behavior' rather than 'ideation,' which lacks specific plans. There are no past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress, such as feelings of abandonment, paranoia, unlovability, and hopelessness about relationships and life. There are mentions of personal struggles like abandonment issues, PTSD from a breakup, and self-doubt, but no references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair and a desire for love, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general emotional pain and hopelessness, but without any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to end one's life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it involves dissatisfaction with life without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include multiple mentions of death, dying, and suicide (e.g., ""Death is a mercy I do not deserve,"" ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""contemplating suicide,"" ""ideating""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, and guilt (e.g., ""I hate myself,"" ""I'm not worth their time,"" ""I've done everything but nothing works""). Specific plans and methods are detailed, such as calculating isopropyl alcohol dosage for poisoning, testing attachment points for a noose, and planning to jump in front of a car. References to past thoughts exist (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts for years""), but no explicit past attempts are described.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""contemplating suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I want to die because I hate myself,"" ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., ingesting isopropyl alcohol, using a noose, jumping in front of a car).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., calculating dosages, testing attachment points, determining timings to avoid detection).
   - Since explicit planning is evident, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., thoughts for years, recent diagnosis, mom's death) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and includes specific plans and preparations (e.g., methods and testing), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not just 'Ideation' because of the detailed plans, and not 'Attempt' as no past concrete actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""the day I chose is very soon,"" which implies a planned action likely related to suicide. There are references to wanting to kill oneself, as in ""i shouldn't kill myself"" and ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" where ""this"" seems to refer to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living""), regret about family interactions, and a desire to avoid being talked down. No specific methods, tools, or self-harm are mentioned. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""i shouldn't kill myself"" and the context of ""wanted to do this for over a decade.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through expressions of life not being worth living and implying a desire to end it.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""the day I chose is very soon"" suggests some vague intent or planning, but it's not explicit or detailed enough to constitute preparation like writing a note or acquiring means. Since it's uncertain, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""the day I chose is very soon"" and long-term desires), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as there are no details of preparations or means, making it not 'Behavior.' It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include feelings of pain for over 5 years, not being able to bother anymore, being the most suicidal in a couple of months, wanting to be out of misery, and deciding not to contact anyone known for a while.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""most suicidal I've been""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I just want to be out of my misery"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? There is mention of not contacting anyone, which could suggest isolation, but it's not a clear preparation like acquiring tools or writing a note. Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and recent feelings (e.g., ""most suicidal I've been in a couple months""), with a future intention of isolation, but no description of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to be out of misery and stating it's the most suicidal period), but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits 'Ideation' as defined, since there are desires to end the suffering without detailing how. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, or substances) are detailed; the user only vaguely states ""I can't find a suitable way to go,"" which implies a search for a method but does not specify one.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of any preparations like acquiring means or writing a note.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.'

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of being at a ""low point,"" poor grammar, a need for advice, zero social skills, low self-esteem, loneliness, and concerns about moving to another country for better living. The user is worried about developing a second language and questions if it's worth the move. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.

There are mentions of death (""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP""), but these are directed at someone else, not the poster. There are no emotional indicators of the poster's own hopelessness or despair related to suicide. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts by the poster are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the post refers to the death of another person, not the poster. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?

Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses anger and intent to harm another person (a bully), with mentions of ""killing"" her. It incorrectly references ""suicide"" in the context of harming others, possibly alluding to murder-suicide, but the focus is on killing the bully, not the user themselves. Emotional indicators include frustration, jealousy from the bully, and a desire for peace. There are no mentions of death or dying related to the user, no references to self-harm, suicide, or past attempts. The user asks for suggestions on how to murder the bully, indicating intent to harm others.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in a misguided way (""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others""), which does not refer to the user's own suicide. It seems to describe harming others.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user expresses a desire to kill the bully to live in peace, not to end their own life.
   - Since the mentions are not about the user's suicide and are unclear or misused, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for suicide are mentioned; the user seeks suggestions for murdering the bully, which is about harming others, not themselves.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation for suicide; any potential preparation discussed is for harming another person.
   - Since this is not about suicide planning, it doesn't qualify for 'behavior', and if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but it's not applicable here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to ongoing bullying and future intentions to kill the bully, with mentions of past efforts to stop the bullying, but nothing related to the user's suicide.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past suicide attempts are described; only non-suicidal efforts to address the bullying.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or plans for self-harm, focusing instead on harming another person. According to the rules, suicide risk must pertain to the person writing the post, not others. This fits 'Indicator' as there are general expressions of distress (frustration and dissatisfaction), but no direct mention of the user's suicide. When in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, 'Indicator' is chosen.

   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I'm on the verge of suicide,"" indicating direct reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""I seriously cannot do this anymore,"" ""My mental health really bad,"" ""the stress of college is making,"" ""I'm such a disappointment and failure,"" and ""I just want to end it all."" There is a phrase ""I know exactly what to do,"" which suggests a possible plan, but no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are detailed. No references to past attempts are present.

   - Are there signs of preparation? None mentioned.
   - Since it's unclear if this constitutes an explicit plan, I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by phrases like ""I'm on the verge"" and ""I just want to end it all."" No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to end it all), but lacks specific details of a plan or method. This fits 'ideation,' as it involves desires to die without explicit planning. It does not qualify as 'behavior' due to the lack of specificity, and there's no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable. It's not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct expressions of wanting to die (""Someone kill me dude"" and ""I just wanna die you know""). There are mentions of death and dying, indicating emotional distress and despair. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I just wanna die""). Since these are clear indicators of suicidal thoughts, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but here it's sufficiently explicit for consideration in ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since there's no explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or immediate feelings (e.g., ""I just wanna die""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to the direct expressions of wanting to die, 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, or 'Attempt' as there's no reference to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of distress related to gender dysphoria, attraction to males, past trauma (e.g., molested at 5 years old, raised by women and doing ""girl things""), unhappiness, depression, rejection, loneliness, and a plea to God for change to become ""normal"" and free from these feelings. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, tiredness of being unhappy, depression, and feelings of being lost and alone. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire to be ""normal"" and free from negative thoughts and feelings, but it does not include any direct statements about wanting to end one's life.
   - Since there is no explicit mention, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any planning or acquisition of means.
   - As there is no evidence of planning, and uncertainty would lead to choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clearly absent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., being molested at 5 years old and an unhappy life) and current feelings of distress, but there are no references to current or future intentions related to suicide. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, or desires to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there is no direct indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings, and when in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'. There are no elements of planning or behavior, so 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt' do not apply.

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a question about whether anyone is suicidal due to knee pain, descriptions of chronic knee pain from a mild ACL sprain that has persisted for 8 months without improvement despite efforts like stretching. There is a mention of ""suicidal"" in the form of a question, indicating possible emotional distress or hopelessness related to the pain, but no direct references to death, dying, suicide plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used, but it is in a question directed at others (""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?""), not as a direct expression of the poster's own thoughts or desires. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the poster does not express personal suicidal thoughts; they are inquiring about others. Since this is not a clear, explicit mention of the poster's own feelings, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plan, method, or preparation related to suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a current ongoing issue (8 months of pain), but it does not describe past events, past attempts, or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes a vague reference to suicide in a question, but lacks any explicit expression of the poster's own suicidal thoughts or feelings. It primarily expresses distress and hopelessness about knee pain, which aligns with 'Indicator' as defined. There is no desire to die explicitly stated, no plan, and no mention of past attempts, so 'Indicator' is the best fit. When in doubt, I choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

My substance abuse is rooted in the need to be loved. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm married and I feel alone in my own head. I wish my partner would care about me the way I do about them. I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need. The damage that caused me has been irreparable. Fuck polyamory and open relationships too. I hate now this is normalized now. Not only do I feel distant from my friends, family and everything else around me but also my lover who's supposed to guide me through this pain and make me feel right. After covid, all the other shite that's happened this year too. I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over. I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death and not feel so guilty. Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again. The only person who truly understands the pain I'm feeling",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair, such as ""This year has absolutely destroyed me mentally,"" ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose,"" and ""I'm over life."" There are mentions of death, specifically ""giving in to the nothingness that is death"" and a reference to someone else who took their own life, which provides comfort. Emotional indicators include feelings of abandonment, loneliness, and substance abuse linked to the need for love. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to the poster's past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, such as ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" and ""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death."" These indicate a desire for death, so this leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts rather than vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations (e.g., no mention of a suicide note or acquiring means). The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" might suggest something ending after an action, but it does not specify a method or plan for suicide. Since there's no clear plan, this would not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post primarily refers to current feelings and future intentions, such as looking forward to death. It mentions past events like feeling abandoned and the impact of COVID, but these are not tied to past suicide attempts by the poster. The reference to someone else taking their own life is in the past, but it pertains to another person, not the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to give in to death) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction (which would be Indicator) due to phrases indicating a desire to die. There are no elements of planning or past attempts, so Behavior or Attempt do not apply. If there's any doubt about explicitness, the rules lean toward Indicator, but here it's sufficiently explicit for Ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of anger and belittlement towards the mother, a desire to cause her pain, and a direct statement ""I want to die so she can feel pain and hurt.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""I want to die."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are mentioned. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it"" is vague and does not indicate any explicit plan.

Specifically, it includes references to death and dying through phrases like ""starving myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""access to a gun,"" and ""I'll at least be dead by the end of the week."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a desire for death. There are specific methods mentioned (starving, hanging, gun) and signs of ongoing behavior (already started starving). No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through direct references to methods like hanging and using a gun, and expressions of wanting to die faster.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I just want my death to come faster"" and preferring quicker methods.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, including starving, hanging, and a gun.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user has started starving themselves, which is an ongoing action, and they express preferences for other methods, indicating consideration of plans.
   - Since specific methods and preparations are described, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and ongoing behavior (e.g., starving themselves now), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and specific plans/methods (e.g., starving, which is already in progress), fitting the 'Behavior' category. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not just 'Ideation' because of the plans, and not 'Attempt' as it's not about past actions.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, despair, and emotional distress, such as ""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""My life has already been over for six years now,"" and descriptions of anger, grief, and numbness. There are explicit mentions of suicide, including ""I plan my suicide every single day,"" and specific methods like ""using a pistol or an escape bag"" and ""douse myself in gasoline and light up."" Emotional indicators include feelings of worthlessness, isolation, and a desire for escape. There are no references to past attempts or self-harm beyond the planning.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I plan my suicide every single day."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I just don't want to go on anymore"" and the overall desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including a pistol, an escape bag, and dousing in gasoline. Signs of preparation are implied through daily planning and references to these methods, indicating more than just thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers primarily to current and ongoing feelings and intentions, with no description of past attempts; it's focused on present planning for future actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific plans/methods (e.g., pistol, gasoline), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of methods, and there are no past attempts, so it's not 'attempt.' It's not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include multiple mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as standing on a chair with a rope around the neck, past attempts like cutting wrists, laying on a road to be hit by a car, and jumping in front of a train. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feelings of isolation, nightmares, and trauma from abuse. Specific plans or methods are referenced, such as the rope and chair for hanging, and thoughts of doing it after dinner. There are clear references to past attempts at various ages.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with words like ""suicidale"" and descriptions of wanting to die or end life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I would wanna go to the angels"" and ""I can't go on like this.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, including a rope and chair for hanging, cutting wrists, and jumping in front of a train. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the recent action of standing on a chair with a rope. Since this involves explicit preparation, it goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., attempts at ages 4, 11, 19, and 24) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I just stood on a chair..."" and ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes multiple past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans and preparations, and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. This fits better than 'Behavior' because of the explicit past actions described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""die at 50 or earlier""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""it's not worth pushing my life further,"" ""the future is really grim""). No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, though stopping doctor visits could imply passive self-neglect. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post starts with ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"" and includes ""end it,"" which is a common euphemism for suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through phrases like accepting death without intervention, indicating a desire not to prolong life. Since this is somewhat explicit, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? The user mentions stopping doctor visits, which might suggest passive behavior, but it's not explicit preparation like acquiring tools or writing a note. Since there's no clear plan, this leans toward ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., accepting potential early death), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., questioning if not seeking help is suicidal and expressing acceptance of death), indicating a desire not to be alive longer, but without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' best, as there are no plans mentioned, and the expressions are explicit enough to go beyond 'Indicator'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of self-hatred, depression, feelings of inadequacy (e.g., being a coward, too depressed for friends, too ugly for a relationship), and a vague reference to self-harm (e.g., ""starve myself or something""). There is an explicit mention of suicide in the phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned with the phrase ""kill myself,"" which directly references wanting to end one's life. There are also indirect expressions of not wanting to live through the overall tone of self-loathing.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are mentioned. The reference to ""starve myself or something"" is vague and does not constitute a clear plan, so I will classify this as ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and thoughts, with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself""), indicating a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include advice on helping a friend who is struggling with thoughts of suicide, such as suggesting professional help, hugs, and emotional support. There are mentions of suicide in the context of the friend, but not from the poster's perspective. No emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair are present for the poster. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts by the poster.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in relation to a friend, not the poster. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, from the poster's viewpoint. According to the rules, the suicide risk pertains only to the person writing the post, so mentions of others do not count.

I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include emotional distress from a breakup, feelings of isolation, past abuse, stopping medication, heavy drinking, and expressions of hopelessness. 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There are references to ""no reason to live,"" ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""drive me further to killing myself,"" and ""it's time to die."" These indicate suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling like a waste of life, and isolation are prominent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) are mentioned. There is mention of stopping medication and taking the last Ativan, as well as drinking heavily, but these are not explicitly linked to a suicide plan.
   - References to past attempts: None are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicide is their life's purpose"" and ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""no reason to live"" and ""it's time to die"").
   - The mentions are explicit, so this goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances for suicide are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are behaviors like stopping medication and drinking, but these do not constitute explicit preparations for suicide (e.g., no mention of acquiring means or writing a note). Since it's uncertain, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., becoming content with suicide), with some references to past events like the breakup and abuse, but no past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die), but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

451,"Is drowning yourself painful?. As the title says. I think its the best option for me, its basically a guaranteed death is it not? Sounds rather peaceful actually, slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean as you see a light at the end of the tunnel. A nice smooth transition to death. If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses drowning as a method of suicide, describing it as a ""guaranteed death"" and ""peaceful."" It includes the user's personal consideration (""I think it's the best option for me"") and a conditional plan (""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that""). There are mentions of death and dying, emotional indicators of hopelessness (romanticizing death as peaceful), and a specific method (drowning in the ocean). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post directly refers to ""drowning yourself"" and expresses it as an option for the user.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user indicates it's the ""best option for me"" and ties it to a potential future action.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, drowning in the ocean is specified as the method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a conditional plan based on being kicked out, but no explicit preparations like acquiring means are detailed. However, the mention of a specific method qualifies as part of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current thoughts and potential future intentions, with no mention of past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (drowning), which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond vague ideation due to the detailed method and conditional intent. If unsure, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here the evidence supports 'Behavior'.

452,"Is life actually worth living anymore?. We've been in this pandemic for a year now and very little, if anything, seems to have improved. I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore. I can barely sleep without waking up in the middle of the night for no obvious reason. I think it's time for me to accept defeat.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, despair, and frustration due to the ongoing pandemic, lockdowns, unemployment fears, and personal struggles like sleep issues and university pressure. There are direct mentions of death and suicide, such as ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"" and ""Death seems a better option to me than living in this world."" Emotional indicators include phrases like ""I don't know if I can take it anymore,"" ""I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out,"" and ""I can hardly function anymore,"" which convey deep distress and a desire to end life. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor references to past attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"" and ""I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""Death seems a better option"" and ""I don't want to live in this world.""
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so this goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; it remains at the level of thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current and future intentions, such as ongoing struggles and fears (e.g., ""I fear that I will never see the world""), rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (e.g., ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?""), which fits 'ideation' as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide reference, not 'behavior' due to the absence of any plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of ""kill myself,"" which directly relates to suicide, and ""postpone any suicide attempts,"" indicating thoughts of suicide. There are emotional indicators of positivity mixed with underlying distress, as the user expresses excitement about Star Wars as a reason to delay suicidal actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the need for a reason not to kill themselves. Since it's clear, no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing notes or acquiring means is indicated. Since there's no explicit planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions, as it discusses postponing suicide attempts for the next decade. It does not describe past attempts; it's speculative about potential future actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts""), indicating a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits 'Ideation' best, as there are no details of planning or past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness, such as ""I have absolutely no will to live anymore,"" ""I'm tired and beaten,"" ""I just want to end it all,"" and descriptions of a miserable life with no friends, a shitty job, family, etc. There are mentions of wanting to die or end life, indicating emotional distress and a desire not to continue living. However, there are no references to specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts of suicide or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, such as ""I just want to end it all"" and ""no will to live anymore."" This qualifies as explicit suicidal thoughts since it clearly conveys a desire to end one's life. If unclear, I would lean toward 'indicator,' but here it's sufficiently direct to indicate suicidal feelings.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die. These indicate suicidal thoughts.

I dont know what options I have left. I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include complaints about a landlord reporting a dead body smell, neighbors keeping the user awake, severe sleep deprivation (e.g., only an hour of sleep per night), a recent diagnosis of MS, feelings of exhaustion, paranoia (e.g., ""My heads messing with me,"" ""everyone is in on it""), and a desire to escape the situation (e.g., ""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""I want to leave""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, and frustration, such as ""I cant take this torture,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell,"" and a general sense of suffering. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm directly related to the user. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; phrases like ""I just wanna leave this place"" and ""I want to leave"" suggest a desire to escape the current situation, but they do not explicitly indicate a wish to die or end one's life. Since this is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No; there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but since there's no indication of any plan, this step doesn't apply.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers primarily to current events and ongoing struggles (e.g., sleep deprivation, recent MS diagnosis, and present feelings of persecution). There are no references to past events, such as past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, and a vague desire to escape, but there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any plans. According to the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation.' There are no elements of 'Ideation,' 'Behavior,' or 'Attempt' present.

There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" and references to suicide notes (""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion (""i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year""). Specific plans or methods: It mentions a time (New Year's Eve) for ending it and past creation of suicide notes, which could indicate preparation. References to past attempts: The post notes making previous suicide notes, suggesting past preparations but not necessarily completed actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""ending it all"" and ""suicide notes.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I'm thinking of ending it all"" and ""I can't fucking do another year.""

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods (e.g., tools or substances), but a specific time is mentioned (New Year's Eve). Signs of preparation: Yes, the post references making suicide notes, which is listed as a form of preparation in the definitions. Since suicide notes indicate explicit planning, this leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events (e.g., losing friends, making previous suicide notes) and current/future intentions (e.g., thinking of ending it on New Year's Eve). The past notes suggest preparations but not completed attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die. It also mentions preparations like suicide notes and a specific time, which qualify as explicit planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of self-harm (""tried to cut myself""), emotional indicators like a breakdown, a very bad night, and being drunk, which suggest distress and impulsivity. There are no direct mentions of death, dying, or suicide, but self-harm is referenced. No specific plans, methods beyond the act itself, or preparations are detailed. It references a past attempt at self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No; the post focuses on self-harm during emotional distress, not a desire to die. Since it's not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context of a past action needs further evaluation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut myself"" implies a method, but it's not detailed as a plan. Are there signs of preparation? No; it seems impulsive. If uncertain about explicit planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this is about a past action, not current thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a past event (""last night""), specifically describing an action that was attempted, with no mention of current or future intentions. It is a reference to a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete past action of self-harm (""tried to cut myself""), which qualifies as a past attempt. According to the definitions, 'Attempt' is for historic actions like this, where a concrete action occurred. There are no current plans mentioned, so it fits 'Attempt' rather than 'Behavior'. It doesn't qualify as 'Ideation' because it's not just thoughts, and it's not 'Indicator' due to the description of a past attempt.

I hate pets, so it's not helping me either way. I want to kill myself, already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching. Already started to cancel friendships.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of chronic loneliness, lack of relationships (no girlfriend, friends), attempts to find solace in activities like hobbies and games which the user dismisses as ineffective, and a strong dislike for pets. There are explicit mentions of suicide (""I want to kill myself""), a specific timeline (""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching""), and actions indicating preparation (""Already started to cancel friendships""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair from ongoing struggles. No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are mentioned, but the timeline and canceling friendships suggest preparation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I want to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user states a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods like tools or substances are detailed. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions setting a date and starting to cancel friendships, which indicate planning and preparatory actions. Since there is evidence of a plan (date set) and preparations, this goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions, as the user discusses a date set in the past that is now approaching, indicating ongoing planning rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself""), which meets the criteria for ideation. However, it also mentions a specific plan (setting a date) and preparations (canceling friendships), which aligns with the definition of 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit, as it requires both thoughts and some form of plan or preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of dissatisfaction with life, such as ""This life doesnt fit me,"" feelings of acting a certain way for peace, and statements like ""i dont like to sleep all day i dont like to waste time but i have to so i dont kill myself."" There are direct mentions of suicide and killing oneself, indicating emotional distress like hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""so i dont kill myself"" and ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it implies a desire to avoid certain behaviors to prevent killing oneself. This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since there is no explicit plan, this aligns with choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and possible future intentions (e.g., to prevent killing oneself), but it does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as the desire to kill oneself and questioning the severity of suicide, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the 'Ideation' category, as it involves suicidal feelings without planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include repeated expressions of wanting to die, such as ""I want to die."" There are emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness, as the user describes themselves as a ""coward"" for not acting on these feelings. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). This qualifies as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, as it clearly indicates a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I want to die"" in the present tense), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of Ideation, as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It does not qualify as Indicator because of the direct suicidal expressions, nor as Behavior due to the absence of a plan, and not as Attempt since no past actions are described.

Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""throw myself off a bridge,"" ""ive been suicidal since i was 9,"" and ""i self-harmed."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""I cant take it,"" ""i hated myself and i was tired of everything around me,"" and ""i dont have the confidence to even say a word to them knowing it might as well be my last."" There are references to specific plans, such as ""Ive planned it all out"" and the method of throwing oneself off a bridge. Additionally, past self-harm is mentioned, indicating historical suicidal behavior.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as seen in phrases like ""throw myself off a bridge"" and ""ive been suicidal since i was 9."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), such as ""i dont want to be here"" and ""this is just a way of dying.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), including ""throw myself off a bridge."" Signs of preparation are present (Yes), as indicated by ""Ive planned it all out."" This goes beyond ideation, showing explicit planning, so it aligns more with behavior or attempt categories.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events, such as being suicidal since age 9 and past self-harm, but it primarily focuses on current or future intentions, like deciding to act on the plan soon. Past attempts (e.g., self-harm) are referenced alongside current plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific plan (e.g., method and preparation), and references to past attempts (self-harm). According to the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt,' even though it involves current elements.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I'm gonna commit suicide"" and ""twist my dick off,"" which directly reference dying and self-inflicted injury. Emotional indicators include frustration and hopelessness, as seen in ""I can't get a boner but I sure am gonna try here"" and ""I'm gonna wait it off a die of blood loss."" Specific plans or methods are mentioned, like twisting off a body part and dying from blood loss. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I'm gonna commit suicide"" and ""die of blood loss.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as twisting off a body part (implying self-harm leading to death) and dying of blood loss (a consequence of the injury). There are no clear signs of preparation like acquiring tools, but the description of methods qualifies as a plan. Since methods are explicitly stated, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by phrases like ""I'm gonna"" and ""gonna try here."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicide and includes specific plans or methods (e.g., self-harm leading to blood loss and death), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not just ideation because methods are described, and it is not an attempt since no past action is referenced.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of farewell (""Sayonara""), worsening health (""My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker""), anticipation of painful death (""I will eventually die in a much painful way""), endurance of pain and depression (""I endured the physical pain and mental depression for years""), and feelings of loneliness and purposelessness (""I am lonely and have no reason to live""). There are mentions of death and dying, emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair, but no references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? There is an indirect expression through ""I have no reason to live,"" which suggests a desire not to be alive, but it is not explicit or direct enough to clearly indicate suicidal thoughts. Since it is unclear and not very explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but in this case, it doesn't even reach that level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and future states (disease worsening and eventual painful death) as well as past endurance of pain and depression, but it does not describe any past suicide attempts or concrete future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general distress, hopelessness, and a vague sense of wanting to die due to health issues, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or killing oneself. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""people dying/committing suicide successfully,"" ""killing yourself,"" and ""I'll still be suicidal""). Emotional indicators show envy, despair, and self-disgust (e.g., ""Why can't that be me?"" and questioning the difficulty of suicide). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""committing suicide,"" ""killing yourself,"" and ""I'll still be suicidal""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""Why can't that be me?"" and envy of those who die).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user expressing a desire to die, fear of consequences like going to hell, feelings of having done bad things, belief in God without strong religiosity, isolation, and difficulty discussing these feelings.

No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""wants to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user clearly states a desire to die. This is explicit enough to move beyond 'indicator.'

The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of severe stress, anxiety, hopelessness, and emotional distress from school, lack of friends, family issues, and personal identity (atheism and bisexuality). There are mentions of death and suicide: specifically, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times."" Emotional indicators include crying themselves to sleep, loss of motivation, and feeling that their little brother is the only reason they're alive. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts, only thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" and the implication that their brother is the only thing keeping them alive, indicating a desire to not be alive.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the thoughts of killing themselves and the statement that their brother is the reason they're alive.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated.
   - Since no plan or method is described, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; it remains at the level of thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past thoughts (over the last 2 years) and current feelings of worsening stress and anxiety, with concerns about the future (e.g., school reopening). However, it does not describe any past attempts, only ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., thinking of killing themselves and desiring to end their life due to their brother being the only barrier), but there is no mention of a specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves desires to not be alive without explicit planning. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of plans, and not 'Attempt' since no past actions occurred.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct inquiry about ""how to die"" and a statement expressing a desire to ""definitely die."" There are mentions of death and dying, but no explicit reference to suicide or self-harm. Emotional indicators include desperation and a lack of concern for the process (e.g., ""I don't care if it's slow or painful""), suggesting hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post states ""I just want to definitely die,"" which expresses a desire to end one's life. However, since the mention is not explicitly the word ""suicide,"" and the instructions emphasize leaning toward 'indicator' if unclear, this creates some doubt.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post does not detail any tools, locations, substances, or preparations; it only asks where to find information. There are no signs of preparation. If uncertain about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but in this case, there's clearly no plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions, as it expresses a present desire to die and seeks information. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (""I just want to definitely die""), which aligns with the Ideation category's definition of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. Although the word ""suicide"" is not used, the desire to die is directly stated, making it more than just vague dissatisfaction. Per the rules, when in doubt about explicit mentions, I should choose 'indicator' over 'ideation', but here the expression of wanting to die is clear enough to qualify as Ideation rather than general hopelessness. There is no plan or past attempt, so it's not 'behavior' or 'attempt'.

I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying through phrases like ""will to die,"" ""desire to die,"" and ""attempt again."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, tiredness, and indifference, as seen in expressions like ""I'm tired of buying time,"" ""I just don't really want one [a future],"" and ""constant fear and pain."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. References to past attempts are implied with ""if I do attempt again,"" suggesting a history but not detailing it.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through references to ""will to die,"" ""attempt again,"" and not wanting a future.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I just don't really want one either"" (referring to a future) and ""familiar will to die.""
   - The mentions are explicit enough to go beyond vague feelings.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post mentions ""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"" and ""I've made enough plans to look forward to,"" but these seem to refer to delaying actions through life events rather than explicit suicide preparations. Since it's uncertain if this constitutes a specific plan, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (implied past attempts with ""attempt again"") and current/future intentions (ongoing thoughts and a vague timeline of ""at least a few months out""). The primary focus is on current feelings rather than detailed past descriptions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die), making it more than an 'indicator.' It does not describe a specific plan or method, so it doesn't qualify as 'behavior.' While a past attempt is implied, the content focuses on current ideation rather than detailing past actions, so 'attempt' is not the best fit. Overall, it aligns with 'ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a clear plan.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies a gun to the head as the preferred method and mentions temptation to use a kitchen knife.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, there is a clear plan involving waiting 480 days for access to a gun, indicating forethought and preparation.
   - Since specific methods and a timeline are described, this goes beyond ideation into behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current thoughts and future intentions, such as ongoing temptations and the planned wait period. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and desires, but it also mentions specific methods (gun, knife) and a plan (waiting 480 days), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it directly states intent to kill oneself.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Bridge"" implies a location/method for suicide (e.g., jumping). 
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of a specific time (""on Monday"") suggests planning, though no further details like acquiring means are provided. This qualifies as explicit planning based on the definitions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to future intentions (""going to try and kill myself on Monday""), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (method: bridge; time: Monday), which aligns with the ""Behavior"" category. It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a method and preparation indicators, so ""Behavior"" fits best. If unsure, the rules specify choosing ""ideation"" over ""behavior,"" but here it's clear.

479,Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track. Tried to sleep but then changed the wallpaper. Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms. Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it. And it's just can't get this girl out of my head. Good fore to stay away though. Not cool to start something and then  just kms. Gah but it's so hard. One of the hardest decisions I've taken iny life. Wish I have more sex before I go though lol. Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""hangman's noose"" as a wallpaper, which implies a method of suicide (hanging). It includes ""kms"" (kill myself), explicit references to planning suicide, such as ""when I do it"" and overcoming a hurdle to kms. Emotional indicators include despair about relationships (""can't get this girl out of my head""), life decisions (""one of the hardest decisions""), and societal pressures (""Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD""). There are hints of preparation (setting wallpaper as a reminder) and references to past events (""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"").
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: Yes, through ""kms,"" ""hangman's noose,"" and ""when I do it.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and regret are evident.
   - Specific plans/methods: ""Hangman's noose"" is a specific method; ""overcame a big hurdle to kms"" suggests past preparation or attempt.
   - References to past attempts: ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" indicates a recent past event related to suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kms"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""when I do it,"" wishing for experiences ""before I go"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""hangman's noose"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., setting wallpaper as a reminder to stay on track for suicide).
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here it's explicit.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events? Yes (""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" suggests a past attempt or close event).
   - Does this refer to current/future intentions? Yes (""when I do it"" implies future plans).
   - Past attempts are referenced, and current plans are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""hangman's noose""), which could lean toward 'behavior.' However, it also references a past event (""overcame a big hurdle to kms""), potentially indicating a past attempt. Additionally, it mentions current plans (""when I do it""). According to the rules, if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt.'

I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore. i'm only 19 and I feel like i've seen enough of my future to want to continue. someone please help me,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die""), feelings of pain and mental clutter (""I wanna stop hearing my thoughts and feeling this pain""), hopelessness (""I feel like I wasn't supposed to be born,"" ""I'm a failure,"" ""I haven't been happy in 2 years""), and dissatisfaction with life (""I don't know how to undo the mess I've done with my life""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm beyond the desire to die. Emotional indicators include despair, anxiety, and depression. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I don't want to be me anymore,"" indicating a desire to end one's existence.
   - Since ""I want to die"" is a direct expression, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as it's not just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no plan is evident, this fits ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future hopelessness (e.g., ""I've seen enough of my future to want to continue""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die) but lacks any specific plan or method, making it best categorized as 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'Indicator', and there's no evidence of planning or past attempts, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, and distress about failing as a father. The user mentions feeling like their son would be better off without them and ends with ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with."" This implies a desire to end their life but doesn't specify methods or preparations. Emotional indicators include despair and self-deprecation. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly, no specific plans, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""he'll be better off without me"" and ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" suggest a desire to end one's life, though it's vague.
   - Since it's not entirely clear if this constitutes an explicit mention, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions, but the context strongly implies suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Here, there's no indication of a plan, so it doesn't qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""I've been thinking about...""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not be alive) without any specific plan, which aligns with 'Ideation'. Although the mention is vague, it goes beyond general distress by implying a desire to end life, fitting the definition of explicit suicidal feelings. If it were purely general dissatisfaction without this implication, it would be 'Indicator', but the phrasing tips it toward 'Ideation'.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post contains key elements such as multiple mentions of death, dying, and suicide (e.g., past attempts with aspirin, gun, and rope, and current preparation with an exit bag). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, loneliness, anxiety, numbness from depression, and depersonalization. Specific plans and methods are detailed, such as researching and preparing suicide methods (aspirin overdose, gun aiming, rope for hanging, and exit bag with gas). References to past attempts are explicit.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), with direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), such as describing desires to end life and past actions taken toward that end.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), including tools like aspirin, gun, rope, and exit bag with gas, along with signs of preparation (e.g., purchasing items, researching techniques, and setting up the exit bag). Since explicit planning is present, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., attempts at age 15 and 21, and a recent hanging attempt) as well as current and potential future intentions (e.g., the prepared exit bag and ongoing fears).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes past suicide attempts (e.g., taking pills, attempting with a gun and rope), which fits the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans, and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. This overrides other categories like 'Behavior' or 'Ideation' based on the provided definitions.

No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""should just end my life.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no details about methods or preparations, this does not qualify as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and future intentions, not past events. No past attempts are described.

There are no mentions of self-harm methods, specific preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes, ""I'm about to kill myself""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes, implied in not seeing a reason to live).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are mentioned. There are no signs of preparation described. Since it's unclear if there's an explicit plan, I should lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or imminent intentions (""I'm about to""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill oneself), but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress such as ""I'm done. I'm too pissed, don't even want to feel good anymore, just gonna embrace the pain,"" which indicate hopelessness and despair. There are mentions of death and dying, like ""face death,"" ""until I die or pass out,"" and the implication in ""if I survived"" and ""if not, well, you know what happened."" No specific references to suicide, self-harm methods beyond excessive working out, or past attempts are present. The post describes an intention to engage in an activity (working out) that could lead to harm or death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""face death"" and ""until I die"" suggest a desire to die. Since it's not explicitly mentioning suicide, but there are clear indicators of wanting to die, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the expressions are direct enough to move beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post describes a plan to ""start working out until I die or pass out,"" which could be interpreted as a method of self-harm leading to death through overexertion. There are signs of preparation, as the person outlines the action and sets a timeline (""I'll be back in 12 hours if I survived""). If uncertain about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here the plan is specified as an immediate action with potential fatal outcome.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions, as it describes what the person is ""now gonna start"" doing and what might happen in the next 12 hours. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""face death""), which goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'indicator.' It also mentions a specific plan (working out until death), qualifying it as more than just ideation. This fits 'behavior' because there are suicidal thoughts combined with an explicit plan or method. Although the method isn't a traditional one like pills or weapons, it meets the criteria for preparations and intent. If unsure, I would choose 'ideation,' but the details here support 'behavior.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide (""I have contemplated suicide for years,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" and ""if I plan to be dead long before I retire""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, such as questioning the purpose of saving for retirement due to planned suicide. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no references to past attempts; it's focused on future intentions.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I plan to be dead long before I retire.""

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only a vague timeline (e.g., ""maybe in my 20's or 30's"") is mentioned, but nothing concrete like acquiring means or writing a note.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., contemplating and planning to do it in the future), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (e.g., ""I know I am going to do it""), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include an inquiry about whether duloxetine (a medication) can kill, which implies interest in its lethality, and a statement about having a few pills saved for later. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly. No emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair are present. There might be an implication of preparation with ""saving for later,"" but it's not tied to suicide. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The content is indirect and focuses on the drug's potential lethality, so I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' due to the lack of explicitness.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, duloxetine pills are referenced as a potential means. Are there signs of preparation? Possibly, with ""saving for later,"" but it's not explicitly linked to suicide or self-harm. Since it's uncertain whether this constitutes an explicit plan for suicide, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules, but overall, the lack of explicit suicidal thoughts makes it lean toward 'indicator'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current possession (having pills) and potential future intentions (""for later""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or clear plans for suicide. While there are hints of a method and preparation, suicide is not mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'ideation' or 'behavior'. Based on the rules, when in doubt about explicit mentions, I choose 'indicator'.

   - Key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress such as ""I've been lying when I say it's not that bad,"" ""Today's a great day. It's hell,"" ""I feel so empire [likely 'empty'],"" and ""So out of place."" There is a mention of wanting to ""end"" but no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) The word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) The phrase ""I just want to end but haven't yet"" implies a desire to end one's life, though it's not fully explicit.
   - Since this is somewhat unclear, I am leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) No tools, locations, substances, or preparations are referenced.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) Nothing indicates any steps toward action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""I just want to end but haven't yet""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction and a vague desire to ""end,"" but lacks explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation.' There are no plans or past attempts, so it's not 'Ideation,' 'Behavior,' or 'Attempt.'

I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and dying, such as ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""I cant off myself."" The phrase ""off myself"" is a slang term for suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, fatigue, procrastination, and internal conflict (e.g., brain as the body's worst enemy). There are references to a potential method, specifically ""buy the gas,"" which implies a means for suicide. No specific plans, preparations, or references to past attempts are detailed beyond this.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""off myself,"" which directly refers to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I could be dead by the end of the day today.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""buy the gas"" indicates a potential method for suicide (e.g., using gas for poisoning). 
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is an implication of needing to take action (leaving the house to buy gas), but no explicit signs of active preparation like writing a note or acquiring items. Since a method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as seen in phrases like ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and the ongoing struggle with fatigue preventing action. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die) and mentions a specific method (""buy the gas""), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by referencing a means, even if not fully planned or executed. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide, as the user says ""I post about suicide constantly"" and implies ""do it"" refers to suicide. There are emotional indicators of frustration, self-criticism, and despair, such as ""stop being a pussy"" and ""suck it up,"" which suggest hopelessness. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""post about suicide constantly"" and the implied ""do it"" in the context of suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user expresses a desire to ""do it already,"" indicating a wish to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no explicit plan is present, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing how to act on them.

I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user's struggles with school, self-harm (cutting their leg), past unexecuted plans to kill themselves, and current explicit plans for suicide. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as planning to kill themselves and specific methods like hanging and cutting off a finger. Emotional indicators include feelings of unmotivation, relief from dropping classes, and a ""weird"" happiness mixed with despair. Specific plans and methods are detailed, including preparations like having a rope, axe, and car ready. References to past self-harm (cutting) are present, but no full past suicide attempts are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January"" and ""I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through statements like ""it's time to stop the lie and end it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, methods include hanging with a rope, cutting off a finger with an axe, and using a car (likely for transport to the location). Signs of preparation are evident, as the user says ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car."" This indicates explicit planning, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post refers to past events like self-harm and a previous unexecuted plan in January, but the focus is on current and future intentions, such as the new plan to hang themselves. There are no descriptions of a completed past suicide attempt, only self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and includes specific plans and preparations (e.g., rope, axe, car), which fits the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not just 'Ideation' because of the detailed plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past completed attempts described.

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of existential despair and questioning the meaning of life, such as ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"" and ""I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die."" There are mentions of death in a general, philosophical sense, and emotional indicators of hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, like ""It's the dumbest shit ever"" and ""there still is no point for us being here."" However, there are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as the post states ""I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die,"" which expresses regret about existence but not a desire to end life. Since this is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but in this case, it's clearly absent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and general thoughts about life, with no indication of past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as suicide is not mentioned, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'. There are no elements of plans, methods, or past attempts, so 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt' do not apply.

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's feelings of shame and embarrassment about buying a used pocket pussy, which has led to social ridicule. They mention starting Nofap due to this incident and express fear about starting a new school where people might judge them based on this. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include shame, anxiety, and a sense of being disgusting, but these are tied to social judgment rather than hopelessness about life in general. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are present, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on social distress and fear of judgment, with no indication of suicidal thoughts. Since there's no explicit mention, I lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There's no discussion of any plans related to suicide, so this doesn't factor into a higher category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (buying the item and starting Nofap) and current/future worries (starting a new school and potential judgment), but none of this involves suicidal intentions or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and sadness related to social shame, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, desires to die, plans, or past attempts. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it lacks any explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, we choose 'indicator', and here it's clear.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses frustration and anger towards family for bringing the person into the world and not allowing them to ""kill yourself."" It mentions ""kill yourself"" directly, indicating suicide. Emotional indicators include feelings of suffering, selfishness of family, and a sense of being forced to endure for others' sake, showing despair and hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill yourself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the context of wanting to end life due to suffering, though not in first-person terms like ""I want to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of any actions taken.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and frustrations, not past events or future intentions specifically. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide and expressions of wanting to end life due to suffering, which qualifies as suicidal thoughts. However, there are no specific plans or methods, so it fits 'Ideation' best, as it involves explicit suicidal feelings without planning.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness (""lol god damn am i lonely""), feelings of being uncared for (""nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever""), self-deprecation (""Im such a spoiled piece of shit""), and direct pleas for ending life (""pls fucking end me before the day. pls""). There are mentions of wanting to die or suicide implied through ""im going to do it"" and ""pls fucking end me."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""im going to do it"" (implying suicide) and ""pls fucking end me"" (direct expression of wanting to die). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes. Since it's explicit, it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. This is just a general expression of intent without details, so it leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and possible future intentions (e.g., ""im going to do it"" and ""before the day""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die), but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing how. It's not 'Indicator' because of the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as there's no reference to past actions.

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a hope for the user to be the next victim of a stabbing in their area, and a comparison to suicide, noting that a stabbing would avoid bringing shame to the family. There are mentions of death (hoping to be stabbed), and suicide is explicitly referenced as an alternative that would be shameful. Emotional indicators include despair and a desire to end life without the stigma of suicide. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned by the user, nor any references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used directly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the user's hope to be stabbed next, which implies a desire to die. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans away from 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Stabbing is mentioned, but it is described as an external event happening in the area, not as a plan or method the user intends to use themselves. There are no signs of preparation, such as acquiring tools or writing notes. Since there is no explicit plan from the user, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; instead, it aligns more with 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (hoping to be stabbed next), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, as it mentions suicide and expresses a desire to die (via hoping for a stabbing), but without any specific plan or preparation. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' best, as there is a clear desire to not be alive without detailing a method or steps. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, 'Behavior' due to the lack of a plan, or 'Attempt' since no past actions are referenced.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""killmyself"" and ""put an end to it all""), as well as emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as having no friends, no social life, no skills, no job, no money, and feeling blocked by family. There are references to plans like disappearing, going to another country, getting a new identity, and making it look like an accident to kill themselves without anyone knowing. No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) or references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""killmyself"" and ""put an end to it all."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user expresses a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not detailed (e.g., no mention of weapons or substances), but there are signs of preparation, such as planning to go to another country, acquire a new identity, and stage it as an accident to facilitate suicide. This indicates explicit ideas of how to carry out the act, which qualifies as a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions (e.g., how to disappear and kill themselves), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a plan (e.g., changing identity and location to enable suicide), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. Although the plan is not highly detailed, it involves specific preparations, making 'Behavior' the best fit over 'Ideation,' as per the guidelines to choose 'Behavior' if specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present.

498,"I'm still here, but I had enough of this. Hey there. Unfortunately, I'm still alive. I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets, but EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE. WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY!. I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!. THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!. I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include explicit descriptions of a past suicide attempt (suffocation using a mask and plastic bag), expressions of frustration and desire to die, emotional indicators of hopelessness and anger (e.g., ""I had enough of this,"" ""WHY! WHY! WHY!""), and mentions of future plans (trying again tonight and a more painful Plan B). There are direct references to death, dying, and suicide, along with emotional distress related to depression and God.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, explicitly stated (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself,"" ""I ALMOST FUCKING DIED"").
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, anger, and frustration.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, describes a method (suffocation with mask and bag), and mentions preparing to try again tonight with a backup plan (Plan B, described as more painful).
   - References to past attempts: Yes, details a specific attempt from last night.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself last night"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL,"" ""THIS NEEDS TO END"").
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., suffocation method with mask and bag; Plan B as more painful, implying another method).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, as they attempted it and are planning to retry, indicating ongoing preparation.
   - Since explicit planning is present, this goes beyond mere ideation, but I'll consider the full context for categorization.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (the attempt last night) and current/future intentions (planning to try again tonight and having Plan B).
   - Past attempts are specifically described, and current plans are also mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes a past suicide attempt and also includes current plans, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category definition: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" It is not just 'Indicator' (no explicit suicide), 'Ideation' (has plans, not just thoughts), or 'Behavior' (while it includes planning, the past attempt with current plans overrides to 'Attempt').

I'm just soooo tierd, I just want to sleep 24/7, I feel empty and I'm worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include feelings of extreme tiredness, a desire to sleep constantly, emptiness, and worry about ruining friendships due to another depressive episode. The user also mentions positive aspects of their life, such as playing rugby with an inclusive team, starting university, having a supportive boyfriend and best friend, and being on HRT for 4 months. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include tiredness, emptiness, and concern about depression, suggesting distress but not explicit hopelessness or despair. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses fatigue and emotional emptiness but does not reference suicide or a desire to end life. Since it's unclear and leans toward general distress, I am choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plans or means related to suicide, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings (e.g., tiredness and emptiness) and potential future concerns (e.g., ruining friendships due to another depressive episode), but not to past suicide attempts or future suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and sadness without any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings. Even with mentions of emotional emptiness and worry, without explicit suicide references, it fits 'Indicator' best.
