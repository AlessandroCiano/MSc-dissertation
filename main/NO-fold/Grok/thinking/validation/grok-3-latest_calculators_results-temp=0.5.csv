0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of ""ending my life again,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. There is also a specific mention of a method and location: ""go to a bridge and jump off.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and self-hatred (""everything in my life is crap even me,"" ""hate being gay,"" ""hate being myself"").
   - Specific plan is mentioned with the reference to a bridge and jumping off.
   - There is a vague reference to past thoughts with ""again,"" but no specific description of a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned with ""ending my life again."" (Yes)
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die with ""ending my life"" and ""want to go to a bridge and jump off."" (Yes)

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method and location are mentioned: ""go to a bridge and jump off."" (Yes)
   - No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing a note) are mentioned, but the mention of a specific method and location suggests a plan.
   - Since a specific method and location are mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current intentions (""thinking about ending my life again,"" ""want to go to a bridge and jump off""), not just past events.
   - The word ""again"" suggests past thoughts, but no specific past attempt is described, so it does not qualify as 'attempt.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""ending my life again""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond vague ideation due to the mention of a specific method and location (""go to a bridge and jump off""), which aligns with 'behavior.'
   - There is no detailed description of a past attempt, only a vague reference to past thoughts with ""again,"" so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Based on the explicit mention of a plan (method and location), 'behavior' is the most appropriate category.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The user states they are ""inconsolable"" and mentions ""I'm going to die soon.""
   - Mentions of death: Yes, there is a reference to dying soon.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Inconsolable"" suggests deep distress or hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There is no indication of how or why they believe they will die soon.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not directly mention suicide or killing oneself.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly. ""I'm going to die soon"" could imply a prediction or feeling rather than a desire or intent to die.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I will lean toward 'indicator'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no tools, locations, or substances mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there is no planning mentioned.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a future event (""going to die soon""), but the context or intent is unclear.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses distress and a vague statement about dying soon, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to end one’s life. There is also no mention of a plan or past attempt. As per the rules, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the classification should lean toward 'indicator'. The statement ""I'm going to die soon"" is ambiguous and does not clearly indicate suicidal intent or ideation. Therefore, 'indicator' is the most appropriate category.

   - Emotional indicators: There is clear distress and dissatisfaction with life.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post expresses hatred for living but does not explicitly state a desire to die or end their life.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no mention of planning or methods, 'behavior' is not applicable.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post reflects current feelings of dissatisfaction, not past events or future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows distress and dissatisfaction with life but lacks explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. There are no plans, methods, or references to past attempts. As per the guidelines, even strong dissatisfaction or hopelessness without explicit mention of suicide falls under 'indicator'. Since there is doubt about whether suicidal intent is explicitly expressed, I will classify this as 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide are present: ""I want to call it a day and kill myself,"" ""I want to die now, right now in this instant,"" and references to methods like ""run towards a cop with a knife"" or ""find a dealer with some opioids.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and isolation: ""I don’t have anything,"" ""I’m stuck, stagnant,"" ""I’ve been falling down this void for like 5 or 6 years,"" and ""I can’t feel nothing.""
   - Specific plans or methods are mentioned: running towards a cop with a knife and finding a dealer for opioids.
   - No references to past attempts are made; the focus is on current feelings and potential actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct statements like ""kill myself"" and ""I want to die now.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, multiple times, such as ""I want to die now, right now in this instant"" and desiring a button to ""erase all traces of my existence.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post mentions ""run towards a cop with a knife"" and ""find a dealer with some opioids.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, as the methods are mentioned as possibilities (""I don’t know, I wouldn’t know"") rather than concrete actions or acquisitions.
   - Since there is mention of specific methods, even if not fully planned out, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings and potential future actions (""right now in this instant,"" ""either I run towards a cop..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond mere thoughts of not wanting to live (ideation) because specific methods are mentioned (running towards a cop with a knife, finding opioids), which aligns with 'behavior.'
   - Although the planning is not fully concrete (e.g., no mention of having the knife or drugs), the explicit mention of methods fits the definition of 'behavior' as per the guidelines (""mentions even if only briefly a plan to commit suicide"").
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'behavior.'

The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of wanting to ""get it over with,"" which suggests a desire to end their life.
   - Emotional indicators include despair and deterioration, as well as fear of pain associated with the act.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are present.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by name, but there is an implied desire to end life with phrases like ""get it over with"" and concern about ""the pain if I go through with it.""
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to escape their current situation, which leans toward suicidal ideation. Since it is not entirely explicit, I will consider the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context strongly suggests a desire to die.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains an implied desire to not be alive anymore (""get it over with"" and fear of pain associated with the act), which aligns with suicidal thoughts. However, since suicide is not explicitly mentioned by name, and the rule states to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I must consider this carefully. Despite the ambiguity, the context of wanting to escape suffering and fearing pain if they ""go through with it"" strongly suggests ideation. There is no mention of a specific plan or past attempt, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable. Given the guidelines to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit mention, I will classify this as 'indicator' due to the lack of direct mention of suicide or killing oneself.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress and feelings of abandonment, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die.

   - References to past attempts: There are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states, ""i plan to kill myself at 21.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement about planning to kill themselves indicates a desire to not be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Not applicable, as the mention of suicide is explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to commit suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of concrete actions like writing notes or acquiring means. The mention of ""at 21"" is a timeline but lacks specificity regarding how it will be done.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no specific method or preparation is mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings of despair and a future intention to kill themselves at age 21.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains an explicit mention of suicide with the statement ""i plan to kill myself at 21,"" which rules out 'indicator.'
   - There is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'ideation.'
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'ideation,' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide explicitly (""the only way out is suicide"") and thoughts of ""making an escape.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feeling overwhelmed, empty, scared, and stuck in a ""rat race.""
   - Specific method mentioned: ""I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it.""
   - No references to past attempts, only current thoughts and feelings.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""the only way out is suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""the only way out is suicide"" and ""make my escape"").
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this moves beyond 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging is explicitly considered (""I've considered hanging"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post states they ""can't seem to go through with it,"" indicating no active preparation or steps taken.
   - Since there is a specific method mentioned but no clear preparation or intent to act, I lean toward 'behavior' due to the mention of a method, but must confirm if this meets the threshold.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current thoughts and feelings, no past attempts described.
   - No past attempts specifically described, so 'attempt' category is not applicable.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to escape life, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It also mentions a specific method (hanging), which suggests 'behavior' as per the definition that includes even brief mentions of a plan or method.
   - However, the user states they ""can't seem to go through with it,"" indicating no active preparation or intent to act imminently. Per the rule, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - Given the explicit mention of a method, I believe 'behavior' is appropriate as the definition includes any mention of a specific method, even without preparation.
   - Final check: No past attempts mentioned, so 'attempt' is not relevant. The mention of a method tips this into 'behavior' despite hesitation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of suicide (""i'm going to kill myself"") and a clear intent to end their life.
   - Emotional indicators show determination and hopelessness (""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"").
   - Specific preparations are mentioned (""i already got my suicidal notes ready"").
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Direct expression of wanting to die: Yes (""i'm going to kill myself"" and ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are not mentioned; the post only states ""just a matter of when and how"" without detailing tools, locations, or substances.
   - Signs of preparation are present: suicide notes are ready (""i already got my suicidal notes ready"").
   - Since a specific method or detailed plan is not mentioned, but preparation (notes) is evident, this leans toward a plan being in place.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""i'm going to kill myself"", ""just a matter of when and how"").
   - No mention of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere thoughts of not wanting to live ('ideation') due to the mention of preparation (suicide notes).
   - While a specific method is not detailed, the preparation of notes indicates a step toward action, fitting the definition of 'behavior' as it includes ""some form of explicit planning like preparations taken (e.g., suicide note)"".
   - Since there is no mention of past attempts, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit intent and preparation, 'behavior' is the best fit over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no mention of planning or methods, 'behavior' is not applicable.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post lacks any explicit mention of suicide or desire to die. It focuses on self-hatred and a wish to be someone else, which falls under general distress and dissatisfaction. As per the rules, even strong hopelessness or dissatisfaction without explicit mention of suicide or dying classifies as 'indicator'. Therefore, the best category is 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of others posting about killing themselves or being in the process of doing so, but this is not about the person writing the post.
   - No personal emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, or distress are expressed by the poster themselves.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned regarding the poster's own actions or intentions.
   - No references to past attempts by the poster.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in reference to others, not the poster themselves.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive by the poster? No, the post does not indicate any personal suicidal thoughts or feelings.
   - Since the mention of suicide is not about the poster, it leans toward 'indicator' as per the rule that suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not in relation to the poster.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not applicable to the poster.
   - Since there is no personal intent or planning expressed, this does not reach the level of 'behavior' or even 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit statements like ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""tired of being alive,"" and ""want to be brave enough to kill myself."" 
   - Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present (""I'm so tired and sad,"" ""it's never going to happen"").
   - There is a reference to past attempts (""the past two times I've tried I've failed"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for a current suicide attempt are mentioned.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned for a current plan.
   - No signs of current preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.

   - Past attempts are specifically mentioned, though not described in detail.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of wanting to die and kill oneself qualifies this as beyond 'indicator.'
   - The lack of a specific current plan or method means it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - The reference to past attempts suggests 'attempt' as a possible category, and per the rule, if a post refers to past attempts and current thoughts/plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Given the rule to prioritize 'attempt' when past attempts and current ideation are both present, this fits 'attempt' over 'ideation.'

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide are present with explicit phrases like ""desire to kill myself"" and ""killing myself is painful.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and frustration, as seen in statements like ""what reason is there to live"" and ""I just want out of that tunnel.""
   - Specific plans or methods are referenced with the metaphor of ""getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape,"" which suggests a method of suicide.
   - References to past attempts are explicit, with mentions of overdosing twice in the past two weeks and three times in the past six months.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct phrases like ""desire to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""I just want out of that tunnel"" and contemplating killing oneself.
   - No ambiguity here; suicide is clearly mentioned.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, there is a reference to ""getting hit by an incoming train"" as a means to escape, which can be interpreted as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No concrete signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes) are mentioned.
   - Although the method is mentioned metaphorically, it is specific enough to suggest a plan, but since there is also a past attempt, I will consider the full context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both are present. There are explicit mentions of past overdose attempts (twice in two weeks, three in six months) and current thoughts of wanting to die with a potential method (train).
   - Past attempts are specifically described with details of overdosing.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, fitting 'ideation.'
   - It also mentions a potential method (""getting hit by an incoming train""), which could suggest 'behavior,' but it is not clear if this is a concrete plan or a metaphorical expression.
   - Most critically, there are explicit references to past suicide attempts (overdosing multiple times), which aligns with the 'attempt' category.
   - Per the rules, if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans or thoughts, it should be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, despite the current ideation and possible behavior indicators, the presence of past attempts takes precedence as per the definition.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress, fear, and overwhelm but does not mention suicide, a desire to die, or any plans or past attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include extreme hopelessness (""There is NO hope left""), extensive history of failed mental health treatments, financial struggles, and a statement about ending it (""Now it's time to end it"").
   - Emotional indicators are present with strong despair and frustration over ineffective treatments and dire living conditions.
   - There is a direct implication of wanting to end life, though no specific method or plan is mentioned.
   - No explicit mention of past attempts with specific actions (just vague ""I tried""), and no specific current plan or preparation is described.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned by term, but there is a clear expression of intent to end life (""Now it's time to end it"").
   - There is a direct expression of not wanting to continue living, as implied by the context and final statement.
   - Since it is not entirely vague but leans toward intent, I will not default to 'indicator' over 'ideation'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned for ending life.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past efforts (treatments and vague ""I tried"") and a current/future intention to ""end it.""
   - No past attempts are specifically described with concrete actions (e.g., overdose or specific self-harm); ""I tried"" is too vague to classify as a past attempt.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to end life (""Now it's time to end it""), which moves it beyond 'indicator.'
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - The vague reference to ""I tried"" does not provide enough detail to classify as a past 'attempt' with concrete action.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit desire to not live without a specific plan.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the mention of a ""note and date"" indicates preparation.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': While the plan is not detailed (no specific method), the mention of a note and date suggests concrete steps toward a plan, leaning toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current feelings and future intentions (early April date).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses a desire to die (""not scared to die"") and hopelessness, which goes beyond a vague 'indicator.'
   - It includes explicit suicidal thoughts, fitting 'ideation,' but also mentions a plan with a note and date for early April, which aligns with 'behavior.'
   - There are no past attempts mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the mention of preparation (note and date), even without a specific method, the post fits 'behavior' as it shows concrete steps toward a plan. The rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure does not fully apply here since the preparation is explicitly stated.

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care. If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicidal thoughts: The user explicitly states, ""I'm going to kill myself"" and refers to the possibility of going ""through with it and kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of intense distress, anger (""like a rabid dog""), hopelessness (""no one would care or miss me""), and feeling overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts.
   - Self-harm references: Mentions ""cuts I have all over myself,"" indicating possible self-harming behavior.
   - Specific plans or methods: The user discusses checking into a mental health institution as an alternative to suicide but does not specify a method or plan for ending their life. The mention of potentially ending up ""dead in a gutter"" is vague and not a concrete plan.
   - No references to past attempts: The post focuses on current thoughts and potential future actions, not past events.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states, ""I'm going to kill myself"" and mentions the possibility of going ""through with it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, there are clear statements of intent to kill themselves if they do not check into a hospital.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there is no mention of tools, locations, substances, or specific means to commit suicide. The idea of ending up ""dead in a gutter"" is not a concrete plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of preparations such as writing a note or acquiring means. The user is still debating their next steps and has not left home.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current struggles and future possibilities (checking into a hospital or potentially killing themselves). There is no mention of past attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself""), which rules out 'indicator.'
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for committing suicide, only a vague reference to possibly ending up dead, which does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation,' as it reflects explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide: The post explicitly says ""I can't kill myself"" and identifies as ""suicidal.""
   - Emotional indicators: Feelings of exhaustion (""I'm so tired""), worthlessness (""I'm not special to anything or anyone""), and disconnection (""there's no me at this point"").
   - Specific plans or methods: Mentions a ""good cliff"" and the distance to it (4-5km), indicating knowledge of a location for potential suicide.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts, only current thoughts and struggles.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I can't kill myself"" and ""I'm suicidal.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses suicidal thoughts and identifies as suicidal.
   - Since it's explicit, this moves beyond 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a specific location (a cliff) is mentioned, along with the distance to it and the possibility of getting there.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No concrete preparation is mentioned (e.g., no indication of going to the cliff or taking steps to do so), only knowledge of the location and a lack of commitment to act on it.
   - Since there is a specific location mentioned but no active preparation or intent to act immediately, I lean toward 'behavior' due to the mention of a method/location, but I must consider if this is explicit enough for planning or just ideation.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and thoughts, with no mention of past attempts.
   - No past attempts described, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""I can't kill myself,"" ""I'm suicidal""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It also mentions a specific location (cliff) and the distance to it, which suggests a potential method or plan. However, there is no indication of active preparation or immediate intent to act on this knowledge (""I just can't commit to it"").
   - Per the rules, if a specific method or location is mentioned, even briefly, it leans toward 'behavior.' The mention of the cliff as a ""good"" location for suicide indicates some level of planning or consideration, even if not acted upon.
   - Since there is no mention of past attempts, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of suicide and a specific location, I classify this as 'behavior' rather than 'ideation,' as the definition of 'behavior' includes mentioning a plan or method, even if briefly.

No direct statement of wanting to die, though ""wish I was never born"" and ""want it all to stop"" suggest a vague desire to escape life. However, these are not explicit enough to confirm a desire to die or commit suicide. As per guidelines, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress and vague feelings of wanting life to stop, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. As per the rules, even large general dissatisfaction with life and hopelessness falls under 'indicator' if suicide or killing oneself is not explicitly mentioned. The guideline to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt applies here.

   - Emotional indicators include despair and isolation (""no one really understands,"" ""doubt anyone will care"").
   - Specific plans or methods are hinted at with ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" and a timeline of ""wait a few weeks.""
   - No explicit mention of past attempts, though there is a reference to having ""tried that before,"" which likely refers to seeking help rather than a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""end it all,"" which strongly implies suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user clearly states they are ""ready to just end it all.""

   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a vague timeline (""wait a few weeks""), but no concrete evidence of preparation like acquiring means or writing notes.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a desire for death with statements like ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it.""

   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly beyond holding the blade; no mention of further steps like writing a note or acquiring other means.
   - Since a specific method (blade) is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior,' but I must consider if the mention is tied to a concrete plan or just a thought. The user states they ""can't do it,"" which suggests no immediate intent or finalized plan. If uncertain, the rule is to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' so I will lean toward 'ideation' unless a clear plan is evident.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up.

   - No explicit mentions of suicide, death, or self-harm as literal actions. The desire to ""not exist"" is present but vague in terms of intent or action.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide or self-harm are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts at suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post does not directly reference suicide or killing oneself. The phrase ""I just want to not exist"" is a vague expression of wanting to escape life but does not explicitly mention suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user states, ""I just want to not exist,"" which indicates a desire to not be alive, though it is not explicitly tied to suicide.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, as per the guideline to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' when unclear, I will consider this carefully.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. There are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any concrete means of ending life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings of distress and a vague desire to escape life, with no reference to past attempts or specific future actions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains significant emotional distress and a vague expression of not wanting to exist, which could suggest suicidal ideation. However, the guidelines emphasize that suicide must be explicitly mentioned to move beyond 'indicator.' The statement ""I just want to not exist"" is not an explicit mention of suicide or a clear intent to die by one's own actions. It could be interpreted as a desire for escape rather than a direct suicidal thought.
   - There is no mention of specific plans or methods, so 'behavior' is not applicable.
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Given the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, and since the post lacks a clear, direct reference to suicide or killing oneself, I will classify this as 'indicator.' The distress and hopelessness are severe, but without explicit mention of suicide, it aligns with the 'indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include repeated expressions of wanting to die and hating being alive, indicating severe emotional distress.
   - Explicit mentions of wanting to end it and desiring death are present.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-hatred, worthlessness, and loneliness.
   - Specific mention of a method: ""put a bullet right through it,"" suggesting a firearm as a means of suicide.

   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive are repeated multiple times. (Yes)
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""put a bullet right through it,"" which implies the use of a firearm.
   - No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note) are mentioned, but the method is clearly stated.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts with repeated desires to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - The mention of a specific method (""bullet right through it"") suggests a plan or means, which aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'
   - Since there are no references to past attempts, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of a method, 'behavior' is the most fitting category, as it meets the criteria of suicidal thoughts combined with a specific means.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide and being on ""suicide watch.""
   - Emotional indicators of hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair (""I wasn't made for life,"" ""I loathe myself,"" ""it's too painful"").
   - Specific mention of a method (""take a bunch of pills while everyone's asleep"").
   - No references to past attempts, but a clear expression of current distress and thoughts of ending life.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide watch,"" ""wish I could just fucking end it"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""subjectively it would be better if I was dead,"" ""wish I could just fucking end it"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""take a bunch of pills while everyone's asleep"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post mentions a method but expresses fear and hesitation, not active preparation or acquisition of means.
   - Since there is a specific method mentioned but no clear preparation, I will lean toward 'behavior' due to the explicit mention of a method, but I will double-check the definitions to confirm.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions and thoughts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond vague thoughts of not wanting to live by mentioning a specific method (""take a bunch of pills""), which aligns with 'behavior' as it includes a plan, even if briefly mentioned.
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - According to the definition of 'behavior,' a mention of a specific method qualifies as a plan, even if not fully acted upon or prepared. The hesitation (""too scared"") does not negate the explicit mention of a method, so I will classify this as 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide: The post mentions the user's friend potentially planning to commit suicide soon and also references the user's own past suicidal thoughts and a serious attempt in 2009.
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses concern for their friend, describes their friend's struggles with chronic depression, anxiety, and pain, and mentions their own past struggles with suicidal ideation due to Crohn's Disease, stress, anxiety, and depression.
   - Specific plans or methods: The post does not mention any specific methods or preparations for the user's friend or the user themselves currently. The user's past attempt is mentioned but not detailed with specific methods.
   - References to past attempts: The user explicitly mentions a serious suicide attempt in 2009 that almost succeeded.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, both for the friend (potential future intent) and for the user (past attempt and past ideation).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not currently for the user; the user states they are in a good place now and have not had suicidal ideation in months. The friend's intent is mentioned as a concern but not a direct quote or personal expression from the user.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This does not apply as the mentions are explicit but need to be contextualized for the user.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods or tools are mentioned for the friend or the user currently. The user's past attempt is referenced without details.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of current preparation for the user or detailed preparation for the friend.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No current planning is evident for the user, so this leans away from 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The user's mention of suicide refers to past ideation and a past attempt in 2009. There is no current expression of suicidal thoughts or plans by the user. The friend's potential suicide is a current/future concern but is not the user's personal risk.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The user's past attempt in 2009 is mentioned as ""very serious"" and ""almost succeeded,"" but no specific details (method or means) are provided.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - Important rule: The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned. Therefore, the friend's risk is irrelevant to the classification.
   - For the user: There is no current expression of suicidal thoughts or plans. The user states they are in a good place now and have not had ideation in months. However, there is a clear reference to a past suicide attempt in 2009.
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'Indicator' does not fit because there is explicit mention of suicide (past attempt).
     - 'Ideation' does not fit because there is no current expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die.
     - 'Behavior' does not fit because there is no current plan or preparation mentioned.
     - 'Attempt' fits because the post describes a past suicide attempt by the user. The definition states that 'attempt' focuses on historic actions, and even if current plans were mentioned (which they are not for the user), it would still be labeled as 'attempt' if a past attempt is referenced.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'attempt' due to the explicit mention of a past suicide attempt by the user.

Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of distress, fear about therapy not working, and general dissatisfaction with life (feeling afraid, upset, lazy, unmotivated, and ashamed).
   - There is a vague reference to suicidal thoughts with the phrase ""lol kermit sewer slide,"" which appears to be a slang or meme reference to suicide, and the mention of it being ""tempting a lot of the time.""
   - Emotional indicators include fear, shame, tiredness, and lack of motivation, pointing to hopelessness and despair.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned in a direct way; the phrase ""kermit sewer slide"" is a coded or indirect reference to suicide.
   - There is a vague expression of it being ""tempting,"" which could imply a desire to not be alive, but it is not a clear or direct statement of wanting to die.
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation are evident (e.g., no notes or acquiring means).
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and thoughts, with no mention of past events or future intentions regarding suicide.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains significant expressions of distress and hopelessness, but the reference to suicide is indirect and vague (""kermit sewer slide"" and ""tempting"").
   - As per the guidelines, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned, I should choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.'
   - There is no explicit desire to die or commit suicide stated directly, and no plans or methods are mentioned, further supporting 'indicator.'
   - The emotional content alone, without clear suicidal intent, fits the definition of 'indicator.'

But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide are explicit, with phrases like ""I want to kill myself so badly"" and ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train.""

   - Specific method mentioned: jumping in front of a train to be ""in pieces.""
   - No references to past attempts; the focus is on current feelings and thoughts.
   - There are mentions of ""end of life stuff"" like belongings and phone, which could imply vague preparation considerations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times with direct statements like ""I want to kill myself"" and ""if I did kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, very clear expressions such as ""I hate being alive"" and ""I wish I was never born.""
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, jumping in front of a train is explicitly stated as a desired method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a vague reference to ""end of life stuff"" like belongings and phone, but no concrete actions or specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means or writing a note) are described.
   - While a method is mentioned, the preparation is uncertain and not detailed. Per the rules, if unsure about explicit planning, lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings and hypothetical future actions (""if I did kill myself""), not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - A specific method (jumping in front of a train) is mentioned, which suggests possible 'behavior.' However, there is no clear evidence of concrete planning or preparation beyond vague references to ""end of life stuff."" Per the guidelines, if uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to explicit suicidal thoughts without definitive evidence of a specific, actionable plan or preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include a mention of ""slitting my wrists,"" which is a direct reference to self-harm and a potential method of suicide. 
   - Emotional indicators include ""mental breakdown,"" ""growing more depressed,"" and ""feeling more alone,"" which suggest despair and distress.
   - There is a specific method mentioned (slitting wrists), but no indication of active preparation or plans to carry it out (the user states ""I didn’t do it"").
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned by name, but there is a clear reference to self-harm with ""slitting my wrists,"" which implies a desire to harm oneself, potentially with fatal intent.
   - There is no direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive, but the mention of a specific self-harm method suggests suicidal ideation.
   - Since it is somewhat unclear whether this directly translates to a desire to die, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' if the intent is not explicit. However, the mention of a method pushes toward further evaluation.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""slitting my wrists""), which is a clear reference to a way of self-harm or suicide.
   - However, there are no signs of preparation or intent to act on this thought, as the user explicitly states ""I didn’t do it.""
   - Since there is no active plan or preparation mentioned, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a thought that occurred ""today,"" indicating current ideation rather than past events or future intentions.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains a specific reference to a method of self-harm (""slitting my wrists""), which suggests suicidal thoughts. However, there is no explicit plan or preparation to act on this thought, and the user states they did not do it.
   - While suicide is not directly mentioned, the reference to a method and the context of depression and loneliness suggest ideation rather than just a vague indicator.
   - Since there is no concrete plan or preparation, it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit thought of self-harm without a specific plan.

I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.

   - No specific method or means of suicide (e.g., tools, locations, substances) is mentioned in the post.
   - There is a sign of preparation through the mention of writing ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters,"" which are concrete actions taken in anticipation of ending their life.
   - While the preparation of notes is explicit, the lack of a specific method or plan for the act itself creates some uncertainty about whether this fully constitutes a detailed plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current or future intentions with ""I'm leaving soon,"" indicating an imminent plan rather than past events.
   - No past attempts are mentioned or described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of ""suicide notes"" and intent to die (""I'm leaving soon"") rules out 'indicator,' as this goes beyond vague distress or hopelessness.
   - The content clearly expresses suicidal thoughts, fitting the criteria for at least 'ideation.'
   - The mention of preparing ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"" suggests a form of planning or preparation, which leans toward 'behavior.' However, since no specific method or means of carrying out the act is mentioned, and the rule states to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when unsure about explicit planning, I must consider this carefully.
   - Given the rule to err on the side of 'ideation' over 'behavior' when a specific plan is not clear, and since the preparation mentioned is limited to writing notes rather than acquiring means or specifying a method, 'ideation' may be more appropriate. However, the preparation of suicide notes is a strong indicator of intent and action, so I lean toward 'behavior.'
   - No past attempts are mentioned, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Final consideration: The rule specifies that 'behavior' requires some form of explicit planning like a method or preparations. Writing suicide notes qualifies as preparation, and combined with the explicit intent, 'behavior' seems the best fit despite the lack of a specific method.

I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide explicitly, including a specific date (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"") and a timeframe (""either that day or before it"").
   - Emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and trauma (""10 yrs of the worst of this hell"", ""I TRUST NOT 1 SINGLE soul"", ""I'm fucking done"").
   - References to past attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts"") with an implication of not succeeding (""obv I wasn't trying hard enough"").
   - No specific method or means mentioned for the planned suicide, but a clear intent and timeline are provided.
   - Mentions of self-harm and suicidality (""how much I struggle with sh/suicidality"") and a desire for help but feeling abandoned by the system.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, very clearly (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, multiple times (""enough is enough"", ""before I end thing v v soon"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there is no mention of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to commit suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, though a specific date is set (""This Friday, May 14, 2021""). No mention of notes, acquiring means, or other concrete preparations.
   - Since there is no explicit method or preparation beyond a date, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline (""If unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. There are references to past attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts"") and current/future intentions with a specific date for suicide (""This Friday, May 14, 2021"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Not in detail; it’s a general statement about ""constant attempts"" without specifics of actions taken. However, per the definition of 'attempt', past attempts are mentioned, and the post also includes current plans.
   - As per the rule in the 'attempt' definition (""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'""), this could lean toward 'attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - There is a clear expression of suicidal intent with a specific date, but no specific method or preparation is mentioned, which suggests 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline to err on the side of 'ideation' when unsure about explicit planning.
   - However, the post also mentions past attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts""), and the definition of 'attempt' states that if a post refers to past attempts and mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt'.
   - Given the explicit rule in the 'attempt' definition, I must prioritize 'attempt' over 'ideation' or 'behavior' since past attempts are referenced alongside current plans, even though the past attempts are not described in detail.

47,"Pointlessness. I know someone's gonna hit me with ""well if everything's pointless, then it doesn't matter if nothing matters"". Which doesn't make things better. It doesn't make me want to go rogue and have fun with life because I've let everything go, and come what may until in my grave I lay. No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey. I don't want to look on the bright-side, to have confidence or assertiveness. I am bad at both those things. If I was good at them, I wouldn't want them. That's my point. If we have an option as humans to be any way we want, I vote we be no way at all. I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds. I am so sick of appearances. People care SO MUCH about how other people are. It's sickening. I should start being rude to people, in line with how I feel about us. I know there's a heaven and it distresses me. I want to disappear forever and I know God won't let that happen. I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit. What's difficult is the pain caused to people I care about and who care about me, but I don't really think it'll matter one way or the other. They'll suffer and that will be that, different and worse than had they not suffered, but just another experience at the end of the day.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or dying: Yes, the user states, ""I know I will die by 35"" and expresses a desire to ""disappear forever.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of hopelessness, pointlessness, and dissatisfaction with life. The user expresses frustration with societal expectations and a desire to not exist as they are.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods or plans for suicide are mentioned. The statement about dying by 35 is a prediction or belief, not a concrete plan with details of how it will happen.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or direct phrases like ""kill myself"" are not used. However, there is a clear expression of wanting to ""disappear forever"" and a belief in dying young.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user explicitly states a desire to ""disappear forever"" and predicts their death by age 35.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Although suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the desire to not exist is clear, which leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator' based on the definition of explicit thoughts of not wanting to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to end their life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since there is no specific plan or method mentioned, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and a future belief about dying by 35, but not a past event.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to not be alive (""disappear forever"") and a belief in dying young, which aligns with suicidal thoughts. However, there is no mention of a specific plan or method to commit suicide, ruling out 'behavior.' There are no references to past attempts, ruling out 'attempt.' While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the desire to not exist is clear, which fits the definition of 'ideation' (explicit thoughts of not wanting to live without a specific plan). Therefore, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category over 'indicator,' as the thoughts are explicit about not wanting to exist.

   - The post refers to current thoughts and potential future actions, not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - This post goes beyond general distress or vague thoughts (ruling out 'indicator').
   - It includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die (meeting criteria for at least 'ideation').

   - Since there is no mention of past attempts, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of methods and the focus on how to die effectively, 'behavior' seems the best fit over 'ideation,' as per the definition requiring some form of explicit planning or method.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions counting pills every night, which could imply a focus on a potential method for self-harm or suicide.
   - Expresses wondering why they didn’t “take them all,” which suggests thoughts of overdose or ending their life.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of being unloved and uncared for, as well as self-labeling as a “coward,” indicating despair and low self-worth.
   - No explicit mention of a specific plan or preparation beyond the act of counting pills.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by name, but there is an implied desire to end their life through the phrase “why I didn’t take them all.”
   - There is a direct expression of questioning why they haven’t acted on these thoughts, which leans toward a desire to not be alive.
   - Since it’s not entirely explicit (e.g., “I want to die” or “I want to kill myself”), I must consider if this falls under 'indicator' or 'ideation.' However, the context of pills and the implication of taking them all strongly suggests suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Pills are mentioned, which could be a method, but there is no specific plan described (e.g., acquiring extra pills, setting a time, or other preparations).
   - Counting pills could be seen as a behavior, but it’s not clear if this is preparation or just a repetitive thought/action without intent.
   - Since there’s no explicit planning or preparation beyond the mention of pills, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current, ongoing thoughts (“every night” and “every day”), not past events or future specific intentions.
   - No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains an implied desire to not be alive (“why I didn’t take them all”), which aligns with suicidal thoughts.
   - While pills are mentioned, there’s no concrete plan or preparation described, so it doesn’t fully meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - There’s no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Given the implied suicidal thoughts without an explicit plan, 'ideation' seems the best fit. However, I must ensure I’m not overclassifying. The rules state to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' if suicide isn’t explicitly mentioned. Since the word “suicide” or a direct statement like “I want to die” isn’t present, I must lean toward 'indicator,' but the context of pills and the phrasing strongly implies suicidal intent. Upon re-evaluation, the intensity of the implication pushes this toward 'ideation.'

   - Despite the strong implication, I must adhere to the rule that the mention of suicide needs to be very explicit to classify as 'ideation.' Phrases like ""I cant live anymore"" and ""a non painful way to do this"" are suggestive but not direct mentions of suicide or killing oneself.
   - There is no specific plan or method described, ruling out 'behavior.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, ruling out 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, based on the rule to lean toward 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mention, the best fit is 'indicator.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to ""kill myself"" and a specific time frame (""next week""). 
   - There is a direct reference to a method (""with drugs"") and preparation (""write a suicide note for my family"").
   - Emotional indicators include a sense of resignation or justification (""I hope they understand me"") and concern about family reaction (""my family is upset at first"").
   - No mention of past attempts, only future intent.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""I want to kill myself"").
   - Direct expression of wanting to die: Yes (""I want to kill myself next week"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific method mentioned: Yes (""with drugs"").
   - Signs of preparation: Yes (""write a suicide note for my family"").
   - The plan and preparation are clear, not vague.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to future intentions (""next week""), not past events.
   - No past attempts described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It also includes a specific plan (""with drugs"") and preparation (""suicide note""), which goes beyond mere ideation.
   - Since there is no mention of past attempts, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of a method and preparation, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include tiredness, loneliness, hopelessness, lack of motivation, jealousy, and regret.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon"" is vague and could imply a desire to end things, it does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die.
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or methods, 'behavior' is not applicable. If there were any doubt, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it’s not relevant.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings and struggles, with a vague future reference (""ready to get this over with soon"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and loneliness, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. The vague statement ""i'm ready to get this over with soon"" does not meet the threshold for explicit suicidal ideation as per the guidelines. There are no plans, methods, or past attempts mentioned. Therefore, following the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, this post fits the 'indicator' category.

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of self-harm through overdose (""I have overdosed"").
   - Emotional indicators of regret and suffering (""I regret everything"", ""I just want my suffering to be over"").
   - Specific method and dosage mentioned (""I took 500mg Zoloft"").
   - Ambivalence about death (""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over"").
   - No explicit mention of wanting to die by suicide, but a clear act of self-harm with intent to ""punish"" oneself.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or direct intent to die is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user explicitly says, ""I don't want to die,"" though they express a desire for suffering to end.
   - Since it's unclear and suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' based on the rule. However, the act of overdosing complicates this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user mentions overdosing with ""500mg Zoloft.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act has already been carried out as per the post (""I have overdosed"").
   - Since there is a clear method and action taken, this leans toward 'behavior' despite the lack of explicit suicidal intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The overdose is described as a current or very recent event (""I have overdosed"", ""It hasn't been that long"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, this appears to be a current action, not a past attempt.
   - Since it’s current and involves a specific act, it aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die, which per the rules would lean toward 'indicator'. However, the explicit mention of overdosing with a specific dosage (""500mg Zoloft"") and the act being carried out indicates a form of self-harming behavior with potential risk.
   - Per the definitions, 'behavior' requires explicit suicidal thoughts alongside a plan or method. Here, while the method is clear, the suicidal intent is ambiguous (""I don't want to die"").
   - 'Ideation' requires explicit expressions of wanting to die, which are not present.
   - 'Attempt' applies to past actions, and this seems current.
   - Given the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure about explicit planning, and 'indicator' over 'ideation' if unsure about suicidal intent, I must weigh the act of overdosing. However, since the user explicitly denies wanting to die, and suicide is not mentioned, the strict rule of needing explicit suicidal intent pushes this toward 'indicator', though this feels counterintuitive given the self-harm.
   - Reassessing the rules: ""Behavior"" includes self-harming behavior with a method, even if suicidal intent is not fully clear. Since overdosing is a concrete act with a specific method, 'behavior' seems most appropriate despite the user's statement of not wanting to die.
   - Final decision: Given the explicit act of self-harm with a method (overdose), I classify this as 'behavior', acknowledging the tension with the lack of explicit suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include phrases like ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""I'm going to,"" and ""I'm ready to go,"" which strongly suggest an intention to end their life. 
   - Emotional indicators show a sense of peace and readiness, which can be associated with a decision to act on suicidal thoughts.
   - There is no mention of specific plans, methods, or preparations (e.g., tools, locations, or notes).
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by name, but the phrases ""I'm doing it"" and ""I'm ready to go"" in this context strongly imply a desire to die or end their life. Given the tone and context, this leans toward explicit intent. Since it's not entirely clear, I will lean toward 'indicator' if there’s doubt, but the intent feels clear here.
   - Direct expression of wanting to die is implied through ""I'm ready to go"" and ""I'm doing it in the near future.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes or acquiring means) are described.
   - Since there’s no explicit planning, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to future intentions (""in the near future""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are mentioned.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an implied but strong expression of wanting to die or end their life, which fits the definition of 'ideation' since suicide or death is heavily implied even if not explicitly stated.
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Although suicide is not explicitly mentioned by name, the context and phrasing make the intent clear, so I will classify it as 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of being ""suicidal"" in the past, as the user states their high school found out they were suicidal.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration or anger toward the high school counselor and principal, but no current expressions of hopelessness or despair.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - There is a reference to a past event (being suicidal 4 years ago), but no description of a specific past attempt or action taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user mentions being ""suicidal"" in the past.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post does not express a current desire to die or not be alive; it only references a past state of being suicidal.
   - Since the mention is explicit but tied to the past with no current intent, I will consider the context further before deciding.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances related to suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - Since there is no planning or preparation mentioned, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a past event (4 years ago) when the user was identified as suicidal by their high school.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the post does not describe a concrete action or attempt; it only states they were ""suicidal"" at that time.
   - Since there is no description of a specific past attempt, 'attempt' may not apply.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions being ""suicidal,"" which goes beyond vague distress or sadness, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - However, the mention is tied to a past event with no current expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die, and no specific plans or methods are mentioned, so 'ideation' needs to be considered carefully.
   - There is no mention of a specific past attempt or concrete action, so 'attempt' does not seem to fit.
   - There is no mention of a plan or preparation, so 'behavior' is not applicable.
   - Given the explicit mention of being suicidal (even in the past) and the rule to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' if unclear, I note that the mention of ""suicidal"" is explicit. However, since there is no current intent or desire expressed, and the focus is on a past event without a described attempt, I lean toward 'ideation' for the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts in the user's history.
   - After reconsideration, the definition of 'ideation' specifies current thoughts or feelings of not wanting to be alive. Since this post only reflects on a past state without current intent, and considering the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt, 'indicator' may be more appropriate.
   - Final decision: Since the post does not express current suicidal thoughts and only mentions a past state of being suicidal without detail, and given the rule to err on the side of 'indicator' when unclear, I will classify this as 'indicator.'

   - Since there is mention of preparation but no explicit method or specific plan, I must lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rule: ""If unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current thoughts and intentions (""i should die"") and a decision made a few days ago to kill themselves, indicating current or recent ideation and preparation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

I hope they enjoy my stuff, cuz they never seemed to enjoy my company.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or dying: The post talks about ""vanishing without a trace"" and finding a ""secluded spot where no one will find my body,"" which strongly implies an intention to die.
   - Emotional indicators: There is a sense of hopelessness and despair, as the person feels they have ""nothing to look forward to"" and believes their roommates do not enjoy their company.
   - Specific plans or methods: The post details a plan to empty their bank account, leave belongings, walk to a secluded spot, and mentions carrying a pistol, which is a specific tool that could be used for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: There are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not directly used, but the intent to die is heavily implied through phrases like ""vanish without a trace"" and finding a place where their body won’t be found.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the implication of wanting to disappear and die is clear from the context, even if not explicitly stated as ""I want to die.""
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Although the word ""suicide"" isn’t used, the intent is strongly implied, so this leans toward 'ideation' or beyond.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post mentions carrying a pistol, which is a clear tool that could be used for suicide, and finding a secluded spot to avoid being found.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, there are detailed preparations mentioned, such as emptying a bank account, leaving belongings, and planning to walk with minimal items (cash, shoes, pistol, canteen).
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The planning here is explicit and detailed, so this leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to future intentions (""when that happens,"" ""eventually""), not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not fit 'indicator' because there are clear implications of wanting to die, even if the word ""suicide"" isn’t used.
   - It could fit 'ideation' due to the expressed desire to ""vanish"" and not be found, implying death, but the presence of a detailed plan pushes it beyond mere thoughts.
   - It fits 'behavior' because there are explicit suicidal thoughts (implied intent to die) combined with a specific plan (carrying a pistol, finding a secluded spot, preparations like emptying bank account and leaving belongings).
   - It does not fit 'attempt' because there is no mention of past actions or attempts, only future intentions.
   - Given the detailed plan and specific method (pistol), the best category is 'behavior.'

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this moves beyond 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not fully; while a location (woodland) is specified and notes to warn others are planned, no explicit method (e.g., rope, overdose) is described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, to some extent, with the planning of a location and notes to warn dog walkers and call the police.
   - Since there is some planning (location and notes) but no specific method or tool mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior,' but I must consider if the planning is explicit enough. As per the rule, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily focuses on current feelings and future intentions (planning a location and notes), with some reference to past self-harm but no specific past suicide attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past self-harm is mentioned, not a concrete suicide attempt.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a desire to not exist, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There is some planning (location and notes), which initially suggests 'behavior.' However, the planning lacks a specific method or tool, and the rule states to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure about explicit planning.
   - No past suicide attempts are described, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit suicidal thoughts but uncertainty about the specificity of the plan (no method mentioned), I lean toward 'ideation' as per the guideline to err on the side of caution when planning is not fully explicit.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore . I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of being suicidal (""told it was 'a bit silly' to be suicidal at my age"") and a reference to ending things (""tonight's the night I guess"").

   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal at my age"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""tonight's the night I guess"", ""no one will miss me when I'm gone"").
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned and there is a desire to not be alive, this leans toward at least 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and a potential future action (""tonight's the night"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.
   - The focus is on current emotional state and a vague future implication, not a past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions being suicidal and expresses a desire to not be alive (""tonight's the night""), which rules out 'indicator'.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not fit 'behavior'.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of self-harm through ""cutting an artery"" and use of ""oxy"" (likely referring to oxycodone, a painkiller).
   - Emotional indicators are minimal, with an apology suggesting some distress or uncertainty (""im sorry if this isn't allowed here"").
   - Specific methods are mentioned: cutting an artery and taking oxy to lessen pain, which implies a method of self-harm or suicide.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (no direct reference to wanting to die or commit suicide).
   - There is no direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive, though the actions described (cutting an artery) strongly imply a life-threatening intent.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the rule. However, the specific method mentioned pushes toward further evaluation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are mentioned: cutting an artery and using oxy to lessen pain, which suggests a detailed approach to self-harm or potential suicide.
   - There are no explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), but the detailed description of the method (cutting an artery with pain reduction via oxy) indicates a level of planning.
   - Given the mention of a specific method, this leans toward 'behavior' over 'ideation', but I must consider the lack of explicit suicidal intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post does not refer to past events or attempts; it appears to be a current hypothetical or exploratory question (""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain"").
   - No past attempts are described, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die, which aligns with 'indicator' per the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit mentions.
   - However, the mention of a specific method (cutting an artery) and a way to manage pain (oxy) strongly suggests a plan or intent, which aligns with 'behavior'.
   - The rule states to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure about explicit planning, but the detailed method description seems to meet the criteria for 'behavior' (specific method mentioned).
   - Given the lack of explicit suicidal intent or desire to die, I must adhere to the rule of prioritizing 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, but the specific life-threatening method pushes me toward 'behavior'.
   - Final consideration: The definition of 'behavior' requires explicit suicidal thoughts alongside a plan. Since suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated (only implied by the method), I must lean toward 'ideation' if I move past 'indicator'. However, the rule is clear—without explicit mention of suicide, it should be 'indicator'. Yet, the specificity of the method cannot be ignored, and 'behavior' seems more fitting based on the content.

   After careful review of the rules, I note that 'behavior' requires both explicit suicidal thoughts and a plan. Since explicit suicidal thoughts are absent (no direct statement of wanting to die), I must classify this as 'ideation' at most. However, the primary rule of choosing 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned takes precedence.
   Correction: Upon re-reading the definitions, 'ideation' also requires explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive. Since this post lacks that explicitness, it must be 'indicator' despite the method mentioned, as per the strict rule on explicitness.
   Final decision: The rule is clear—without explicit mention of suicide or desire to die, it is 'indicator'.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide are present, but they are attributed to a friend's statements (""she thinks I'm going to die,"" ""she's positive I'm going to kill myself""). There is no direct expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings from the person writing the post.
   - Emotional indicators include hurt, distress, and frustration over the friend's comments, as well as struggles with mental illness (BPD and CPTSD). However, these emotions are related to the friend's words rather than an expression of personal suicidal intent.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned by the poster.
   - No references to past attempts by the poster are included.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned, but only in the context of what the friend said (""she's positive I'm going to kill myself""). There is no personal expression of wanting to die or not be alive from the poster.
   - Since the mention of suicide is not a direct expression from the poster, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned by the poster regarding suicide.
   - No signs of preparation are indicated.
   - Since there is no planning or behavior mentioned by the poster, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a past conversation with a friend and current feelings of hurt, but there are no references to past suicide attempts or current/future intentions by the poster.
   - No past attempts are described by the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does mention suicide explicitly, but it is not an expression of the poster's own thoughts or desires. The guidelines state that the suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not others mentioned. There is no personal expression of wanting to die, no plans, and no past attempts described by the poster. The emotional distress is focused on the friend's hurtful comments rather than personal suicidal ideation. Additionally, the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned as a personal intent. Since the mention is not from the poster’s perspective, 'indicator' seems most appropriate.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include the user being at their window with scissors, expressing a feeling of being about to ""cut the screen and jump out."" There is a clear implication of self-harm or suicidal intent through jumping.
   - Emotional indicators include desperation and confusion (""please help,"" ""I don’t know what to do"").
   - Specific plan or method is mentioned: using scissors to cut the screen and jumping out of the window.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used), but there is a clear expression of intent to jump out of the window, which implies a desire to end their life or cause serious harm.
   - Direct expression of wanting to die is not explicitly stated, but the action of jumping strongly suggests it. Given the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I note the lack of explicit wording but recognize the strong implication.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific method is mentioned: cutting the screen with scissors and jumping out of the window.
   - Signs of preparation are present: the user is currently at the window with scissors, indicating immediate intent and means.
   - This is not uncertain; there is a clear plan and action being described.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions (""im at my window right now,"" ""im about to cut the screen and jump out"").
   - No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Although suicide is not explicitly mentioned by name, the post contains a clear and immediate plan to jump out of a window after cutting the screen with scissors, which indicates a specific method and preparation. This goes beyond vague thoughts or general distress.
   - Given the explicit mention of a method (scissors, jumping) and the current nature of the threat, this fits the 'behavior' category as it includes both suicidal intent (implied through action) and a specific plan.
   - The rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure does not apply here, as the plan is explicit.
   - This is not an 'attempt' as there is no mention of past actions, only current intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a mention of overdosing on iron pills, daily pain, and not wanting to deal with it, along with an apology.
   - Emotional indicators: Expression of pain and a desire to escape it.
   - Specific plan: Mention of overdosing on iron pills as a method.
   - No reference to past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned, but there is a clear intent to harm oneself through overdosing.
   - Direct expression of not wanting to deal with pain, which implies a desire to escape life.
   - Since it's not explicitly ""suicide"" but the intent is clear, I lean toward a higher category than 'indicator'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific method mentioned: overdosing on iron pills.
   - No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring pills or writing a note) beyond stating the method.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current or future intentions (gonna overdose), not past events.
   - No mention of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post does not fit 'indicator' because there is a clear intent to harm oneself with a method mentioned.
   - It exceeds 'ideation' because a specific method (overdosing on iron pills) is stated, which aligns with planning.
   - It fits 'behavior' due to the explicit mention of a method, even if preparation details are absent.
   - It does not fit 'attempt' as there is no reference to past actions.
   - Following the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure, I still believe 'behavior' is appropriate due to the clear mention of a method.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of concrete steps like acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or specific method, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

   - There are direct expressions of not wanting to be here and not being able to do it anymore, which suggest a desire to not be alive.
   - No specific mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm methods or plans are present.
   - No references to past attempts at suicide or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion from trying to cope.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or direct terms like ""kill myself"" are not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here"" and ""I don't think I can do it anymore"" indicate a desire to not be alive.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned but there is a clear expression of not wanting to live, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'indicator' based on the definition of ideation including explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any specific ways to end life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or mention of methods, 'behavior' is not applicable, and I will stay with 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post reflects current feelings and intentions, with phrases like ""I don't think I can do it anymore"" indicating present distress.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past suicide attempts.
   - The focus is on current emotional state, not past actions, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide, but it does express a clear desire to not be alive (""I just don't wanna be here""). Per the definition of 'ideation', this qualifies as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings without a specific plan.
   - There is no mention of a plan or method, so 'behavior' does not apply.
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - While the lack of the word ""suicide"" might suggest 'indicator', the explicit expression of not wanting to be here aligns more closely with 'ideation' as per the guidelines. The rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit mention of suicide is noted, but the clarity of the desire to not be alive tips the balance toward 'ideation'.

78,"I really, really wish lives were donate-able. Today, I met a guy on the internet of the same age as me. I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago, he lost his mother to cancer, got bullied, got kicked out of school because of a false accusation which stated that he was planning a rebellion and how they were making a very small amount of money. The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of wishing to ""donate"" their life to someone else, implying a desire to not live or to give up their own life.
   - Emotional indicators include despair and a sense of unworthiness (""I don't deserve, nor want to live"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts by the poster (only a mention of another person's past suicidal state).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (the term ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself"" is not used).
   - There is a direct expression of not wanting to live (""I don't deserve, nor want to live"") and wishing to donate their life, which implies a desire to not be alive.
   - Since the mention of suicide is not very explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and desires (wishing to donate life now).
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts by the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses a desire to not live and a wish to ""donate"" their life, which could suggest suicidal ideation. However, the guideline emphasizes that the mention of suicide must be very explicit to move beyond 'indicator'. The language here is more metaphorical (""donate my life"") and does not directly state intent to die by suicide.
   - There is no explicit plan or method, so 'behavior' is not applicable.
   - There are no past attempts mentioned by the poster, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Given the rule to lean toward 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, this post fits best under 'indicator' due to the lack of direct reference to suicide or killing oneself, despite the strong emotional distress and implied desire to not live.

I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds. I'm quitting therapy. Talk about a waste of time and energy. Fuck weight loss. Soda and junk will kill me faster. Hope it all ends soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death: ""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" and references to actions that could hasten death like stopping meds and hoping to get COVID.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness and frustration (""tired of it,"" ""healing is a fucking joke,"" ""family is a fucking joke,"" ""waste of time and energy"").
   - Specific plans or methods: Stopping medications (antidepressants, anti-anxiety, blood pressure meds), quitting therapy, and consuming soda and junk food to ""kill me faster."" However, these actions are not explicit methods or tools directly linked to suicide (e.g., no mention of weapons, locations, or overdose plans).
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon"" clearly express a desire to not be alive.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned but there is a clear desire to die, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'indicator' based on the definition of ideation including explicit expressions of not wanting to live.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not in the traditional sense of suicide methods (e.g., no mention of tools, weapons, or specific locations). Stopping meds and eating junk food are mentioned as ways to ""kill me faster,"" but these are not concrete or immediate plans for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Stopping meds and quitting therapy are actions being taken, but they are not direct preparations for suicide (e.g., no suicide note or acquiring lethal means).
   - Since there is no explicit or specific plan for suicide, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I'm ready to die,"" ""I'm stopping all my meds today,"" ""Hope it all ends soon"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon""), which aligns with the definition of 'ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings without a specific plan.
   - Although there are actions mentioned (stopping meds, eating junk food), these do not constitute a specific plan or method for suicide as defined in 'behavior' (e.g., no tools, locations, or direct means).
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - While suicide is not explicitly mentioned by name, the desire to not be alive is clear, so it does not fit 'indicator,' which requires no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation.'

   - Key elements in the post include a desire to ""disappear"" and a wish for the ""broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain.""
   - There are emotional indicators of distress and pain, with a sense of hopelessness implied.
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm are present.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. (No)
   - There is a vague expression of wanting to ""disappear"" and be ""free from pain,"" but no direct statement of wanting to die or not be alive. (No)
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned. (No)
   - No signs of preparation are evident. (No)
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'ideation' would be considered over 'behavior,' but given the lack of explicit suicidal intent, this step may not fully apply.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post appears to reflect current feelings or desires, not past events or future intentions.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post lacks explicit mention of suicide or a clear desire to die. The expressions of wanting to ""disappear"" and be ""free from pain"" are vague and do not directly indicate suicidal thoughts. There is significant distress and hopelessness, but per the guidelines, this still falls under 'indicator' since suicide or killing oneself is not explicitly mentioned. There is no plan or past attempt described, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable. When in doubt, the rule is to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation,' which applies here.

   - Since there is no explicit planning or specific method, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current thoughts or intentions (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" and needing a plan), not past events.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

   - While there is a mention of needing a plan, there are no specific details or preparations mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or harm oneself.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - The finger gun gesture is symbolic and not a concrete preparation or plan.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or preparation for a current act, this leans away from 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to both current thoughts (""I'm going to kill myself"") and a past attempt (""relating to my most recent failed attempt"").
   - The past attempt is specifically mentioned, which aligns with the 'attempt' category.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of suicide and desire to die rules out 'indicator.'
   - The lack of a specific current plan or method for suicide rules out 'behavior.'
   - The mention of a past failed attempt aligns with the 'attempt' category, and per the rules, even if current thoughts are mentioned, the presence of a past attempt classifies it as 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'attempt' due to the reference to a specific past action.

The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of preparations such as notes or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable, as there is no planning mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post reflects current feelings of hopelessness and a passive acceptance of death, with no reference to past attempts or future plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains significant emotional distress and hopelessness, with vague references to death and not wanting to ""try anymore."" However, there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to commit suicide. The user also states they do not intend to ""deliberately make it happen,"" which further distances the content from active suicidal ideation. Per the guideline to lean toward 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, this post fits the 'indicator' category. It does not meet the threshold for 'ideation' as there is no clear expression of wanting to die or commit suicide, nor does it meet 'behavior' or 'attempt' due to the absence of plans or past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include an explicit mention of planning to ""kill myself tonight,"" indicating suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include a sense of isolation (""everyone is asleep,"" ""everyone who could help me is asleep"") and resignation (""this is my problem, my illness, it's on me"").
   - There is a specific temporal reference to ""tonight,"" suggesting an imminent plan.
   - No specific methods or tools are mentioned (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, or locations).
   - No reference to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned with the phrase ""kill myself tonight."" (Yes)
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die with the plan to act on it ""tonight."" (Yes)

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, or locations are mentioned for carrying out the act.
   - No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note or acquiring means) are described in the post.
   - Since there is no mention of a specific plan or method, this leans away from 'behavior' and toward 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a current intention (""tonight""), not past events or future vague thoughts.
   - There is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent with the phrase ""kill myself tonight,"" which rules out 'indicator.'
   - While there is a clear desire to die and a time frame (""tonight""), there is no mention of a specific method, location, or preparation, which suggests it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - As per the guidelines, if unsure about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions feeling like ""trash,"" not wanting to exist, and lacking purpose in life.
   - Emotional indicators include despair, anxiety attacks, and feeling like a disappointment.
   - Explicitly states ""I'm not suicidal or something"" and views suicide as selfish.
   - No mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but in a negative context (""I'm not suicidal,"" ""suicide is selfish"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the statement ""I just don't want to exist,"" which indicates a desire to not be alive, though it is somewhat vague and contradicted by the denial of being suicidal.
   - Since there is some ambiguity due to the denial of suicidal thoughts, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, no notes or acquiring means are mentioned.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains emotional distress and a vague expression of not wanting to exist, but the user explicitly denies being suicidal and views suicide negatively. As per the guideline, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned or intended, I should choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.' The mention of not wanting to exist could suggest ideation, but the explicit denial of suicidal thoughts and lack of clear intent to die tips the balance toward 'indicator.' There is no plan or past attempt mentioned, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide are explicit, with phrases like ""I dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""taking my life,"" and ""I want to take my life.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, worthlessness, despair, and a sense of powerlessness, as seen in statements like ""I feel like I am just living for someone else's benefit"" and ""this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness.""
   - Specific plans or methods for suicide are not mentioned; the post focuses on the concept of ""taking my life"" without detailing how it would be done.
   - There is a clear reference to a past suicide attempt, as the user states, ""I attempted suicide last week"" and describes the context around it (e.g., drafting a note but not leaving it, the attempt failing).
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct references to ""taking my life"" and being ""suicidal.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I dont know what I truly want besides death"" and ""I want to take my life.""
   
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to commit suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, beyond the mention of drafting a note in the past (related to the past attempt), there are no current preparations described.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method for a current or future act, this leans away from 'behavior.'
   
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post includes both a past suicide attempt (""I attempted suicide last week"") and current thoughts of wanting to die or take their life.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user explicitly mentions a recent failed attempt and provides details about their thought process (e.g., drafting a note, deciding not to leave it).
   
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There are no specific plans or methods mentioned for a current or future act, so it does not fully align with 'behavior.'
   - The explicit mention of a past suicide attempt (""I attempted suicide last week"") aligns with the 'attempt' category. Per the rules, even though there are current suicidal thoughts, the presence of a past attempt means the post should be classified as 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'attempt' since it focuses on historic actions, and the rule states to label it as 'attempt' when a past attempt is mentioned alongside current thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a direct question about the lethal dosage of Valium, a medication, and a statement of fear about not having taken enough. There is also an emotional indicator with the desire for ""this nightmare to end,"" which suggests hopelessness or despair.
   - Mentions of death or suicide are implied through the question about a lethal dose and the desire for the nightmare to end.
   - There is a specific mention of a method (Valium) and a possible implication of current or recent action (""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"").
   - No explicit reference to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned by name, but there is a clear implication of wanting to die through the question about a lethal dose of Valium and the desire to end the nightmare.
   - There is a direct expression of wanting the suffering to end, which in context strongly suggests a desire to not be alive. Given the ambiguity of explicit mention, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' if it remains unclear, but the context pushes toward ideation or beyond.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: Valium, with a focus on the dosage needed to kill.
   - There is a potential sign of preparation or action, as the user expresses concern about not having taken enough, implying they may have already taken some or are planning to.
   - Given the mention of a specific method and possible action, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current intentions or actions (""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough""), not past events.
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - While suicide is not explicitly named, the context of asking about a lethal dose of Valium and expressing fear of not having taken enough strongly suggests suicidal intent.
   - The mention of a specific method (Valium) and the implication of possible action or preparation (concern about dosage) pushes this beyond mere ideation into behavior.
   - Since there is no reference to past attempts, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the specific method and implied action, 'behavior' fits best. If there were no method mentioned, it would be 'ideation', and if suicide weren’t implied at all, it would be 'indicator'. However, the clear implication and specificity point to 'behavior'.

I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts (""I don't want to live at all"") which qualifies it beyond 'indicator.'
   - It does not mention any current specific plans or methods for suicide, so it does not fully align with 'behavior' for current risk.

I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying. I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide: The post explicitly asks, ""Tell me why I shouldn't kill myself,"" and describes a near-attempt with a belt around the neck.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme distress, hopelessness, and despair are evident through phrases like ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm fucking everything up,"" and ""I just need someone to push me one more inch.""
   - Specific plans or methods: The post describes using a belt around the neck against a doorknob in the closet as a method of suicide, including the act of nearly passing out before stopping.
   - References to past attempts: The described incident with the belt appears to be a very recent or near-attempt, stopped just before completion, but it is not clearly a past completed attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the direct question ""Tell me why I shouldn't kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I'm ready to be done"" and asking for reasons to be pushed to do it.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post describes using a belt around the neck against a doorknob as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the individual physically set up the belt and attempted the act, stopping just before passing out.
   - Since there is explicit planning and a specific method described, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The incident with the belt seems to be a very recent event (tonight), and the post expresses current suicidal thoughts and a desire to be pushed to complete the act, indicating ongoing risk.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The belt incident is described as something that happened tonight but was stopped before completion. It does not fully qualify as a completed past attempt since the action was interrupted, but it is very close to one.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond mere thoughts or ideation because a specific method (belt around neck) and preparation (setting it up against the doorknob) are described, which aligns with 'behavior.'
   - While the belt incident could be seen as a near-attempt, the category 'attempt' is reserved for clearly completed past actions. Since the action was stopped before completion and the post focuses on current intentions (""I'm so close to just doing it""), 'behavior' seems more appropriate than 'attempt.' Additionally, per the rules, if a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans, it should still be labeled as 'attempt,' but here the incident does not fully qualify as a completed attempt.
   - Given the explicit planning and method, and the current intent, 'behavior' is the best fit.

   - No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""too tired of life"" implies a desire to not continue living).
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans away from 'indicator'.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.

A few moments of happiness here and there? 12 years of required schooling only to be condemned to work the rest of our miserable lives most the time for paychecks barely enough to survive. This isn't fucking living. We are rotting away and people are acting indifferent to these facts. They consume the news and stuff of the media making themselves ignorant to the basic fact that human life has no fucking purpose other than living as a slave to make the rich richer and to slowly decay. We start dying the second we are born. This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good. So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or dying: Yes, with phrases like ""we start dying the second we are born"" and a vague intent to ""end this bullshit for good.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and frustration with life (""this isn't fucking living,"" ""human life has no fucking purpose,"" ""rotting away"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: There is a mention of a ""trip in April to end this bullshit for good,"" which suggests a future intention, though the method or location is not explicitly detailed.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not directly mention ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself."" However, the phrase ""end this bullshit for good"" strongly implies a desire to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the intent to ""end this bullshit for good"" suggests a desire to not be alive, though it is not explicitly stated as suicide.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the implication of ending life is strong. However, per the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I will carefully consider this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, substances, or locations are mentioned. The ""trip in April"" is vague and lacks detail on how the person intends to ""end this bullshit.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No concrete preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned, only a future timeframe (""April"").
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since the plan is vague and lacks specificity, I will lean toward 'ideation' if suicidal intent is confirmed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to future intentions with the mention of a trip in April to ""end this bullshit.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide, which per the rules suggests leaning toward 'indicator.' However, the strong implication of wanting to end life (""end this bullshit for good"") combined with a future timeframe (""trip in April"") suggests suicidal ideation.
   - It does not meet the criteria for 'behavior' because there is no specific method or detailed plan mentioned, only a vague reference to a trip.
   - It does not qualify as 'attempt' since there is no mention of past actions.
   - Given the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I must weigh this carefully. However, the clear intent to end life, even without the word ""suicide,"" aligns more with 'ideation' as it expresses a desire to not be alive.
   - Final reasoning: Since the post implies a desire to end life but lacks explicit mention of suicide, I will follow the guideline to prioritize 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicitness. The rule states that the mention of suicide must be very explicit to move beyond 'indicator,' and here it is implied rather than stated.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or dying: The user states ""I don’t think I want to die,"" which implies thoughts about death or suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Feelings of being a burden, uncertainty about wanting to die, and distress (stomach pain, sweating, shaking).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user explicitly mentions taking 44 paracetamol tablets almost an hour ago, which is a clear method and action of overdose.
   - References to past attempts: There is no mention of past attempts, only the current incident.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the user refers to not wanting to die in the context of an overdose.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly; the user says ""I don’t think I want to die,"" which suggests ambivalence rather than a clear desire to die. However, the act of taking an overdose implies intent at the time of action. Since it’s not a clear statement of wanting to die, I lean toward caution as per the rules.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user mentions taking 44 paracetamol tablets, which is a specific method of overdose.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the action has already been taken (ingesting the tablets), which indicates preparation and execution of a plan.
   - Since there is clear evidence of a method and action, this leans toward 'behavior' or 'attempt.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a very recent event (almost an hour ago), which is essentially current. It is not a historical attempt but an ongoing situation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts, only the current overdose.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - Indicator: This does not fit as there is a clear action (overdose) and implied thoughts about death, going beyond vague distress or sadness.
   - Ideation: This does not fit because there is a specific method and action (taking 44 paracetamol tablets), which goes beyond mere thoughts or desires to die.
   - Behavior: This could fit because there is an explicit action (overdose) with a specific method (paracetamol), indicating a plan or behavior. However, the action has already been taken, which might push it toward 'attempt.'
   - Attempt: This fits best because the user describes a concrete action (taking 44 paracetamol tablets) that has already occurred, even if very recently. The definition of 'attempt' includes past actions, and while this is very recent, it is a completed act rather than a current plan. Additionally, the rule states that if a post refers to past attempts (even recent) and/or current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Final note: As per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts (even if recent) and there is a concrete action, 'attempt' is the appropriate category. The user has taken a specific action (overdose), which aligns with a suicide attempt rather than just planning or ideation.

   - Suicide is explicitly implied through the phrase ""ending it soon."" (Yes)
   - There is a direct expression of not knowing what else to do, which aligns with wanting to end their life. (Yes)
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""overdosing on ibuprofen."" 
   - There are no clear signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), only a stated ""go-to plan"" with uncertainty about timing and effectiveness.
   - Since there is a specific method mentioned, even without concrete preparation, this leans toward a plan.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current or future intentions (""soon,"" ""tonight or this week""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""ending it soon"") and mentions a specific method (""overdosing on ibuprofen""), which aligns with the definition of 'behavior' as it includes a plan, even if vague on timing and execution. 
   - It does not fit 'indicator' due to explicit suicidal language, nor 'ideation' due to the mention of a specific method, and it is not 'attempt' as there is no reference to past actions.
   - Given the explicit mention of a method, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category over 'ideation.'

109,I Relapsed After Almost Two Years. I don't want to get into details but I think I have an addiction to extreme pornography and have had it since I was a kid. Last night/this morning I relapsed and now I feel like shit. If I had a gun I'd kill myself because I know how this goes for me and right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future. I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a relapse into addiction (extreme pornography), feelings of shame or distress (""feel like shit""), and a conditional statement about suicide (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself""). There are emotional indicators of despair and self-loathing (""some people are born/meant to be fucked up"").
   - There is a direct mention of killing oneself, tied to a hypothetical scenario involving a gun.
   - No specific plans or preparations for suicide are mentioned beyond the conditional statement. No past attempts are referenced.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"").
   - Yes, there is a direct expression of wanting to die, though it is framed conditionally.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned (a gun), but it is hypothetical (""If I had a gun"") rather than indicative of actual possession or preparation.
   - There are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes, or identifying locations).
   - Since the method is mentioned hypothetically and there is no evidence of concrete planning, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and a hypothetical future action (""I'd kill myself""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit mention of suicide and a desire to die, which rules out 'indicator'.
   - The mention of a method (gun) is hypothetical and lacks any indication of a specific plan or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation', as it reflects explicit suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan.

Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of suicide and a suicide plan.
   - Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness (""worthless existence,"" ""these past years have been shit"").
   - Specific mention of a plan to kill oneself and a timeline (""next week"").
   - No references to past attempts, only current intentions.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""I've got a suicide plan,"" ""how I can kill myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes (""excited to finally move on from this worthless existence"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Signs of preparation are implied but not explicitly detailed (no mention of notes or acquiring means).
   - Since a plan is mentioned, even without specific details, it leans toward 'behavior' as per the definition.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""next week""), not past events.
   - No past attempts described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere thoughts or ideation due to the mention of a specific plan and timeline, fitting the 'behavior' category.
   - Since specific methods or tools are not mentioned, there is a slight uncertainty, but the definition of 'behavior' includes even brief mentions of a plan, so 'behavior' is appropriate over 'ideation'.
   - No past attempts are mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicidal thoughts: The post explicitly states a history of suicidal thoughts and a return of those thoughts this year.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of feeling bad, depression, physical and mental pain, and guilt about seeking help outside the marriage.
   - Specific plans or methods: No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, the post mentions a past suicide attempt many years ago.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post mentions suicidal thoughts and a past attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, there is a mention of having suicidal thoughts again this year.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Not applicable, as suicide is explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances related to a current plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of current preparations such as notes or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable, as there is no mention of a current plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to both a past attempt (many years ago) and current suicidal thoughts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a past attempt is mentioned, though not in detail.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific current plan or method for suicide, ruling out 'behavior'.
   - The post mentions a past suicide attempt and current suicidal thoughts. According to the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current thoughts, it should still be classified as 'attempt' since the definition prioritizes historic actions even with current ideation.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'attempt' due to the explicit reference to a past suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of self-harm (thoughts of ""sh"" and inability to ""cut"" due to fear of being seen by boyfriend).
   - Emotional indicators of distress, depression, hopelessness, and feeling like a burden (""don't feel like a person,"" ""suffering,"" ""baggage,"" ""issues,"" ""too much"").
   - No explicit mention of suicide, death, or dying.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide or self-harm beyond a vague reference to cutting as a coping mechanism.
   - No references to past attempts at suicide or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post focuses on suffering, depression, and thoughts of self-harm, but does not express a desire to die or end life.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Vague mention of ""cutting"" as a coping mechanism, but no specific tools, locations, or substances are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post mentions an inability to cut due to fear of being seen, not any active preparation or planning.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if suicidal thoughts were present, but since suicide is not mentioned, this reinforces 'indicator'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and struggles, with no mention of past attempts or future plans for suicide.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains expressions of distress, depression, and thoughts of self-harm, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. As per the guidelines, even significant hopelessness or distress falls under 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned. The mention of self-harm (""sh"" and ""cut"") does not equate to suicidal intent or planning in this context, and the guidelines emphasize that explicit mention of suicide is required to move beyond 'indicator'. Since there is no such mention, the post best fits 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of suicide, but it pertains to another person (the friend), not the poster themselves.
   - Emotional indicators include worry and fear for the friend’s well-being, but no personal distress or suicidal thoughts from the poster.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned regarding the poster.
   - There is a reference to a past attempt, but again, it is about the friend, not the poster.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but it relates to the friend, not the poster.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive from the poster? No, the poster expresses concern for someone else.
   - Since the post does not reflect the poster’s own suicidal thoughts, it leans toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, but for the friend, not the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not express any personal suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors from the poster. As per the important rules, the suicide risk classification only corresponds to the person writing the post, not others mentioned.

Therefore, this fits the 'indicator' category, as it lacks any direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings from the poster.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include feelings of being ""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" and ""miserable."" There is a strong expression of emotional distress and an inability to function or ""live"" properly. The person describes feeling ""ripped apart"" and unable to stop shaking.
   - There is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. While the person says, ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" this is a negation rather than an affirmation of suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and misery, but these are not tied to explicit suicidal intent.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are present.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. The statement ""It's not even that I just want to die"" suggests the person is clarifying that they do not have thoughts of dying, though they are deeply distressed.

   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation are evident (e.g., notes, acquiring means).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings of distress, not past events or future intentions regarding suicide.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. The guidelines state that even large general dissatisfaction with life or hopelessness falls under 'indicator' if suicide or killing oneself is not explicitly mentioned. The negation of wanting to die further supports this classification. There are no plans or past attempts mentioned, ruling out 'behavior' and 'attempt.' Therefore, the best fit is 'indicator.'

But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames. Let the world know that you considered yourself normal, it is the world that wronged you and the world is wrong, not you. With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem and it's not even funny. Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also. Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicidal thoughts with the statement ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (likely a typo for ""die"").
   - Emotional indicators of depression, hopelessness, and self-loathing are present (""AA DEPRESSED,"" ""you have no skills valuable to other people,"" ""everyone hates themselves"").
   - Specific plans and methods are mentioned: ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters,"" ""learn how to make nitroglycerin at home,"" ""take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" These suggest a plan for causing mayhem, potentially linked to suicide.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (interpreted as ""die"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""I WANT TO DOIE"" indicates a desire to die.
   - Since it is explicit, it moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post mentions ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters,"" ""nitroglycerin,"" and targeting a power plant, which suggest a specific plan or method for causing harm, potentially to oneself.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, there are mentions of researching how to make nitroglycerin and finding parts cheaply, indicating preparation.
   - Since there is explicit planning, it leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current or future intentions (""if you change your mind and you want to do it,"" ""take a vacation to... do your best"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I WANT TO DOIE""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It also includes a specific plan and preparation (methods like nitroglycerin, targeting a power plant), which goes beyond mere 'ideation.'
   - There are no mentions of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of wanting to die combined with a detailed plan and preparation, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

122,"Bully payback help. My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn't even know. Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!. With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of suicide in the form of a quote from the bully telling the friend to ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself."" However, this is not an expression of suicidal intent from the person writing the post or their friend.
   - Emotional indicators include descriptions of the friend being ""mentally disturbed,"" ""constantly tired,"" ""overwhelmed,"" and not doing well, indicating distress but not suicidal thoughts from the friend or the poster.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide mentioned by the poster or the friend.
   - There are no references to past suicide attempts by the poster or the friend.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but it is mentioned as a statement made by the bully to the friend, not as an expression of intent or desire by the person writing the post or their friend.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, neither the poster nor the friend expresses a personal desire to die or not be alive.
   - Since the mention of suicide is not from the person writing the post and there is no indication of personal suicidal intent, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances related to suicide by the poster or the friend.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations for suicide.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or intent from the poster, 'ideation' or 'behavior' are not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current ongoing harassment and emotional distress of the friend, but no suicidal intentions or past attempts are mentioned for the poster or the friend.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts by the poster or the friend.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not contain explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings from the person writing it. The mention of ""kill yourself"" is a quote from someone else (the bully) directed at the friend, not a personal expression of intent by the poster. The focus of the post is on the friend's distress due to harassment, but there is no indication of suicidal ideation, behavior, or past attempts by the poster. Per the rules, the suicide risk assessment only applies to the person writing the post, not others mentioned. Therefore, since there is no personal expression of suicidal intent or related behavior from the poster, this fits the 'indicator' category as it lacks explicit suicidal content from the writer.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of suicide (""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""want to hang myself"").
   - Emotional indicators are present: feelings of being a ""loser,"" ""ugly,"" ""no motivation,"" ""isolated,"" ""mental illness,"" ""alone,"" and having ""nothing to look forward to,"" which suggest deep despair and hopelessness.
   - Specific method mentioned: ""hang myself.""
   - No references to past attempts, only current thoughts and desires.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself,"" ""suicide,"" ""hang myself"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself,"" ""want to hang myself so bad"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""hang myself.""
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are mentioned, only the desire to use this method.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior,' but I must consider if the mention is detailed enough to constitute a plan.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current thoughts and feelings, not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - The mention of a specific method (""hang myself"") suggests 'behavior,' as per the definition which includes even brief mentions of a plan or method.
   - However, there is no mention of preparation or concrete steps taken, which introduces some uncertainty. Per the rules, if unsure about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - Given the explicit mention of a method, and aligning with the definition of 'behavior' (mentions a specific method), I lean toward 'behavior.' But I must adhere to the guideline of erring on the side of 'ideation' if uncertain about a detailed plan.
   - On re-evaluation, the definition of 'behavior' includes ""even if only briefly"" mentioning a plan or method, which applies here with ""hang myself.""
   - No past attempts are mentioned, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Final decision: Since a specific method is explicitly mentioned, even without detailed preparation, it fits 'behavior' as per the provided definition.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include the phrase ""still alive unfortunately,"" indicating a desire not to be alive, and explicit mention of past suicide attempts (""last night I attempted once again,"" ""15th time""). There is also a current expression of wanting to attempt again (""still want to attempt again""), though tempered by a reason to live. No specific plans or methods for future attempts are mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are implied in ""still alive unfortunately"" and the repeated attempts.
   - Specific plans or methods: No current plans or methods for suicide are mentioned; the focus is on past attempts without details of how they were carried out.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, explicitly mentioned with a count (""15th time"") and a recent event (""last night"").
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the mention of past attempts and the desire to attempt again.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied in ""still alive unfortunately"" and explicit in ""still want to attempt again.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about how past attempts were made or any current plans.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, no current preparations or specific means are mentioned.
   - Since there is no explicit planning for a current attempt, this leans away from 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to both past events (""last night I attempted once again"") and current feelings (""still want to attempt again"").
   - Past attempts are specifically described in terms of frequency and recency.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'attempt' category definition focused on historic actions.
   - There is a current expression of wanting to attempt again, but no specific plan or method is provided, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - Per the rule, if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current thoughts or plans, it should still be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'attempt' due to the clear reference to past actions, even with current ideation present.

I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I know this is going to be another failure, I'm still too scared to go all the way through. I know I'll wake up later, and while I know this, I want so badly to reach out to my friends and ask them to check up on me but I don't want to put them through something as scary as this. I don't want them to have to deal with me during this. I knew this morning the moment I woke up that it would lead to this. I've thought about it all day and throughout I've tried to be happy and loud so they wouldn't worry, so they wouldn't know what I was really thinking. I'm scared right now but I know I'll wake up. I'm sad right now and I want nothing more than someone to sit with me in silence while I cry. But I'm alone. I can't reach out. So all I ask is this, please check up on me later. I can feel myself falling asleep, but as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up. I just want to be checked up on, but I don't want to bother my friends with it. Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or dying: There is a subtle reference to hoping not to wake up (""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up""), which indicates a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of despair, sadness, fear, and hopelessness are evident (""I'm at the end of my rope,"" ""Everything's crumbling,"" ""I don't see a reason,"" ""I'm scared,"" ""I'm sad"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No explicit methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The post is vague about any specific action.
   - References to past attempts: There is a mention of having ""done this before"" and knowing ""I'll wake up,"" which could imply past behavior or attempts, but it is not clearly described as a specific past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or direct phrases like ""kill myself"" are not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" indicates a desire not to be alive, though it is not overtly explicit.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the mention of not wanting to wake up suggests a desire to die, it is not as direct as explicitly stating a wish to end one's life. However, given the context of despair and the subtle wish to not wake up, this leans toward ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to end life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since there is no mention of a plan or method, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily focuses on current feelings and thoughts (""I'm at the end of my rope right now,"" ""I'm scared right now""). The reference to having ""done this before"" and knowing ""I'll wake up"" is vague and does not clearly describe a past suicide attempt.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the past reference is ambiguous and lacks detail about a concrete action like an overdose or other specific attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - Indicator: This category applies to posts with general distress or vague feelings about death without explicit suicidal thoughts. While the post expresses deep despair and a subtle wish not to wake up, the lack of explicit mention of suicide or a direct statement of wanting to die could push this toward 'indicator.' However, the context suggests more than just vague distress.
   - Ideation: This category fits explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire not to be alive, without a specific plan. The statement ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" indicates a desire not to live, even if subtle. Given the overall tone of hopelessness and current emotional crisis, this aligns with 'ideation.'
   - Behavior: This requires a specific plan or method, which is absent here. Therefore, this category does not apply.
   - Attempt: This category is for past suicide attempts with concrete actions described. The vague reference to having ""done this before"" does not meet the criteria for a specific past attempt, so this category does not apply.
   - Final reasoning: Although the mention of not wanting to wake up is not overtly explicit, the context of extreme despair and the implied desire to die suggest 'ideation' over 'indicator.' As per the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I reconsidered, but the emotional weight and subtle expression of wanting not to wake up tip this toward 'ideation.' No plan or past attempt details push it away from 'behavior' or 'attempt.'

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, very clearly (""intent to kill myself,"" ""I am going to shoot myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with strong and explicit statements of intent to end their life.
   - No ambiguity here; it’s clearly beyond just an indicator.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, significant preparations are described, such as deleting accounts, emptying savings, clearing their room, and having the gun ready.
   - No uncertainty; this goes beyond ideation due to the specific method and preparations.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current intentions and immediate plans (""I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side,"" ""I am going to shoot myself""). Past thoughts are mentioned but no concrete past attempts are described.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past thoughts of suicide are mentioned, not actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond 'ideation' because there is a specific plan and method (loaded gun, intent to shoot) along with clear preparations (deleting accounts, emptying savings, clearing room).
   - It does not fall under 'attempt' since there is no mention of a past concrete action or attempt; the focus is on current intent and planning.
   - Given the explicit mention of suicidal intent combined with a specific method and preparations, the best fit is 'behavior.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide and a specific past attempt (""tried to pass a week ago"", ""swallowed bleach"").
   - Emotional indicators of depression, stress, and feeling unappreciated.
   - Specific plan and method described for the past attempt (leaving a note, swallowing bleach).
   - References to past suicidal episodes and a concrete past action of attempting suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the context of the past event (""thought that was the last breath"").
   - No current desire to die is expressed, as the user states they are ""a little okay now"" and ""doing better.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, for the past attempt (swallowed bleach, left a note).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, for the past attempt (note written, bleach acquired and consumed).
   - No current plan or preparation for suicide is mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily past events (attempt a week ago).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, detailed description of swallowing bleach and the aftermath.
   - No current or future suicidal plans are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post describes a specific past suicide attempt with a concrete action (swallowing bleach) and preparation (leaving a note). Although the user mentions being ""a little okay now"" and receiving support, the focus is on a historic attempt. According to the definition, 'attempt' applies when a past attempt is described, even if there are no current plans. The rule also states that if a post refers to past attempts and current plans, it should still be labeled as 'attempt', but since no current plans are mentioned, 'attempt' remains the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mention of suicide (""thinking of suicide for months on end"") and a reference to taking acid (LSD) as a potential way to cope or influence their state of mind.
   - Emotional indicators include being in the ""deepest depths"" and ""darkest corners,"" suggesting severe despair and hopelessness.
   - There is a mention of using acid as an experiment with outcomes that could lead to being ""back in the same spot or worse off,"" and accepting that their ""end will only get nearer,"" which implies a fatalistic view but not a clear plan for suicide.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""thinking of suicide for months on end"").
   - Yes, there is a direct expression of fatalistic thinking and acceptance of a potential ""end,"" which aligns with not wanting to be alive, though it is not a direct statement of intent to die.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific method for suicide is mentioned. The reference to taking acid (LSD) is presented as a coping mechanism or experiment rather than a direct means to end their life.
   - No signs of preparation for suicide (e.g., notes, acquiring lethal means) are evident.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months on end"") and a potential future outcome (""my end will only get nearer""), but there is no mention of past events or attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of suicide and ongoing thoughts about it clearly rules out 'indicator.'
   - The lack of a specific plan or method for suicide rules out 'behavior.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include hitting a ""new low,"" emotional distress (""haven't felt ok in a while""), and substance use (stealing dog's prescription hydrocodone and drinking).
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include sadness, despair, and uncertainty about what to do.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. (No)
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. (No)
   - Since it is unclear and there is no explicit mention of suicide, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods for suicide are mentioned. The use of hydrocodone and alcohol is noted, but not in the context of a suicide plan or intent to harm oneself.
   - No signs of preparation for suicide (e.g., notes, acquiring means for suicide).
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'ideation' would be considered over 'behavior,' but given no mention of suicidal thoughts, 'indicator' is more appropriate.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and events (""tonight,"" ""haven't felt ok in a while"").
   - There are no references to past attempts or current/future intentions regarding suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post lacks any explicit mention of suicide or desire to die. It reflects general distress, sadness, and substance use, but does not cross into suicidal ideation or behavior. As per the rules, even significant hopelessness or dissatisfaction with life is classified as 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, this fits the 'indicator' category.

131,31/m - I see no point in living anymore. I don't have any friends. Nothing in my life is working out,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include the statement ""I see no point in living anymore,"" which indicates a lack of desire to live. There are also expressions of loneliness (""I don't have any friends"") and general despair (""Nothing in my life is working out"").
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, death, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are present.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" suggests a desire to not be alive.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods are mentioned (tools, locations, substances).
   - No signs of preparation are evident (notes, acquiring means).
   - Since there is no planning mentioned, 'behavior' is not applicable.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses a desire to not be alive (""no point in living anymore""), which aligns with suicidal thoughts. However, the guidelines specify that the mention of suicide must be very explicit to classify as 'ideation'. Since the word ""suicide"" or a direct equivalent is not used, and the expression is more vague, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There are no plans or past attempts mentioned, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable.

132,"Update I guess. So my friend now knows this account and I didn't delete all my history so she knows how fucked up I am. I didn't anyone to know, obviously. It's unfair on them, my problems are my own not theirs. They deserve so much more than me and know I feel so guilty. &amp;#x200B;. So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a mention of taking ""a fuck load of pills"" and the possibility of not waking up tomorrow, which strongly suggests self-harm or suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include guilt, feeling ""fucked up,"" and a sense of burdening others with personal problems.
   - There is a specific mention of a method (taking pills) and an implied outcome (might not wake up), which indicates a concrete action.
   - No explicit reference to past attempts, but the current action of taking pills is described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by name, but the phrase ""might not wake up tomorrow"" after taking pills is a clear expression of intent to die or not be alive.
   - Given the context, this leans toward a direct expression of suicidal intent, so it is beyond just an 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: taking a large quantity of pills.
   - This indicates a concrete action has been taken, which goes beyond mere ideation and suggests behavior.
   - There are no additional details about preparation (e.g., acquiring pills or writing a note), but the act itself is described as having occurred.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a current action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") and a potential immediate future outcome (""might not wake up tomorrow"").
   - There is no mention of past attempts; the focus is on the present behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond 'indicator' because there is a clear implication of wanting to die through the act of taking pills.
   - It goes beyond 'ideation' because a specific method (taking pills) is mentioned, and the action appears to have been carried out.
   - It fits 'behavior' due to the explicit mention of a method and the implication of a current act of self-harm with suicidal intent.
   - It does not fit 'attempt' because there is no reference to a past event; the focus is on a current action.
   - Based on the definitions and rules, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category since there is an explicit expression of suicidal intent combined with a specific method.

I want to continue being their idea of 'normal' and 'casual', unbeknownst to them. I have an intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest. I'm tired of the constant struggle and have a fear of failing an attempt once again. I intend to do it right this time and not make those around me suffer with the blatant telling of my suicidal thoughts. I will not usher my burden into anyone else and will just silently reminisce with these feelings and my thoughts. I will go through with this, for I can't find a reason nor can I create one to continue living. I'm so proud of the people who can and do push through their suicidal thoughts and depression. I am and will not be one of those people.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide: The post explicitly mentions ""planning out my suicide"" and a clear intent to end their life.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of being ""tired of the constant struggle,"" inability to find a reason to live, and admiration for others who push through suicidal thoughts but stating they cannot do the same. This indicates deep hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions a timeline (""beginning of the new year, by January 1st, at the latest"") but does not specify a method, location, or tools for carrying out the plan.
   - References to past attempts: The post mentions a ""fear of failing an attempt once again,"" implying a past attempt or attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states ""planning out my suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a clear desire to end their life and states they cannot find a reason to continue living.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there is no mention of specific tools, locations, substances, or methods for committing suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a timeline mentioned (""January 1st, at the latest""), but no concrete actions or acquisitions of means are described.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no specific method or detailed preparation is mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation' despite the timeline.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily focuses on current and future intentions (planning for January 1st) but also references a past attempt with the phrase ""failing an attempt once again.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the past attempt is mentioned vaguely without details of what happened.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and planning, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - While there is a timeline for the intended action, there is no specific method or detailed preparation mentioned, so it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior' (as per the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when unsure about explicit planning).
   - The mention of a past attempt (""failing an attempt once again"") suggests historical action, which aligns with the 'attempt' category. Additionally, the definition of 'attempt' states that if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, despite the strong current suicidal ideation and vague planning, the reference to a past attempt combined with current plans directs the classification toward 'attempt.'

For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit statements of not wanting to live anymore (""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore"") and hating being alive (""I actually hate being alive"").
   - Emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness are present (""wish I was never born"").
   - There is a mention of wondering whether to ""just do it now"" or wait, which suggests thinking about timing but lacks specificity on how or where.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by name, but there are clear expressions of wanting to not be alive (""do not want to live anymore"") and questioning whether to ""just do it now."" (Yes to direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.)
   - Given the explicit desire to not live, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and thoughts about not wanting to live, with a vague consideration of timing (""do it now"" vs. later).
   - No past attempts are described or mentioned.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of not wanting to live, which rules out 'indicator.'
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - The best fit is 'ideation' due to the clear suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a direct mention of attempting suicide (""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently"") and a specific method of hanging (""i hang myself"").
   - Emotional indicators are not explicitly detailed beyond the act itself, but the repeated nature (""frequently"") suggests ongoing distress.
   - A specific method is described (hanging), along with a safety mechanism (using a chair or elevated object to prevent death), which shows some preparation or thought into the act.
   - The post refers to past and possibly ongoing actions, as it mentions frequent attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states ""attempt suicide frequently.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the act of attempting suicide, though the safety mechanism suggests ambivalence about dying.
   - No need to lean toward 'indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging is explicitly mentioned as the method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user describes a setup with a chair or elevated object to prevent death, indicating some planning or preparation in the act.
   - Since a method and setup are mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' or 'attempt' rather than just 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to frequent past attempts (""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently"") and implies ongoing behavior.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user describes the act of hanging with a safety mechanism, indicating past actions.
   - Since it focuses on past attempts, this aligns with the 'attempt' category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and describes a specific method (hanging) with a setup (chair or elevated object), which suggests 'behavior.' However, the focus on frequent past attempts and the detailed description of those actions align more closely with 'attempt,' as this category specifically pertains to historic actions. The definition of 'attempt' also notes that if a post refers to past attempts and current plans, it should still be labeled as 'attempt.' While the ongoing nature (""frequently"") could imply current behavior, the primary focus is on past actions. Therefore, 'attempt' is the most fitting category.

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of being ""suicidal for about 6 years"" and a past attempt at age 14, with ""close calls"" but no success.

   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for current suicidal actions are mentioned.
   - References a past attempt and ongoing struggles with suicidal thoughts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states they have been ""suicidal for about 6 years"" and mentions a past attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" and ""this world's just not meant for me.""
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this moves beyond 'indicator.'

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to commit suicide currently.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of current preparations like notes or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method mentioned for current actions, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to both a past attempt (at age 14) and current feelings of not wanting to go on.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a past attempt is mentioned, though not in detail (""I had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out"").
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a past attempt, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There are current expressions of not wanting to live, which fits 'ideation,' but no specific current plans or methods, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - The mention of a past attempt suggests 'attempt' as a possible category. Since the definition of 'attempt' includes posts describing past attempts even with current ideation, and the rule states to label as 'attempt' if past attempts are mentioned alongside current thoughts, this category seems most fitting.
   - Final decision: Given the explicit past attempt and current suicidal thoughts without a current plan, 'attempt' is the best fit per the guidelines.

   - No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post lacks any explicit mention of suicide or desire to die. It shows general frustration or distress but does not meet the threshold for 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt'. Therefore, it fits the 'indicator' category as it only reflects vague distress without explicit suicidal content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide: The post explicitly talks about ""killing myself"" and a desire to ""die in my sleep.""
   - Emotional indicators: There is a sense of determination and frustration (""I'll break killing myself regardless"") and a wish for death.
   - Specific plans or methods: The post mentions ""how to properly hang myself"" and references ""cutting again"" as a potential self-harming behavior.
   - References to past attempts: The post states ""I've done it many times,"" which could imply past attempts or repeated thoughts/behaviors, though it is not entirely clear if concrete actions were taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly mentions ""killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I just wish I could die in my sleep.""
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post mentions ""how to properly hang myself"" and ""cutting again.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a mention of figuring out a method (""how to properly hang myself""), though no immediate action or specific preparation (like acquiring tools) is described. The mention of ""too much potential interference"" suggests a delay in action rather than active preparation.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior,' but I must consider if the planning is explicit enough or if it remains more ideational.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily focuses on current thoughts and future intentions (""One of these days I'll finally do it"") with a vague reference to past actions (""I've done it many times""). It is unclear if ""done it"" refers to actual attempts or just thoughts.
   - Past attempts are not specifically described with concrete actions (e.g., no mention of a specific overdose or event), so it does not fully qualify as 'attempt.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It includes a specific method (""how to properly hang myself""), which suggests 'behavior' over 'ideation.' While there is no immediate preparation or concrete plan (e.g., acquiring a rope or setting a time), the mention of a method is enough to classify it as 'behavior' per the definition.
   - The reference to past actions (""I've done it many times"") is vague and does not clearly indicate a concrete past attempt, so 'attempt' is not the best fit. Additionally, the focus seems to be on current/future thoughts rather than a detailed history.
   - Given the explicit mention of a method and suicidal intent, 'behavior' seems the most appropriate category. If there is uncertainty about the explicitness of planning, the rule is to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but in this case, the method is clearly stated.

Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time. I am just a  Useless, shameless, pathetic loser.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or dying: The post includes references to past actions like trying to drown, hang, and jump off a building, indicating thoughts or actions related to suicide.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions specific methods used in past attempts (drowning, hanging, jumping from the 4th floor).
   - References to past attempts: Yes, the post explicitly describes past attempts at suicide with specific methods.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through descriptions of past attempts (drowning, hanging, jumping).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the person questions why they should live and expresses a desire not to waste resources by living.
   - Since suicide is explicitly referenced through past actions and current despair, this goes beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, drowning, hanging, and jumping from a specific height (4th floor) are mentioned, but these are in the context of past attempts, not current plans.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No current preparations or plans are mentioned; the methods described are tied to past actions.
   - Since there is no current explicit planning or preparation for suicide, 'behavior' may not apply, and I lean toward 'ideation' or 'attempt' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes past attempts at suicide (drowning, hanging, jumping) and expresses current feelings of hopelessness and not wanting to live.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, very clearly with specific methods and locations.
   - Given the focus on past attempts, this leans toward 'attempt', even though current ideation is also present.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide through past attempts, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It includes strong expressions of not wanting to live, which fits 'ideation', but there is no current specific plan or preparation mentioned, so 'behavior' is not the best fit.
   - The detailed description of past attempts (drowning, hanging, jumping) aligns directly with the definition of 'attempt'. Per the rules, even if current ideation is present, a post referring to past attempts should be classified as 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to die (""if you wanted to die you would"") and a clear intention to end life (""be dead in less than 24 hours"").
   - Emotional indicators include overwhelming pain (""the pain is too much"").
   - Specific plans and methods are mentioned: using Trazodone and acquiring alcohol today with a timeline (""less than 24 hours"").
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the intent to be ""dead in less than 24 hours.""
   - Yes, there is a direct expression of wanting to die.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned: Trazodone (a medication) and alcohol.
   - Yes, there are signs of preparation: planning to acquire alcohol today and a specific timeline for action (""less than 24 hours"").
   - The planning is explicit and clear, not uncertain.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current and immediate future intentions (""today"" and ""less than 24 hours"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts with a clear desire to die.
   - It also includes a specific plan with methods (Trazodone and alcohol) and preparation (acquiring alcohol today) within a defined timeline.
   - Based on the definitions, this fits 'behavior' as it includes both explicit suicidal thoughts and a concrete plan. It is not just ideation (thoughts without a plan), nor is it an indicator (lacking explicit mention), nor an attempt (no past action described).

143,"Every year I think things are going to get better, and they don't. Every year that rolls around, I think things are going to get better. Out of the whole year, I probably have 2 good months then the rest is just darkness. My sister just gave birth to my first nephew on June 3rd. My birthday is on the 14th of this month as well. I should be happy, but I'm not. I really am tired of my obsessive negative thoughts. I've been struggling since I was a child, and it's been so long since I've been happy. Nothing makes sense anymore, I want to give up. Even typing this, I feel guilty for feeling this way. The only one who is bringing myself pain is me- telling myself negative things every day. All of the abuse and shit I've experienced is in the past, and I'm still allowing it to control me. Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives? I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Strong emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and guilt are present (e.g., ""I should be happy, but I'm not,"" ""I want to give up,"" ""My life has no worth. No meaning"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, while there are strong feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, there is no direct statement about wanting to die or end life. Phrases like ""I want to give up"" and ""Why the fuck am I alive"" are vague and do not explicitly indicate a desire to die.
   - Since it is unclear and there is no explicit mention of suicide, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no mention of planning or methods, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings of despair and past struggles, but there are no references to past suicide attempts or current/future intentions to act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. As per the rules, even large general dissatisfaction with life and hopelessness falls under 'indicator' when suicide or killing oneself is not explicitly mentioned. There are also no plans or past attempts described. Therefore, this post best fits the 'indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and dying are present (""let myself pass away,"" ""finally kill me,"" ""I'm going to die"").
   - Emotional indicators include a clear intent to die and a focus on achieving a deadly outcome through anorexia.
   - Specific plan or method is mentioned: using anorexia to reach a dangerously low weight (goal of 78 pounds or lower) with the explicit intent to die.
   - No references to past attempts are made; the focus is on a current/future plan.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned as ""kill myself"" and ""let myself pass away."" (Yes)
   - There are direct expressions of wanting to die. (Yes)
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: using anorexia to reach a weight low enough to cause death.
   - There are signs of preparation or intent: setting a specific goal weight (78 pounds or lower) with the purpose of dying.
   - The plan is explicit and detailed in terms of method (starvation via anorexia).
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""my new goal weight"").
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""let myself pass away"") and a specific plan (using anorexia to reach a deadly weight). This aligns with the 'behavior' category as it includes both explicit suicidal intent and a method/plan to achieve it. It is not just ideation because a clear method is articulated. It is not 'attempt' since no past action is mentioned. It is beyond 'indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide and intent to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a mention of ""suicide"" and a specific method involving a ""charcoal BBQ in a tent.""
   - No emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair are explicitly stated, but the focus is on a method of suicide.
   - There is a specific method mentioned (charcoal BBQ in a tent), which suggests a potential plan or inquiry about a means to commit suicide.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes).
   - There is no direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive, but the question implies an interest in suicidal behavior.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans away from 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned (charcoal BBQ in a tent), which could be interpreted as exploring a means to commit suicide.
   - There are no clear signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), just a question about the possibility.
   - Since there is uncertainty about whether this constitutes explicit planning or just curiosity, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post does not refer to past events or past attempts; it seems to be a current inquiry or thought.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It includes a specific method (charcoal BBQ in a tent), but lacks evidence of active preparation or a definitive plan, so 'behavior' may not fully apply. As per the rule, when unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit mention of suicide and the exploration of a method without clear planning or preparation.

146,"Life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it. I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or dying: The post includes phrases like ""want to die"" and ""not worth it,"" as well as ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me,"" which suggest thoughts of not wanting to be alive.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, self-loathing, despair, and feeling like an embarrassment. The user describes intense dissatisfaction with life, body image, gender dysphoria, and relationship struggles.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: There are no references to past suicide attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, there are direct expressions related to dying.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post explicitly states ""want to die"" and implies a desire not to be alive with phrases like ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me."" However, the user also says, ""I don't feel like actually committing die,"" which might indicate a lack of intent to act on these thoughts.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While there is some ambiguity due to the statement ""I don't feel like actually committing die,"" the explicit mention of wanting to die leans toward 'ideation.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or methods for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since there is no evidence of planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post reflects current feelings and thoughts about not wanting to be alive, with no reference to past attempts or specific future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no descriptions of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and not wanting to be alive, which aligns with 'ideation.' However, the statement ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" introduces some ambiguity. Per the guideline, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned or intent is clear, lean toward 'indicator.' Despite this, the direct phrasing of ""want to die"" pushes it toward 'ideation.' There is no mention of a specific plan or past attempts, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable. Given the explicit desire to die, 'ideation' seems the most fitting category over 'indicator.'

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There are no direct mentions of suicide, death, or self-harm as an act the person intends to commit. However, there is a metaphorical reference to being ""put down"" like a sick dog, which could imply thoughts of death or ending suffering.
   - Emotional indicators include extreme distress, hopelessness, confusion, self-loathing (""I'm an abomination""), and a sense of being trapped or unable to find relief.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide or self-harm mentioned.
   - There are no references to past attempts at suicide; the focus is on current emotional turmoil and disturbing thoughts (e.g., wanting to hurt others or experience trauma).
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The reference to being ""put down"" is metaphorical and not a direct statement of intent to die or commit suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. While the person expresses extreme distress and a lack of desire to continue in their current state, there is no explicit statement of wanting to die or end their life.
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. There are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any concrete means of ending life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'ideation' would be considered over 'behavior' if suicidal thoughts were present, but as suicide is not explicitly mentioned, this step reinforces leaning toward 'indicator'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily focuses on current emotional struggles and disturbing thoughts, with some speculation about past trauma (""I feel like it may have happened to me before"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No. There are no mentions of past suicide attempts or concrete actions taken.
   
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die, though it conveys profound distress, hopelessness, and metaphorical language about being ""put down."" As per the guidelines, even large general dissatisfaction with life and hopelessness falls under 'indicator' if suicide or killing oneself is not explicitly mentioned. The disturbing thoughts about wanting trauma or hurting others do not directly relate to suicidal intent concerning the person writing the post. Therefore, this post best fits the 'indicator' category, as it lacks explicit suicidal content or intent.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide are explicit, with phrases like ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide seriously,"" and references to a ""suicide pact with yourself.""
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of obligation, shame, guilt, torment, tiredness, and being ""delicate"" or ""weak."" There is a strong sense of hopelessness and disconnection (""can't click into life"").
   - Specific actions mentioned include drafting a will, which suggests preparation or planning behavior.
   - No references to past attempts are made; the focus is on current and recurring thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times with clear references to ""suicide"" and ""plotting my suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, though somewhat ambiguous with statements like ""I don't think I would do 'it'"" and ""I am out of my hole for now,"" the overall tone and repeated mentions indicate a persistent desire or contemplation of not being alive.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances are mentioned for carrying out suicide. The user explicitly states they ""would never use a weapon from my household"" and would not involve others in their demise.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, drafting a will is mentioned, which can be seen as a preparatory action often associated with planning for death.
   - Since there is a specific preparatory action (drafting a will) but no explicit method or means described, I must weigh whether this constitutes a clear plan. Per the rules, if uncertain about explicit planning, I should lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.' However, drafting a will is a concrete step often linked to planning, so this leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily discusses current and recurring thoughts (""on and off for months"") and recent actions (drafting a will yesterday). There is no mention of past attempts.
   - No past attempts are described, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There is a clear expression of suicidal ideation with recurring thoughts of suicide and a sense of obligation to follow through, which fits 'ideation.'
   - The mention of drafting a will suggests preparation, which leans toward 'behavior.' However, without a specific method or means described, and given the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain about explicit planning, I must carefully consider this. Drafting a will is a significant preparatory step, but the user does not specify how they would carry out the act, and they express hesitation (""I don't think I would do 'it'""). The overall tone suggests ongoing contemplation rather than imminent action.
   - Since there are no past attempts mentioned, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit suicidal thoughts and the preparatory action of drafting a will, I lean toward 'behavior' due to the concrete step taken. However, adhering to the guideline of choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain about explicit planning (no method specified), I will classify this as 'ideation' to err on the side of caution.
   - Upon re-evaluation, the act of drafting a will is a strong indicator of planning, and in many contexts, it is considered a preparatory behavior for suicide. The user also mentions ""plotting"" suicide, which implies some level of planning. Therefore, despite the lack of a specific method, the combination of explicit suicidal thoughts and a preparatory action like drafting a will fits 'behavior' more closely.
   - Final decision: I will classify this as 'behavior' due to the explicit mention of suicide, recurring thoughts, and the specific preparatory action of drafting a will, which aligns with the definition of 'behavior' as including explicit thoughts and some form of planning or preparation.

152,"I don't want to kill myself, but. I have literally nothing going for me. I graduated college almost 2 years ago, and I still don't have a job. I pushed all my friends away. I barely leave the house anymore. All I want is to have a job so I can be a normal, functioning member of society. I just want to have a sense of purpose. I want to meet new people and go places. I'm so sick of sitting inside all day, waiting for the next day in hopes it will somehow be the day where everything changes. I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life. And at this rate, I really feel like nothing is going to change. It's been so stagnant for so long. Everyone I know has a great job, a great relationship, their own apartment; they're all moving forward in life, meanwhile I'm still sitting in the same house that I grew up in. I'm so sick of this. I've always been a melancholic guy, but I really want to give life a chance. I want to have financial independence, a girlfriend, hobbies, and see where it takes me. But it seems like the world rejects me at every turn. I've always prided myself on being a pretty tough and resilient person, but I've reached a point where I really don't know what's next for me.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The phrase ""yeet myself"" is vague and does not clearly indicate a desire to die or commit suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include strong feelings of sadness, hopelessness (""dead inside,"" ""beyond saving""), and anhedonia (lack of pleasure even on good days).
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for suicide or self-harm.
   - There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post does not directly reference suicide or killing oneself.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""yeet myself"" is ambiguous and not a clear expression of wanting to die. It could be interpreted as frustration or a desire to escape, but it lacks specificity.
   - Since it is unclear, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. There are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and recent experiences (""past couple days""), with no mention of past attempts or future plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress, sadness, and hopelessness, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. The phrase ""yeet myself"" is vague and does not meet the threshold for explicit suicidal ideation as per the guidelines.
   - There are no mentions of plans or methods, so 'behavior' does not apply.
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Following the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, this post best fits the 'indicator' category due to the lack of clear suicidal intent or thoughts.

Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of past attempt: ""I tried to end it once before.""
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of despair and self-loathing (""God im such a fucking loser""), hopelessness about life circumstances, and loneliness (""I could really use someone to talk to"").
   - Current thoughts: ""Sometimes I wish I succeeded"" indicates lingering thoughts about the past attempt and a desire for it to have worked.
   - No specific plans or methods for current or future actions are mentioned.
   - No references to current self-harm or preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to a past attempt (""I tried to end it once before"") and wishing it had succeeded.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through wishing the past attempt had succeeded, which implies a current sentiment of not wanting to be alive, though not a direct statement of current intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the past attempt is mentioned vaguely without details of how it was attempted.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of current planning or preparation for suicide.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or methods for current actions, if leaning is needed, it would be toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a past attempt (""I tried to end it once before"") and expresses a current wish that it had succeeded (""Sometimes I wish I succeeded""), but there are no current or future plans mentioned.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the past attempt is mentioned vaguely without specific details.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions a past suicide attempt, which aligns with the 'attempt' category definition (""content describes past attempts at suicide"").
   - There are current thoughts of wishing the past attempt had succeeded, which could suggest ideation, but the primary focus on a past attempt and the rule that past attempts (even with current thoughts) should be labeled as 'attempt' takes precedence.
   - No current specific plans or methods are mentioned, so 'behavior' does not apply.
   - The explicit mention of a past attempt rules out 'indicator'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'attempt' due to the reference to a historical action of trying to end their life.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of self-hatred and a wish to ""end it all"" are present, indicating thoughts of ending life.
   - Emotional indicators include deep self-loathing, despair, and mixed feelings about enduring pain versus ending it.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by name, but the phrase ""end it all"" strongly implies a desire to die or not be alive.
   - There is a direct expression of wishing for the courage to end life, though it is countered by a desire to endure and support others.
   - Since the mention of ""end it all"" is a clear reference to dying, it leans toward explicit suicidal thought, so I will classify it beyond 'indicator'.

   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?

   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Although there are positive messages and support for others, the explicit mention of wishing to end life takes precedence over categorizing it as 'indicator'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a statement about almost committing suicide a few days ago and still considering it. There is a direct reference to not being alive if not for friends.
   - Emotional indicators include severe anxiety, feeling alone, dissatisfaction with family, and isolation due to moving schools and having no friends.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned; the post states ""didn't have anything to do it with.""
   - There is a reference to a near-attempt a few days ago, but no concrete action is described (e.g., no overdose or specific act).
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""almost committed suicide"").
   - Yes, there is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive (""if my friends didn't exist i probably wouldn't be alive right now"") and still considering suicide.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described; the post explicitly states a lack of means to act.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a near-event a few days ago (""almost committed suicide"") but does not describe a concrete past attempt (no specific action taken).
   - Current thoughts are implied with ""still consider,"" indicating ongoing ideation rather than a past completed attempt.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses thoughts of not wanting to be alive, fitting the definition of 'ideation.'
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - The reference to ""almost committed suicide"" does not describe a concrete past action (e.g., no overdose or specific act), so it does not qualify as 'attempt.'
   - Based on the explicit mention of suicide and lack of planning or past concrete action, 'ideation' is the best fit.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""suicide with me"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods mentioned (no tools, locations, or substances).

166,"I want to kms but nothing is ready and I'm scared for some reason. Hello. I just got home from work and I really want to hang myself right now. I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide are explicit: ""I want to kms,"" ""I really want to hang myself right now,"" ""when I kill myself,"" and ""can't stop thinking about killing myself.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, fear, and self-loathing: ""I am a burden to my family and friends,"" ""it is what I deserve,"" and ""scared of failing.""
   - Specific method and preparation mentioned: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice’ hung for a minute or two,"" indicating a specific tool (rope) and action taken.
   - No references to past attempts, only current thoughts and actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""kms,"" ""hang myself,"" ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, very clear statements like ""I really want to hang myself right now.""
   - No ambiguity here; suicide is explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging is explicitly mentioned, along with the use of a rope.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the individual describes a ""practice"" attempt with the rope around their neck for a minute or two, and mentions future preparations like packing up the apartment, resigning from a job, and setting aside money (though not yet done).
   - The ""practice"" hanging indicates a concrete action taken toward suicide, beyond just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current thoughts and actions (""right now,"" ""trying again"") and future intentions (""when I kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of a completed past attempt, only a recent ""practice"" action which does not qualify as a full attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of a specific method (hanging with a rope) and a concrete action (""practice"" hanging), which aligns with planning or preparatory behavior.
   - While the individual mentions not having completed certain preparations (apartment packed, job resignation, money set aside), the act of practicing with a rope indicates a step toward execution, fitting the 'behavior' category.
   - Since there is no mention of a past completed attempt, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of a method and a preparatory action, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category over 'ideation.'

I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead. Then he will survive, then he won't need to work out a way to keep two people afloat with only his job. He'll only need to focus on himself and I'll finally be at peace. I told him today. I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job.

I don't want to be here any more.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and dying: The user repeatedly states a desire to die, saying ""I just want to fucking die"" and ""at least I'll be dead.""
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness, despair, feeling like a failure, overwhelmed, sobbing for hours, feeling like a burden, and explicitly stating the job is making them ""violently suicidal.""
   - Specific plans or methods: The user mentions a vague idea of using a gun (""I've always thought I was going to get a gun"") but expresses uncertainty (""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it"" and ""I don't know though"").
   - References to past attempts: There are no mentions of past suicide attempts, only current feelings and thoughts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states the job is making them ""violently suicidal"" and expresses a clear desire to die.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of acquiring means, writing notes, or other concrete preparations.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since the mention of a gun is vague and not tied to a specific plan or action, this leans toward ideation.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings and intentions, with no reference to past attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - While a gun is mentioned as a possible method, it is not part of a specific plan or preparation (e.g., no mention of acquiring a gun or setting a time/location). Per the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain about explicit planning, this fits 'ideation.'
   - There are no past attempts mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'ideation.'

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead.

I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or suicide: The post explicitly mentions ""full intentions to end things,"" which indicates suicidal thoughts or intent.
   - Emotional indicators: There are strong feelings of despair and numbness (""sleep and sleep and be numb,"" ""fast travel to a time when I feel like myself""), as well as a sense of loneliness and apathy from others.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user mentions driving up to the mountains with the intention to ""end things,"" which suggests a location and a potential plan, though no specific method (e.g., jumping, overdose) is described.
   - References to past attempts: There are no mentions of past suicide attempts; the focus is on a current impulsive action that was not carried out.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""full intentions to end things,"" which clearly implies suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the intent to ""end things"" and the desire to ""sleep and be numb"" suggest a wish to escape life or not be alive, even if not fully acted upon.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is described (e.g., no mention of a tool, substance, or exact action like jumping). The mention of driving to the mountains with intent is vague regarding the ""how.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Driving to the mountains with intent could be seen as a preparatory action, but it remains unclear if this constitutes a concrete plan since no specific method is detailed.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Given the lack of a specific method, I lean toward 'ideation' despite the location being mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a recent impulsive action (driving to the mountains) with current intentions that were not acted upon (""I don't think I'm going to do it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no past attempts mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""full intentions to end things""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - While a location (mountains) is mentioned, there is no specific method or detailed plan described, and the user states they are unlikely to act on the impulse (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). Per the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain about explicit planning, this fits 'ideation.'
   - There are no past attempts mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'ideation' due to explicit suicidal thoughts without a clear, specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of being ""ready to die"" and readiness to ""go out the way I want,"" which strongly suggest suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include despair and dissatisfaction with life (""nothing in my life is changing,"" ""fuck this world""), showing hopelessness.
   - There are references to preparations (""preps being made"") and a set date for an event, implying planning.
   - No mention of past attempts, only current readiness and future intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by term, but ""ready to die"" and ""go out the way I want"" are clear expressions of wanting to end one's life. (Yes to direct expression of wanting to die.)
   - Given the explicit desire to die, this goes beyond a vague indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific method is mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances named).
   - There are signs of preparation (""preps being made,"" ""date was set""), but these are vague and not detailed.
   - Since the planning is not explicit in terms of method or means, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I'm ready,"" ""date was set,"" ""preps being made"").
   - No reference to past attempts, so 'attempt' category does not apply.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die, which rules out 'indicator.'
   - While there are mentions of preparations and a set date, the lack of specific methods or detailed plans suggests it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior.'

   - The phrase ""im going to do it"" suggests intent, though it is not explicitly clear what ""it"" refers to.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (no direct use of terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die"").
   - There is an implied expression of not wanting to live through phrases like ""i cant do this anymore"" and ""im done,"" but it is not direct.
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable, and I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if intent is considered, but the lack of explicit mention of suicide keeps it at 'indicator'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""im going to do it""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness, with a vague implication of intent (""im going to do it""). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide or desire to die, and no specific plan or method is provided. As per the guidelines, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the classification should be 'indicator' even with strong dissatisfaction or hopelessness. The ambiguity and lack of direct reference to suicide or dying lead me to classify this as 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

176,What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?. I know that's it's stupid but I've got a lot of stress right now and it would just be a lot easier. I've also never really seen myself going anywhere in life so. why not.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a direct question about a ""mostly painless way to kill myself,"" indicating a focus on suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include stress and a lack of purpose or future (""never really seen myself going anywhere in life""), suggesting hopelessness.
   - There is a query about methods (""painless way""), but no specific plan, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are present.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned with the phrase ""kill myself."" (Yes)
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die implied through the question and reasoning (""it would just be a lot easier""). (Yes)
   - No need to lean toward 'indicator' as the mention is explicit.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A general inquiry about a ""painless way"" is made, but no specific method, tool, location, or substance is mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are indicated.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or specific method, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current thoughts and intentions, not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to die, fitting the definition of 'ideation.'
   - While there is a question about a method, it is not specific or detailed enough to constitute a plan, so 'behavior' is not appropriate.
   - No past attempts are mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - The explicit mention of suicide rules out 'indicator.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation.'

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide and overdosing as a method of suicide are present.
   - Emotional indicators are not directly expressed by the poster; the post focuses on providing information or a warning about overdosing rather than personal feelings of hopelessness or despair.
   - Specific methods (overdosing on pills) and detailed descriptions of the process and consequences are included.
   - No references to past attempts by the poster; the content is more informational or advisory in nature.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" and discusses overdosing as a means to end life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the poster does not express a personal desire to die or commit suicide; the tone is more of a caution or warning to others.
   - Since the post does not reflect the poster’s own suicidal thoughts but discusses suicide explicitly, I need to consider the context and intent.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, overdosing on pills is described in detail, including the process and physical effects.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post does not indicate any personal preparation or intent by the poster to act on this method; it seems to be a general warning or informational content.
   - Since there is no personal plan or preparation mentioned by the poster, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if classifying based on content alone, but I must focus on the poster’s intent.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post does not refer to past events or personal current/future intentions of the poster; it is a general discussion about overdosing.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no personal past attempts mentioned by the poster.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a specific method (overdosing), but it lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts or plans by the poster. The content is framed as a warning or informational piece rather than a reflection of the poster’s own risk.
   - Per the rules, the suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not others. Since the poster does not express personal suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or plans, it does not fit 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt'.
   - Although suicide is explicitly mentioned, the lack of personal intent or emotional expression by the poster suggests it falls under 'indicator', as it does not meet the criteria for the other categories which require personal suicidal thoughts or actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of intending to ""do it"" in the future, which in context likely refers to suicide or ending their life.
   - Emotional indicators include lack of motivation to live, mental health issues, and feeling fed up with life.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the phrase ""do it"" is not a direct mention of suicide, but the context strongly implies a desire to end their life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a lack of motivation to keep living and implies a future intent to end their life.
   - Since it's not fully explicit but strongly implied, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mention.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, I would lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if classifying as ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to future intentions (""im gonna do it in the future"") and current feelings of low motivation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or killing oneself, only implying it with ""do it"" and expressing a lack of desire to live. As per the rule, when in doubt about explicit mention of suicide, I must choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it cannot be 'behavior'.
   - There are no past attempts described, so it cannot be 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, despite the strong implication of suicidal thoughts, the lack of explicit mention of suicide leads me to classify this as 'indicator'.

   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. (No)

   - Since there is no planning or behavior described, this does not fit 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post does not refer to past events or current/future intentions related to suicide.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress and dissatisfaction with life but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans to end life. Per the definitions, even strong general dissatisfaction or emotional pain falls under 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned. Since there is no mention of suicide or related thoughts, 'indicator' is the most appropriate category.

There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - The post describes a vivid and terrifying dream involving mass murder by a group of men at a school and the user's home. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the user themselves. The focus is on external violence and fear.
   - Emotional indicators include severe panic, terror, and anxiety about sleeping due to intense dreams.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations related to suicide or self-harm.
   - There are no references to past attempts or personal suicidal thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
   - Since there is no mention of suicide or desire to die, this leans toward 'indicator' if any distress is considered, but the context is unrelated to personal suicide risk.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not in the context of suicide or self-harm by the user. The violence described is external and part of a dream.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, none related to suicide.
   - Since there is no planning or intent related to suicide, this does not fit 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a dream (past event) and current anxiety about sleeping, but nothing related to suicide or self-harm.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide or self-harm by the user. It describes a distressing dream and resulting anxiety, but there is no mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts. As per the definition, even general distress or fear does not qualify as 'ideation' unless suicide or a desire to die is explicitly mentioned. Therefore, this fits the 'indicator' category as it reflects distress but no direct or indirect reference to personal suicide risk.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or suicide: The post includes phrases like ""what comes after"" and ""end this suffering,"" which suggest thoughts of death or suicide. There is also a request for ""strength and a reason"" to end suffering, implying a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of despair, fear, and a need for something to believe in indicate deep emotional distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned in the current context.
   - References to past attempts: The post explicitly mentions having overdosed twice, once accidentally and once on purpose, indicating past suicidal behavior.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end this suffering"" and the context of wanting strength to ""do it,"" which strongly imply suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post conveys a clear desire to end suffering, which in this context suggests a wish to die.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The intent is fairly clear, so no need to default to 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of specific tools, locations, or substances for a current plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of current preparations like writing notes or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since there is no explicit current plan, this leans toward 'ideation' for current thoughts, but past attempts need consideration.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to both past events (overdoses) and current intentions (seeking strength to ""end this suffering"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user mentions overdosing twice, with one instance being intentional.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end suffering, which aligns with suicidal ideation.
   - There is no current specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - However, the mention of past attempts (overdosing on purpose) fits the definition of 'attempt.' According to the rules, if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans or thoughts, it should still be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Given the explicit reference to past suicidal actions (intentional overdose), the category 'attempt' takes precedence as per the definition focusing on historic actions.

   - Since it is explicit, it cannot be classified as just an 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts at suicide; the mention of ""Everytime I try I fail"" seems to refer to general life struggles rather than suicide attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include an explicit mention of ""suicide by hanging,"" indicating a focus on a specific method of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators are not directly stated (e.g., hopelessness or despair), but the inquiry about pain and the mention of having ""tied the noose"" suggest serious intent or contemplation.
   - There is a specific mention of a method (hanging) and preparation (tying the noose).
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide by hanging"").
   - Yes, there is an implied desire to die or not be alive, as the user is asking about the experience of suicide and mentions preparing a noose, though they state they are ""still not sure.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (hanging).
   - Yes, there are signs of preparation (the user states they have ""already tied the noose"").

   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of a specific method (hanging) and preparation (tying the noose), which aligns with planning.
   - There is no mention of a past attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of a method and preparation, 'behavior' is the most fitting category. The uncertainty (""still not sure"") does not negate the preparation already taken, and per the rules, if there is specific planning, 'behavior' is appropriate over 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Key elements include strong expressions of hatred toward family, particularly the father and grandfather, mentions of past trauma (sexual assault by grandfather), and a general statement of wanting to ""end it.""
   - Emotional indicators: Intense anger, hatred, and distress are evident. The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" suggests a desire to escape or stop the pain.
   - No specific mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm methods are present beyond the vague phrase ""end it.""
   - No references to past attempts or specific plans/preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not directly mention suicide or killing oneself.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" is vague and could imply a desire to end life, but it is not explicit.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains strong emotional distress and a vague statement (""i just wanna end it""), but lacks explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. As per the guidelines, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the classification should lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.' There is no mention of a plan or past attempts, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' do not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'indicator' due to the lack of explicit suicidal intent or ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of suicide, specifically ""on the brink of suicide,"" but it is not a personal expression of current suicidal thoughts by the poster. The post discusses past feelings of not being able to cope and offers an alternative lifestyle (going ""hobo"" or vagrant) as a solution.
   - Emotional indicators include past feelings of distress (""felt like I couldn't cope""), but the tone seems reflective and somewhat positive about the alternative lifestyle.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide mentioned.
   - There are no references to past suicide attempts, only to difficult times in life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""on the brink of suicide"" is mentioned, but it is not a direct expression of the poster's current desire to die or commit suicide. It is more of a general reference or advice to others.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the poster does not express a current personal desire to die or not be alive.
   - Since it is unclear if this counts as a personal expression of suicidal thoughts and the mention is not a direct statement of intent or desire, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances related to suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations for suicide.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past events (""there have been more than a few occasions,"" ""on two of those occasions"") and offers a solution for the future, but not in the context of current suicidal intent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, only general struggles.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post mentions suicide explicitly but not as a personal current desire or intent. It lacks direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive by the poster. As per the guidelines, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned as a personal thought or desire, I should choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.' There is no plan or past attempt mentioned, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' do not apply. Therefore, 'indicator' is the most fitting category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of despair and loneliness (""I'm so lonely I can't go on anymore""), a sense of life worsening over time, addiction, and isolation (""haven't been able to see my friends for years""). 
   - There is a direct mention of ending life (""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"").
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and regret (""I fucked up my life"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances specified for the act).
   - No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned with the phrase ""then end it,"" which in context strongly implies ending their life (Yes).
   - There is a direct expression of not wanting to continue living (""I can't go on anymore"") and a clear intent to end life (Yes).
   - The mention is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond a vague indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods are mentioned (e.g., no mention of how they plan to ""end it"").
   - No signs of preparation are described (e.g., no notes, acquiring means, or specific actions).
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and a future intention (""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"").
   - There is no mention of past attempts or events related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""then end it""), which rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'.
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - The best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit expression of wanting to end life without a specific plan.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user states they have 800mg of codeine and access to ibuprofen, suggesting they have the means ready or are considering acquiring them.
   - No uncertainty here; the mention of specific drugs and intent is clear.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current or future intentions (""Will I be able to...""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions a desire to end life, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond vague suicidal thoughts by mentioning specific substances (codeine and ibuprofen) and questioning their effectiveness, which indicates a plan or method, ruling out 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of not wanting to live: The post includes phrases like ""why should I live,"" ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""I can't live like this,"" and ""can't stand being here any other moment.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and suffering are present (""I failed everything,"" ""I'm not happy or enjoying anything,"" ""nobody understands me,"" ""I suffer everyday,"" ""never been happy since birth"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"" is not used, but there are clear expressions of not wanting to live.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""resisting the desire to end"" and ""why should I live"" strongly imply a desire to not be alive.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned as a term, but the intent is clear, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline (""if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any specific way to end life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable. If there were uncertainty, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but the lack of explicit suicide mention pushes toward 'indicator.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post reflects current feelings and struggles, with no mention of past attempts or specific future plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains strong expressions of despair and not wanting to live, which align with suicidal thoughts. However, the guideline specifies that the mention of suicide must be very explicit to move beyond 'indicator.' Since the term ""suicide"" or a direct equivalent like ""kill myself"" is not used, and the expressions are more about not wanting to live rather than a clear intent to die by suicide, I must classify this as 'indicator.' If I were to disregard the strict rule on explicit mention, it would lean toward 'ideation' due to the clear desire to not be alive. But per the rule (""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'""), I will classify it as 'indicator.'

   - Since it is explicit, it leans away from 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

Will anyone read this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of distress, financial mistakes, feeling overwhelmed, and hearing voices telling the person to ""end myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness, despair, inability to cope, crying, and seeking help or a solution.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned with the phrase ""end myself,"" which indicates a desire to die.
   - There is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts through the voices telling the person to end their life, though it is not a clear personal statement of intent.
   - Since it is explicit, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - Since there is no explicit planning, it aligns with 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and struggles, not past events or future intentions beyond the vague mention of ending oneself.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit mention of suicidal thoughts (""end myself"") but lacks any specific plan or method for suicide. This fits the definition of 'ideation' as it expresses a desire to not be alive without concrete planning. It is not just general distress (which would be 'indicator'), and it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior' (no plan) or 'attempt' (no past action described).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of dying with the phrase ""maybe I don't need to die,"" which suggests thoughts about death or not wanting to live, but it is framed in a somewhat hopeful or reflective way.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of not being okay right now, past abuse, and a desire for care and support, which suggest distress or sadness.
   - There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide or self-harm.
   - There are no references to past attempts at suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not directly mention suicide or killing oneself. The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" is vague and not an explicit statement of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" implies a consideration of death but is not a clear or direct expression of wanting to die. It leans more toward reflection or hope.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since the mention of death is vague and not explicitly tied to suicide or a desire to die, I will lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any specific means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': This does not apply as there is no planning mentioned at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings of not being okay and a hope for a better future. The mention of death seems to be a current reflection rather than a past event or future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or a clear desire to die. The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" is vague and not a direct expression of suicidal intent. It reflects distress and a hope for improvement rather than a concrete wish to end life.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or past attempts mentioned.
   - According to the rules, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned, I should lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Given the vague nature of the death reference and the overall hopeful tone, 'indicator' seems the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a question about dying from taking 3 Xanax pills, explicit mention of suicidal thoughts when bored, and a desire to be calm.
   - Emotional indicators: Boredom linked to suicidal thoughts, suggesting distress.
   - Specific plan or method: Mention of taking 3 Xanax pills, questioning if it can cause death.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned as an intent (the user says ""I don’t wanna die rn""), but suicidal thoughts are explicitly acknowledged (""when I’m bored suicidal thoughts are always there"").
   - There is no direct expression of wanting to die at the moment, but the question about dying from Xanax raises concern.
   - Since there is explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, this leans away from 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific method mentioned: Taking 3 Xanax pills.
   - No clear signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring pills or writing notes), but the user states they will do it anyway and is asking about the worst outcome.
   - The mention of a specific substance and quantity (3 Xanax pills) with a question about death suggests a potential plan, even if the intent to die is not explicitly stated. This leans toward 'behavior' over 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current thoughts and potential actions (""rn"" and ""I will do it anyway""), not past events.
   - No mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - There is a specific method mentioned (3 Xanax pills) and a question about dying from it, which suggests a potential plan, even if the user claims they don’t want to die right now. This aligns with 'behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method.
   - Since there is uncertainty about the intent to die (user says ""I don’t wanna die rn""), but a method is mentioned, I will follow the guideline to choose 'behavior' over 'ideation' when a specific plan or method is present.
   - No past attempts are mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about how the user plans to kill themselves or self-harm (no tools, locations, or substances specified).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of actions taken like writing notes or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no specific plan is mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The mention of killing oneself is a future intention (""I will wait until I can kill myself""), though conditional.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains an explicit mention of wanting to kill oneself, which rules out 'indicator.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a clear desire to die with the statement about killing themselves and wishing they weren’t born.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a mention of ""plummet to the ground"" from the ""highest floor,"" which implies a method of suicide (jumping from a height). 
   - Emotional indicators are present, such as the complexity of the decision, guilt, and fear of consequences (being crippled or leaving others behind), which suggest distress and ambivalence.
   - A specific method (jumping from a height) and location (highest floor) are mentioned, indicating a concrete idea of how to carry out the act.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned with terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but the intent to die is implied through the phrase ""plummet to the ground"" and the reference to becoming a ""corpse.""
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die, as the post describes a temptation to act in a way that would likely result in death. Since it’s not entirely explicit (no direct ""I want to die""), I lean toward caution, but the context strongly suggests suicidal intent, so I’ll consider it explicit enough for ideation at minimum.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: jumping from the ""highest floor"" to ""plummet to the ground.""
   - A location is implied (highest floor), which adds specificity to the thought.
   - No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are mentioned, but the specificity of the method and location pushes this beyond vague ideation. Since there’s a clear method and implied location, I lean toward 'behavior,' but I must consider if this is explicit planning or just a thought.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a current temptation (""so tempted to just go""), indicating present or future intentions rather than past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - This post goes beyond 'indicator' because there is a clear implication of wanting to die through the described action, even if the word ""suicide"" isn’t used.
   - It qualifies as at least 'ideation' due to the expression of a desire to die (implied through ""plummet to the ground"" and ""corpse"").
   - However, the mention of a specific method (jumping) and location (highest floor) suggests a plan, which aligns with 'behavior.' Since there’s no mention of concrete preparation (e.g., going to the location or having access), I must weigh if this is explicit planning. Per the rule, if unsure about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - Since no past attempts are mentioned, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the specificity of method and location, I believe this crosses into 'behavior,' but I’ll adhere to the cautionary rule if there’s doubt. Upon reflection, the mention of ""highest floor"" and ""plummet"" is specific enough to be considered a plan, so 'behavior' seems appropriate.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains an explicit mention of suicide (""kill myself""), ruling out 'indicator.'

I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage, contemplating jumping, and expressing a desire to gain the courage to do so.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of being unnoticed, a lack of care from others, and a struggle to find the nerve to act.
   - Specific location (hospital parking garage ledge) is mentioned as a potential method for suicide.
   - No direct mention of past attempts by the poster, though a past suicide at the same location by someone else is referenced.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly implied through the act of standing on a ledge and trying to work up the nerve to jump. (Yes)
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die, as the poster hopes to gain courage to jump. (Yes)

   - The post refers to current and repeated behavior (standing/sitting on the ledge) with future intentions (hoping to gain courage to jump).
   - No past attempts by the poster are described, only a reference to someone else’s past suicide at the same location.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (wanting to jump) and a specific method/location (jumping from a hospital parking garage ledge), which aligns with the definition of 'behavior'.
   - Although there is no mention of additional preparations (like a note), the specificity of the method and location, combined with repeated behavior at the site, supports 'behavior' over 'ideation'.
   - There is no mention of a past attempt by the poster, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - The explicit nature of the suicidal intent and method rules out 'indicator'.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide: The user explicitly talks about past suicide attempts and current thoughts of dying, including searching for ways to make their death look like an accident.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, and feeling like a burden to family. The user feels their death might be the ""ultimate answer"" to bring family closer.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user mentions past use of a phone charger for an attempt and currently searching for ways to make their death look like an accident, though no specific method or concrete plan is detailed for the present.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, multiple past suicide attempts are explicitly mentioned, including a specific method (phone charger) for the first attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user talks about past attempts and current thoughts of dying.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user states their death seems like the ""ultimate answer"" and expresses ongoing thoughts of suicide.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Not applicable, as suicide is explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? For past attempts, yes (phone charger). For current thoughts, the user mentions searching for ways to make it look like an accident but does not specify a method or concrete plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No clear evidence of current preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). Searching for information online is noted but not specific.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since current planning is not detailed or specific, lean toward 'ideation' for current thoughts, but past attempts are concrete.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. The post describes past suicide attempts in detail and expresses current thoughts of dying, including searching for methods.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the first attempt with a phone charger is described, and multiple attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions past suicide attempts with a specific method (phone charger), which aligns with the 'attempt' category definition focused on historic actions.
   - Additionally, there are current suicidal thoughts and mentions of searching for ways to die (making it look like an accident), but no specific current plan or preparation is detailed, which would typically lean toward 'ideation' for current thoughts.
   - Per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans or thoughts, it should be labeled as 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, despite the current ideation, the presence of detailed past attempts and the rule to prioritize 'attempt' in such cases lead to classifying this as 'attempt'.

Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of being ""dead inside,"" hopelessness, and frustration (""done with everything"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the phrase ""dead inside"" is metaphorical and does not explicitly indicate a desire to die. ""Done with everything"" is vague and not a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - Since it is unclear and lacks explicit mention of suicide, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or methods, 'behavior' is not applicable. If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but in this case, even 'ideation' is not supported due to lack of explicit suicidal thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post reflects current feelings of frustration and hopelessness.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or desire to die. The phrases ""dead inside"" and ""done with everything"" are vague and metaphorical, not direct indicators of suicidal intent. There are no mentions of plans, methods, or past attempts. Per the guidelines, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the classification should be 'indicator', even in cases of strong dissatisfaction or hopelessness.

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include the mention of jumping off, specifically out of a bedroom window, and a description of the location below (trees and mud). 
   - Emotional indicators include a sense of building courage to perform the act, suggesting intent and determination.
   - Specific plans or methods are mentioned: jumping out of a bedroom window.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned by name, but there is a clear implication of self-harm or intent to end life through the act of jumping out of a window.
   - There is a direct expression of intent to perform the act (""Hopefully I can do it soon""), which aligns with a desire to not be alive, even if not explicitly stated as suicide.
   - Since it is not entirely explicit about suicide, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation', but the intent and specific method push toward a higher category.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: jumping out of a bedroom window.
   - The location is described (trees and mud below), and there is a sense of preparation or mental readiness (""getting more courage"").
   - Given the explicit method and intent, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current or future intentions (""Hopefully I can do it soon""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - While suicide is not explicitly named, the post contains a clear intent to harm oneself through a specific method (jumping out of a window) and shows signs of mental preparation (building courage). 
   - Per the definitions, 'behavior' fits best because of the explicit mention of a method and plan, even if briefly described. If there were no specific method, it would be 'ideation', but the details provided push it to 'behavior'.

203,"Should I tell my mom about my issues. I know most peoples first reaction is ""yes, having help only makes it better"" but I feel like I don't really have that relationship with her. There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is an explicit mention of ""writing suicide notes,"" which directly relates to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of depression, frustration, and a sense of burden or hopelessness (e.g., ""depression hits really hard,"" ""feel like I'd just waste their time"").
   - There is a specific mention of ""writing suicide notes,"" which could imply preparation or a step toward a plan.
   - No references to past attempts are made; the focus seems to be on current struggles.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""writing suicide notes.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly, as the post does not explicitly state a desire to die or end their life, but the mention of suicide notes strongly implies suicidal thoughts.
   - Since there is an explicit reference to suicide-related behavior (writing notes), this leans toward more than just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances are mentioned for carrying out suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" suggests a form of preparation or concrete action related to suicide.
   - Since there is a mention of preparation (suicide notes) but no specific method or detailed plan, this is a borderline case. Per the rules, if uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current struggles and actions (""next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes""), not past attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide through ""writing suicide notes,"" ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There is no direct expression of a desire to die, but the act of writing suicide notes implies suicidal thoughts, fitting 'ideation.'
   - While writing suicide notes could be seen as preparation, there is no specific method or detailed plan mentioned, so per the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain, 'ideation' seems more appropriate.
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit mention of suicide-related content without a clear, specific plan.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, just a reference to cutting too deep.
   - Since there is no explicit planning for suicide, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if suicidal intent were implied, but it is not explicitly stated here.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a mention of wanting to die (""kinda just wanna die"") alongside conflicting feelings (""but dont at the same time""). There are emotional indicators of distress, boredom, and hopelessness (""struggle to get up,"" ""find everything boring""). The post mentions social isolation (""friends are the only thing keeping me going,"" ""dont have many since they all left"") and bullying leading to school avoidance.
   - No specific mentions of death methods, self-harm, or past attempts.
   - No specific plans or preparations for suicide are described.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (the post says ""wanna die"" but does not directly reference suicide or killing oneself).
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die (""kinda just wanna die""), though it is ambivalent due to the conflicting statement.
   - As per the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I note the mention is not explicitly about suicide but about dying, which could be interpreted as vague.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.

   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains a vague expression of wanting to die, but it is not an explicit mention of suicide or killing oneself. There are strong indicators of distress and hopelessness, but as per the definition of 'indicator,' even large general dissatisfaction with life falls under 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned. The rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt applies here since ""wanna die"" is not a clear, direct reference to suicide. There is no plan or past attempt mentioned, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that.

   - There is a specific plan mentioned: driving to the mountains, hiking off paths, finding a spot to hang oneself.
   - No references to past attempts are made; the focus is on current thoughts and a potential future action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""better off dead,"" ""too scared to end it,"" and a specific idea of hanging oneself.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""no reason to keep going"" and planning to ""rest in peace"" after hanging oneself.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (planning to hang oneself).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts, only past thoughts of ending it but not acting on them.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""better off dead,"" ""no reason to keep going""), which rules out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond mere ideation because there is a specific plan mentioned (hanging oneself in the mountains after driving and hiking to a spot), including a method and location.
   - There are no past attempts described, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of suicide and a detailed plan, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category. The specificity of the method and steps to carry it out align with the definition of 'behavior' over 'ideation.'

   - The explicit mention of wanting to die rules out 'indicator.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation.'

211,"its supposed to get better but i want to know when. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm doing everything people say they do to get better but it's just not working. I take care of my body: I workout 5-7 times a week, I sleep 8-10 hrs a night, I eat nutritious meals. I'm part of a prestigious grad program for my field, one that I should be proud of and is undeniably an accomplishment. I volunteer regularly with womens groups and lgbtq groups. I'm on medication and I see a therapist weekly. When I'm sad, I journal, I use DBT skills, I try to fight cognitive distortions. But I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal. People say to wait it out, but its been years. Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts. Its supposed to get better but I just want to know when. I read so many articles and videos and posts about people that have recovered from being suicidal and I just don't get why I'm plagued with this. I'm doing all the same things. Its so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on when I dont even know what else to try at this point. I'm just tired of all of it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicidal thoughts are present (""I try to suppress my suicidal thoughts"").
   - Emotional indicators include distress and a wish to not be like this (""I wish I wasn't like this"").
   - A specific method for suicide is mentioned (using eye drops in beverages as inspired by a video).

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the mention of suppressing suicidal thoughts and not wanting to ""have to do that.""

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of actual preparation or acquiring means; it is presented as an idea.

   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?

   - It goes beyond vague ideation by mentioning a specific method (eye drops in beverages), which aligns with 'behavior' as per the definition of including any mention of a plan or method, even briefly.
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Although there is no concrete preparation, the explicit mention of a method pushes this into 'behavior' rather than 'ideation' based on the guideline to consider specific ideas of methods as 'behavior.'

214,"I think I've come to realize I'm the common denominator in all of my problems. A month ago I wrote a suicide note. I realized the date when I was going through my screenshots and found the note, primed and ready to be posted on social media so nobody wonders why I stopped responding to calls or going to work. Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Yes, explicit mention of a past suicide note and planning.
   - Emotional indicators: Feelings of frustration, self-blame, and a desire to feel the ""calm"" associated with planning suicide again.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: Yes, mentions writing a suicide note a month ago, planning a time and place, and having it ready to post on social media.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of a concrete past attempt (e.g., no action like an overdose is described), only planning and preparation that did not result in an attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post mentions a suicide note and planning.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a desire to ""free myself of my problems"" and hints at wanting to feel the calm of planning again, with a suggestion of possibly ""doing it this time.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a suicide note, a chosen time, and a place were planned in the past. Current intentions are less specific but imply revisiting those plans.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, past preparation (note ready to post on social media). Current preparation is not explicitly mentioned but hinted at with ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time.""
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': While past planning is clear, current planning is not fully explicit, but the intent to possibly act again is strongly implied.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. It describes past planning (a month ago) and current thoughts of possibly doing it again (""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only planning is described, not a concrete action like an overdose or other attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - Indicator: Not applicable, as suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Ideation: Could apply if focusing only on thoughts without current explicit plans, but the post goes beyond mere thoughts with past detailed planning and current hints of intent.
   - Behavior: Fits because of explicit past planning (note, time, place) and current expressions suggesting intent to possibly act again (""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time""). The mention of specific preparations in the past and the current desire to revisit that state lean toward behavior.
   - Attempt: Not applicable, as no concrete past attempt is described, only planning. However, the rule states that if a post refers to past attempts and mentions current plans, label as 'attempt.' Since there is no past attempt (only planning), this does not fully apply, but current intent is present.
   - Final reasoning: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and past specific planning (note, time, place), which meets the criteria for 'behavior.' The current hint of intent (""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"") further supports 'behavior' over 'ideation.' Since no past attempt is concretely described, 'attempt' does not apply.

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm are present in the post.
   - Strong emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, loneliness, and feeling like a burden (""I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world"", ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide or self-harm are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts at suicide or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, there are vague feelings of being a burden or fading away (""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone""), but no explicit desire to die or end one's life.
   - Since it is unclear and lacks explicit mention of suicide, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances related to suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'ideation' would be considered over 'behavior', but given the lack of explicit suicidal thoughts, 'indicator' is more appropriate.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings of despair and past experiences of abuse, but there are no mentions of past suicide attempts or current/future intentions to harm oneself.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains strong expressions of emotional distress, hopelessness, and loneliness, but there is no explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans to harm oneself. As per the definitions, even significant dissatisfaction with life and feelings of being a burden fall under 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, this post best fits the 'indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?

   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of being ""done with life"" and causing pain indicate hopelessness and despair.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to future intentions (""Tuesday"") and current feelings (""done with life"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""want to die"") and goes beyond ideation by mentioning specific methods (""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself"") and a timeline (""Tuesday""). This aligns with the definition of 'behavior' as it includes explicit planning. There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply. The explicit nature of the methods and timeline rules out 'indicator' and 'ideation.'

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that.

His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicidal thoughts are explicit (""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"", ""it would be better if I was dead"", ""suicide would be better"").
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of emptiness, questioning the point of life, and a sense of futility despite having positive aspects in life (friends, family, hobbies).
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The post focuses on thoughts and feelings rather than actions.
   - No references to past attempts are made; the focus is on current thoughts.

Last time I called a hotline just to have someone to talk to (didn't have a method or anything), I ended up having the cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward for 3 days. It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions past experience with a hotline leading to police intervention and a psych ward stay. It also states that the experience made the person ""10x more suicidal."" There is a request for a hotline that won't track location or call authorities, indicating fear and paranoia about being located or intervened with.
   - Emotional indicators: Fear, paranoia, and distress are evident. The statement ""made me 10x more suicidal"" suggests heightened suicidal feelings, though not necessarily current intent.
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Suicide is explicitly mentioned in the context of feeling ""more suicidal"" due to past events, but there is no direct statement of current desire to die or end life.
   - Specific plans or methods: No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - Past attempts: No past attempts are described, only a past intervention experience.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in the phrase ""made me 10x more suicidal.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, there is no direct statement of current intent or desire to die, only a reference to feeling more suicidal due to a past event.
   - Since the mention is not a direct expression of current intent and is tied to a past experience, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline to choose 'indicator' when in doubt.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no planning or method mentioned, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to a past event (hotline call leading to intervention) and expresses current worry about being tracked, but no current suicidal intent or plans are stated.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only a past intervention is described, not an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions feeling ""more suicidal"" due to a past event, but lacks a direct expression of current desire to die or not be alive. There are no plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, ruling out 'behavior.' There are no past attempts described, ruling out 'attempt.' Given the guideline to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit suicidal intent, and since the mention of suicide is tied to a past experience rather than a current desire, 'indicator' seems the most appropriate classification. The post reflects distress and fear but does not cross the threshold of explicit current suicidal ideation.

   - Mentions of death/suicide: Yes, explicit mention of ""killing myself every day.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of loneliness, tiredness, sadness, disappointment, and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans or methods: Mentions preparations like ""suicide note, bills, testament"" and everything being ""ready.""
   - References to past attempts: No specific past attempts mentioned, only current feelings and preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing myself every day.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, clear statement of suicidal thoughts and a potential ""final goodbye.""
   - Since it's explicit, no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method or tool (e.g., no mention of weapons, locations, or substances), but preparations are mentioned (""suicide note, bills, testament"" and ""everything's ready"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, clear signs of preparation with the note and tying up personal affairs.
   - Since there are explicit preparations, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current feelings and future intentions (""this might be my final goodbye"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, no past attempts mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself every day""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond vague thoughts of not wanting to live, as there are specific preparations mentioned (suicide note, bills, testament), which aligns with 'behavior.'
   - While no exact method (e.g., tool or location) is mentioned, the mention of preparations like a suicide note and tying up affairs indicates planning, fitting the 'behavior' category.
   - No past attempts are described, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'behavior' due to explicit suicidal thoughts combined with evidence of planning and preparation.

I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting. I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog. I haven't talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks i'm ok. I'm not though. I don't know what to do anymore.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to ""kill myself"" and finding a suicide note.
   - Emotional indicators show intense hopelessness, despair, and anger (""really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more,"" ""I don't care"").
   - There is a reference to a suicide note that was found in the trash, which suggests some form of preparation or past action related to suicidal thoughts.
   - No specific methods or detailed plans are mentioned beyond the general desire to kill oneself, though there is a fleeting mention of wishing to ""shoot myself on the spot,"" which lacks context or preparation details.
   - No explicit mention of past attempts, only current feelings and thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""ruin their lives by killing myself"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""really wish I could shoot myself on the spot"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods or detailed plans are mentioned beyond the vague statement of wishing to ""shoot myself on the spot,"" which does not indicate preparation or access to means.
   - The suicide note mentioned was found in the trash, which could imply past preparation, but it is unclear if it relates to a current plan.
   - Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I wanna kill myself even more"").
   - There is no specific description of past attempts, only the discovery of a suicide note, which does not confirm a past action.
   - The focus is on current emotional state and desire to die.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die, which rules out 'indicator.'
   - There is no clear, specific plan or method described beyond a vague wish to ""shoot myself,"" and no concrete evidence of preparation for a current act, so 'behavior' is not the best fit.
   - There is no mention of a past concrete action or attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - The best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or past attempt.

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of overdose (""OD today"") and suicide (""thinking about suicide for a while now"").
   - Emotional indicators include numbness (""I can't feel anything right now"") and fixation on the idea (""it's all I can think about"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are mentioned: overdosing on a month's worth of specific medications (venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh, inderal).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current intentions (""Think I'm going to OD today"") and ongoing thoughts (""thinking about suicide for a while now"").
   - There are no specific descriptions of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan to overdose using identified medications with an immediate timeframe (""today""). This goes beyond ideation and fits the definition of 'behavior' due to the mention of a concrete method and intent to act.
   - Since there is no mention of past attempts, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - The explicit plan and means rule out 'indicator' and 'ideation'.

   - There is a vague expression of wanting ""the end,"" which could imply a desire to not be alive, but it is not a clear or direct statement of suicidal intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains strong emotional distress and a vague reference to ""the end,"" but lacks explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die.
   - As per the guidelines, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the classification should be 'indicator' over 'ideation,' even with significant hopelessness.
   - There is no mention of a plan or past attempt, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'indicator' due to the absence of explicit suicidal intent.

My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include the death of the user's grandpa, personal emotional reflection, and a past intention to kill themselves before Christmas.

   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - There is a reference to a past intention to commit suicide, but it is no longer current.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I was going to kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the past context, but the user now expresses a decision against it and an appreciation for life.
   - Since it is explicit but tied to a past intention with no current desire, I will evaluate further.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The mention of suicide refers to a past intention (""I was going to kill myself before Christmas""), and the user explicitly states they can’t do it now due to their mother’s grief.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of a concrete past action or attempt, only a past intention.
   - The current context shows a shift away from suicidal thoughts with an appreciation for life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions a past intention to commit suicide, which fits the definition of 'ideation' since there is no specific plan or method mentioned.
   - It does not fit 'behavior' as there is no plan or preparation described.
   - It does not fit 'attempt' as there is no description of a past concrete action or attempt, only a thought/intention.
   - It does not fit 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, even if in a past context.
   - Given the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts without a plan and the context being a past intention with a current shift away from it, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category.

I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy.

   - There is a direct expression of finding death ""beautiful"" and a desire to escape pain and hassle, which could imply a wish to not be alive, but it is not explicitly stated as wanting to die or commit suicide.
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation are evident.
   - Since there is no planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post does not refer to past events or past attempts; it seems to be a current reflection on the concept of death.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post lacks explicit mention of suicide or a clear desire to die, focusing instead on the abstract beauty of death and escape from pain. While there are emotional indicators of distress, the content does not cross into explicit suicidal ideation as defined by the criteria. There is no mention of a plan or past attempts. Therefore, 'indicator' fits best as per the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide are present: The user explicitly states, ""if I'm positive, I'll kill myself"" and discusses overcoming fear of death.
   - Emotional indicators include intense feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and despair: ""feeling like absolute shit,"" ""outcast,"" ""no one I can go to,"" ""tired,"" and ""no reason to live.""
   - Specific plans or methods: The user mentions a conditional plan to commit suicide if COVID results are positive, but no specific method or preparation is detailed beyond a general intent to use ""any method.""
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states, ""I'll kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a clear desire to not live if the COVID test is positive and mentions a lack of reasons to live.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no mentions of acquiring means, writing notes, or other concrete preparations.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or specific method, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and future intentions based on the COVID test results.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - While there is a conditional intent to commit suicide, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior.'

   - The post refers to a past action (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"") with the implication of intent to die, which suggests a past attempt.
   - There are also current expressions of wanting to die, but no specific current plans.
   - Since past attempts are described and current thoughts are mentioned, the rule states to classify as 'attempt' when both are present.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of suicide and desire to die rules out 'indicator'.
   - The lack of a specific current plan or method for suicide rules out 'behavior'.
   - The mention of a past concrete action (taking a bottle of zopiclone with implied intent to die) fits the definition of 'attempt'.

Now im sure that life is sending me the message that I should die. I'm not deserving of love or even fun. And life is right. I deserve to die and suffer while doing so. And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to ""kill myself"" and ""end myself on my birthday,"" indicating suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, such as ""life is shit,"" ""I deserve to die and suffer,"" and feeling undeserving of love or fun.
   - There is a specific timeline mentioned (""on my birthday in two weeks""), which suggests a potential plan or timeframe.
   - There is a reference to a past failed attempt in October, which is a significant historical context.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""end myself.""
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""I deserve to die"" and ""life is sending me the message that I should die.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific timeframe is mentioned (""on my birthday in two weeks""), but no specific method, tools, location, or means of suicide are described.
   - There are no signs of concrete preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes) mentioned in the post.
   - Since there is no explicit method or preparation detailed, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to both a past event (failed attempt in October) and current/future intentions (planning to end life on birthday in two weeks).
   - The past attempt is specifically mentioned as having occurred, which aligns with the 'attempt' category definition.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mentions of wanting to die and kill oneself clearly move this beyond 'indicator' to at least 'ideation.'
   - While there is a timeframe for the intended act (birthday in two weeks), the lack of a specific method or preparation means it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - The mention of a past failed attempt in October aligns with the 'attempt' category. Additionally, per the definition, even with current plans mentioned, the presence of a past attempt directs the classification to 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, despite the current ideation and vague future intent, the reference to a past attempt takes precedence as per the rules provided.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in the context of a past attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post explicitly states that suicidal thoughts are gone.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the past attempt is mentioned without details of method or preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of current planning or preparation for suicide.
   - Since there is no current plan or method described, this does not fit 'behavior'.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a past attempt is mentioned, though without specific details.
   - Focus is on historical action rather than current or future intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?

   - 'Ideation' does not fit because there are no current expressions of suicidal thoughts or desires to die; the post states these thoughts are gone.
   - 'Behavior' does not fit because there is no mention of a current plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - 'Attempt' fits best because the post explicitly refers to a past suicide attempt, and the category definition prioritizes historical actions even if current thoughts are not suicidal.

As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and dying are present, with explicit statements like ""I want to die or reverse time"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time.""
   - Emotional indicators include intense hopelessness, self-hatred, anger, and despair, as seen in phrases like ""I fucking hate myself"" and ""I literally don't want to eat.""
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The post describes imagining self-harm (amputating body parts, burning), but clarifies that the person has never purposely hurt themselves and is afraid of pain.
   - No references to past suicide attempts are made, though there is a mention of being hospitalized for depression in high school.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" is not used), but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""I want to die or reverse time"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day.""
   - Given the explicit desire to die, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator,' as the definition of ideation includes a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods or plans for suicide are mentioned. Imagining self-harm (amputation, burning) is noted, but there is no indication of intent to act on these thoughts, and the person states they are afraid of pain and have never hurt themselves.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and thoughts (""I think about dying every fucking day""), with no specific reference to future actions or plans.
   - Past events are mentioned (hospitalization for depression in high school), but there is no description of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and thinking about dying constantly, which aligns with the definition of 'ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings without a specific plan).
   - It does not fit 'indicator' because there are direct statements about wanting to die, beyond vague distress or hopelessness.
   - It does not fit 'behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - It does not fit 'attempt' because there is no reference to past suicide attempts, only past hospitalization for depression.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'ideation.'

   - Strong expressions of depression and exhaustion (""i'm so depressed"", ""everything is so exhausting"", ""my own body is giving up"").
   - A specific hope or desire to die (""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"").
   - No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm as a deliberate act, no specific plans or methods for ending life, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or direct phrases like ""kill myself"" are not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" indicates a desire to not be alive.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned as an act but there is a clear desire to die, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'indicator' based on the definition of ideation including explicit expressions of not wanting to live.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, dying in sleep is mentioned, but it is not a specific method or plan that the person is actively pursuing or preparing for; it is more of a passive hope.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no mentions of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and a future hope (""tonight""), not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not fit 'indicator' because there is a clear expression of wanting to die, even if suicide is not explicitly mentioned by name.
   - It fits 'ideation' because there is an explicit desire to not be alive (""hoping i will die in my sleep tonight""), but no specific plan or method is mentioned.
   - It does not fit 'behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.

   - Refers to a past action (taking pills at 11:30) and current state (feeling fine apart from nausea and sweating).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by term, but the phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" strongly implies a suicidal intent or desire to die. (Yes to direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive.)
   - Given the context of overdose and implied intent, this leans toward explicit suicidal intent rather than a vague indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific method is mentioned: overdose with Zoloft, including dosage (300mg).
   - The action has already been taken, so it’s beyond planning or preparation—it’s a completed act.
   - No current or future planning is mentioned beyond this event.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to a past event (taking pills at 11:30) and current state (feeling fine with nausea and sweating).
   - This describes a concrete past action of overdose with implied suicidal intent, fitting the definition of a past attempt.
   - No current or future intentions or plans are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - This post does not fit 'indicator' because there is an implied intent to die through the overdose and the statement ""wasn't enough to kill me.""
   - It goes beyond 'ideation' because it’s not just thoughts or desires but a concrete action taken (overdose).
   - It does not fit 'behavior' as defined, because 'behavior' focuses on current plans or preparations for suicide, and this post describes a past action without current planning.
   - It fits 'attempt' because it describes a past concrete action (overdose) with implied suicidal intent. The definition of 'attempt' focuses on historic actions, and even though no current plans are mentioned, the past attempt is clear.

At peace knowing it's soon. Hope my plan works though, there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of ""destined to do it"" and ""it's soon"" suggest a potential reference to ending their life, though not explicitly stated as suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include chronic stress, trauma, severe chronic fatigue syndrome, and a sense of calm/peace about a decision, which could imply resignation or acceptance of death.
   - There is a reference to a ""plan"" and a hope that it ""works,"" which could indicate preparation or intent, though specifics are not provided.
   - No mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not directly say ""suicide"" or ""killing myself."" The language is vague with phrases like ""destined to do it"" and ""it's soon.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through ""there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"" and the sense of finality in ""it's soon.""
   - Since it's not fully explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation,' but the implied intent and mention of a plan push me to consider further.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post only mentions a ""plan"" and hopes it ""works,"" but no tools, locations, or substances are specified.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Vague reference to a plan, but no concrete details like notes or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""it's soon,"" ""hope my plan works"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide, which leans toward 'indicator.' However, the strong implication of not wanting to live (""there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"") and the reference to a plan suggest suicidal thoughts.
   - Since there is no specific method or detailed plan mentioned, it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - There are no past attempts mentioned, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Given the explicit desire to not live and the vague reference to a plan, but lacking full clarity on suicide as the intent, I must adhere to the rule of choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit mention of suicide.

I can deal with difficulties in life but realizing you're hopeless is too much. I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better. I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Key elements include expressions of hopelessness and distress (""Hopeless. I've felt hopeless for months"").
   - There is a mention of seeking a ""suicide forum,"" which directly relates to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include deep despair and rejection of encouragement (""I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are present.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to seeking a ""suicide forum.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, there is no explicit statement of wanting to die or end their life, only a mention of seeking a forum related to suicide.
   - Since the mention of suicide is explicit but the desire to die is not clearly stated, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, seeking a forum does not constitute a specific plan or preparation like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if suicide ideation is confirmed, but I must first resolve the explicitness of suicidal intent.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post reflects current feelings of hopelessness and a current intention to find a suicide forum, not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide forum,"" which indicates a connection to suicide. However, the definition of 'ideation' requires an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive or to die, which is not present here. The user expresses hopelessness and distress but does not directly state a wish to end their life.
   - As per the guideline, if there is doubt about whether suicide was explicitly mentioned as a personal intent or desire, I must choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.' The mention of a ""suicide forum"" is explicit in terms of the word ""suicide,"" but it does not confirm personal suicidal thoughts or intent (e.g., it could imply seeking information or discussion rather than personal desire).
   - There is no plan or behavior mentioned, so 'behavior' is not applicable. There are no past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, despite the explicit mention of ""suicide forum,"" the lack of a clear personal desire to die or end life leans this toward 'indicator' based on the rule to err on the side of 'indicator' when in doubt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of self-harm and dying: The post explicitly states ""slash my wrists and die.""
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of despair, low self-worth (""I'm disgusting to look at""), hopelessness, and a desire for emotional support (""I just wanted my mother to tell me it'll be okay"").
   - Specific plans or methods: The post mentions ""slash my wrists"" as a method of self-harm with the intent to die.
   - References to past attempts: There are no mentions of past suicide attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""slash my wrists and die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post clearly states a desire to die (""just want an end"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slash my wrists"" is a specific method of self-harm with intent to die.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no mentions of acquiring means, writing notes, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is a specific method mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past attempts are mentioned.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""slash my wrists and die"") and a specific method (""slash my wrists""). While there are no clear signs of preparation, the mention of a specific method aligns with the definition of 'behavior' as it includes explicit planning in the form of a method.

I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone. ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a strong expression of hopelessness (""my life is not able to be fixed"") and a desire for death (""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone"").
   - Emotional indicators of despair and frustration are present (""bullshit phrase,"" feeling isolated in experiences).
   - There is a mention of preparing for death by fixing funeral costs, which suggests some level of planning or preparation.
   - No specific method of suicide is mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is absent), but there is a clear expression of wanting to die (""I cannot wait to die"").
   - Direct expression of wanting to die is present, which leans toward at least 'ideation' rather than 'indicator'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific method or means of suicide is mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances).
   - There is a mention of preparing funeral costs, which could be seen as a form of preparation, but it is not directly tied to a specific plan or act of suicide.
   - Since there is no explicit method or clear plan, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and a future desire for death (""I cannot wait to die""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are mentioned.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit desire to die, which rules out 'indicator'.
   - While there is a mention of preparing funeral costs, it does not constitute a specific plan or method for suicide, so 'behavior' may not fully apply. As per the rule, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.
   - No past attempts are described, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit expression of wanting to die without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of hopelessness and despair about the future (""life won't ever be as good again,"" ""destined to live a depressed life""). 
   - There is a vague existential question about the ""point"" of life, which could imply thoughts of not wanting to continue, but it is not explicit.
   - No direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. (No)
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. The post hints at a lack of purpose or hope but does not cross into explicit suicidal intent. (No)
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - Since there is no evidence of planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.

   - The post refers to the past (""summer of my life is over"") and current feelings of despair about the future, but there are no references to past suicide attempts or current/future suicidal intentions.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to die. As per the guidelines, even strong dissatisfaction with life and hopelessness falls under 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned. There is no plan or past attempt described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a mention of jumping from a bridge, which implies a method of suicide, and a desire for death (""highest chance of death""). 
   - Emotional indicators are present, such as a sense of hopelessness or resignation (""I doubt anyone will answer me"") and a fatalistic tone (""wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want"").
   - Specific plans are mentioned: jumping from a bridge in NYC, with a timeline of ""by the weekend.""
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly stated with words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but the intent to die is heavily implied through ""highest chance of death"" and choosing a bridge to jump from.
   - There is a direct expression of wanting a fatal outcome, even if not explicitly phrased as ""wanting to die."" Given the context, this leans toward explicit intent. However, per the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' if unclear, I note the ambiguity but consider the strong implication.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: jumping from a bridge.
   - A location is implied (NYC bridges), and a timeline is given (""by the weekend""), which suggests preparation or intent to act soon.
   - This appears to go beyond vague thoughts and into planning, but per the rule, if uncertain about explicit planning, I should lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.' However, the specificity of method and timeline seems clear.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a future intention (""by the weekend""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post does not fit 'indicator' because there is a clear implication of wanting a fatal outcome, even if ""suicide"" isn’t explicitly stated. However, per the guideline to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I reconsider. The intent seems strong enough to move past 'indicator.'
   - It fits 'ideation' due to the expression of a desire for death, but the mention of a specific method (jumping from a bridge) and timeline (""by the weekend"") pushes it toward 'behavior.'
   - It fits 'behavior' because of the explicit method and timeline, which suggest planning. Per the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure, I note the timeline and method are specific enough to classify as 'behavior.'
   - It does not fit 'attempt' as there is no mention of past actions.
   - Final reasoning: The specificity of the method (bridge jumping) and timeline (by the weekend) aligns with 'behavior' as it indicates planning beyond mere thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include feelings of being misunderstood, mistreatment by parents, and a deep sense of suffering and pain. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness (""I will never be free,"" ""the pain will never loosen its grip"") and despair (""I am here to live in pain,"" ""this is my destiny"").
   - There is a vague reference to death or dying with the statement ""I am convinced that I will never die,"" but it is not an explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Instead, it seems to express a feeling of being trapped in suffering.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. (No)
   - There is no direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive. The statement about ""never die"" seems to imply a sense of endless suffering rather than a desire for death. (No)

   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and pain, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. The vague reference to ""never die"" does not clearly indicate suicidal ideation but rather a feeling of being trapped in suffering.
   - As per the guidelines, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the classification should be 'indicator' even in the presence of strong dissatisfaction with life or hopelessness.
   - There are no plans or past attempts mentioned, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'indicator.'

I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide: The post explicitly discusses the concept of ending one's life, with phrases like ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" and ""the idea of that state lasting forever is hard to turn away from."" There is also a reference to a past aborted attempt at suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of pain, doubt, and a lack of excitement or motivation for life (""I'm neither particularly excited about nor put off by it""). There is a sense of hopelessness or resignation about the future.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The thoughts are more abstract and focused on the idea of ending life rather than how it would be done.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, the user mentions an ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" and notes being thankful it did not succeed at the time.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post explicitly talks about ending one's life and the appeal of a permanent end.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" and the appeal of a permanent state of sleep.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Not unclear; suicide and the desire to not be alive are explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to end life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of actions like writing notes or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no uncertainty; no plan or preparation is mentioned, so 'ideation' is more appropriate than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to both a past attempt (""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"") and current thoughts about not wanting to continue living or finding an end appealing.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a past attempt is mentioned, though not in detail beyond it being ""aborted"" and unsuccessful.
   - Note: Per the rules, if a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans or thoughts, it should still be classified as 'attempt'. However, 'attempt' is defined as focusing on historic actions, and in this case, current ideation is prominent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - Indicator: Not applicable, as suicide and the desire to not be alive are explicitly mentioned.
   - Ideation: Fits due to explicit expressions of wanting to end life or not be alive (""welcome end to everything"") without any specific plan or method mentioned.
   - Behavior: Not applicable, as there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - Attempt: While a past attempt is mentioned, the post also focuses heavily on current thoughts of wanting to end life. Per the definition, 'attempt' is for historic actions, but the rule states to label as 'attempt' if past attempts and current plans are mentioned. However, since no current plan is specified (only thoughts), and 'attempt' focuses on past actions, I lean toward 'ideation' for the current suicidal thoughts. Upon re-evaluation of the rule (""if a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'""), I note that current ""plans"" are not mentioned—only thoughts. Thus, I must decide between 'ideation' for current thoughts and 'attempt' for past action with current context. Given the emphasis on current feelings in the post, 'ideation' may still apply, but the rule suggests prioritizing 'attempt' when past attempts are mentioned alongside current suicidal content.
   - Final decision: Given the explicit rule to classify as 'attempt' when past attempts are mentioned alongside current suicidal thoughts or plans (even if plans are not specific), I will classify this as 'attempt'. However, upon double-checking, the definition of 'attempt' focuses on historic actions, and 'ideation' fits the current explicit thoughts without plans. I will adhere to the rule as stated and classify as 'attempt' due to the past attempt and current suicidal ideation being present.
   - Correction: Re-reading the rule: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Since no current ""plans"" are mentioned (only thoughts), the rule may not fully apply. However, to be cautious and align with the intent of capturing past attempts as a significant risk factor, I will classify as 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of hopelessness and despair are evident with phrases like ""there's no hope anymore,"" ""no joy anymore,"" and ""no emotion anymore.""
   - Emotional indicators include numbness and a sense of futility (""no matter how hard I struggle... it doesn't matter"").
   - There is a specific mention of a plan with the phrase ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess,"" which suggests a method and consideration of location for a suicidal act.
   - No references to past attempts are made; the focus seems to be on current or future intentions.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by name, but the intent is implied with ""I plan on doing it"" in the context of hopelessness and an apology to loved ones, suggesting a desire to end life.
   - There is an indirect expression of wanting to die with ""it's for the best,"" indicating a belief that ending life is a solution.
   - Since it is not explicitly stated as ""suicide"" or ""killing myself,"" I consider the context and lean toward a stronger interpretation due to the planning detail.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method or location is mentioned: ""in the tub, there will be less of a mess,"" which implies a planned act with consideration of minimizing impact.
   - There are signs of preparation in the form of an apology (""I'm sorry to those who cared about me""), which could be interpreted as a farewell note or emotional preparation.
   - The mention of a specific location and method pushes this beyond vague ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current or future intentions with ""I plan on doing it,"" not past events.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - This post goes beyond 'indicator' because there is an implied intent to end life, even if ""suicide"" is not explicitly stated.
   - It also goes beyond 'ideation' because there is a specific mention of a plan (""in the tub"") and consideration of minimizing mess, which indicates a method and preparation.
   - It does not fit 'attempt' as there is no mention of past actions.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category due to the explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a specific plan.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: There is no mention of a specific method, location, or preparation for ending their life. The user talks about past struggles with addiction to painkillers and antidepressants, and current issues with starvation, but these are not framed as a plan for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: There is no mention of any past suicide attempts. The post focuses on current feelings and past traumas but does not indicate a specific historical action of attempting suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""wanting to end it"" are clear references to suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user directly expresses a desire to ""end it,"" indicating a wish to not be alive.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of preparations like writing notes or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since there is no plan or method mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""wanting to end it""), which rules out 'indicator.'
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide, which rules out 'behavior.'
   - There is no reference to a past suicide attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation,' as it reflects explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

255,"I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts until my parents made me break up with my boyfriend. He was everything to me. I loved him so much. He was so perfect. My parents found out I have been talking to him online and told me they don't want me talking to him ever again. They also don't trust me anymore and keep on asking what I'm doing on my phone. I really want to fucking kill myself. Not only did I lose my boyfriend, I lost the respect of my parents and I lost my respect for them. I have no one. I was getting over my suicidal thoughts when I was with him, but now they're coming back. I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past thoughts and a reference to self-harm are mentioned, not a concrete past attempt.

If I am forced to live then put me on a thorazine dri0 so I can be a zombie until the world lets me die.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

   - Specific mentions of suicide and past attempts are present, along with a desire to kill oneself (""my body, my choice means I should be able to kill myself"").
   - No specific current plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned in the post. References to altering reality and medication are noted but not tied to a specific suicide plan.
   - Past attempts are explicitly mentioned, including one described as ""most successful"" where the person was saved.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances for a current suicide plan are mentioned.
   - No signs of current preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident in the post.

   - Past attempts are specifically described (""most successful attempt involved me being saved"").
   - There is a focus on historical actions (past attempts) alongside current ideation, but no current plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of past suicide attempts aligns with the 'attempt' category, as it describes concrete historical actions.
   - While there are strong current expressions of wanting to die, there is no mention of a specific current plan or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - Per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current thoughts (even without plans), it should still be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'attempt' due to the explicit description of past suicide attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death/suicide: The post explicitly mentions ""trying to kill myself"" multiple times and expresses a clear intent to end their life.
   - Emotional indicators: There is profound hopelessness, despair, guilt, anger, shame, and a sense of worthlessness (""I'm such a fucking loser"").
   - Specific plans or methods: The user mentions trying again with a ""different method"" that is ""much easier and not so easy to back out of"" unless they go to the hospital or their ""math is off."" While the exact method isn't named, there is an implication of planning and calculation.
   - References to past attempts: The post implies past attempts with phrases like ""failing"" and ""trying to end my own life,"" though no specific past actions (e.g., overdose) are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states ""trying to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user repeatedly expresses a desire to end their life.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this cannot be classified as 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not exactly; the user mentions a ""different method"" that is easier and harder to back out of, with a reference to ""math"" being off, which suggests some form of planning or calculation, but no specific tool, location, or substance is named.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are hints of preparation (e.g., considering a method and timing like ""tomorrow maybe""), but it remains vague.
   - Since the plan is not fully explicit (no specific means or location), I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rule to choose 'ideation' when unsure about explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to both past experiences (""failing"") and current/future intentions (""I'm going to try again"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no concrete description of a past action (e.g., overdose); it’s implied but not detailed.
   - Since past attempts are not concretely described, and there is a focus on future intent, 'attempt' may not be the best fit.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post cannot be 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - It fits 'ideation' due to the clear expression of wanting to die and repeated mentions of trying to kill themselves.
   - While there is a vague reference to a ""different method"" and timing, the lack of a specific plan (e.g., no mention of a particular tool or location) suggests it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior.' As per the rule, when unsure about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - It does not fit 'attempt' because there is no concrete description of a past suicide attempt, only implied failure.
   - Therefore, the best classification is 'ideation' since the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without a clear, specific plan.

   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the term ""suicide"" or direct phrases like ""kill myself"" are not used. However, ""end it"" strongly suggests a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""All I want is courage to end it"" indicates a desire to end life.
   - Since ""suicide"" is not explicitly stated but the intent is clear, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'indicator' due to the strong implication of wanting to die.

   - There is no reference to past attempts, so it does not qualify as 'attempt.'
   - Given the explicit expression of wanting to end life without a plan, the best fit is 'ideation.' Although the rules suggest leaning toward 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the clear intent behind ""end it"" aligns more closely with 'ideation.'

261,"Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me. I just can't do this anymore, all the upset and pain and hurt I cause. I have to make it stop.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the statement ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me,"" which suggests a belief that their absence would benefit others. The phrases ""I just can't do this anymore"" and ""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause"" indicate deep emotional distress, hopelessness, and possibly guilt. The statement ""I have to make it stop"" is vague but implies a desire to end the current situation, potentially hinting at self-harm or suicide.
   - Mentions of death or suicide are not explicit, but the language strongly implies a wish to no longer exist or cause pain.
   - Emotional indicators include despair, hopelessness, and guilt.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are present.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No direct reference to ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"").
   - There is a direct expression of not wanting to be around or a belief that others would be better off without them, which can be interpreted as a desire to not be alive (Yes, indirect but present).
   - Since it is not entirely clear and explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I just can't do this anymore,"" ""I have to make it stop""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress and a potential desire to not exist (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me""), which borders on suicidal ideation. However, since suicide or killing oneself is not explicitly mentioned, and the guideline instructs to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt, this post fits best under 'indicator'. There is no mention of a specific plan or past attempt, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable.

263,"Ramble about hating myself. Just joined but I have a problem. I'm a 30 year old Male single parent of a 7 about to be 8 year old son. I can afford my bills (barely) but we have food and a roof over our head. But even before he was born I have had depression. I'm sure his mom cheating on me and leaving us 4 years ago didn't help. ( Not doctor diagnosed but I assume do to always been looking at things as glass being empty and not wanting to live.) Now as I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life. Of course I will wait till he's an adult but I just can't seem to get my life together. Every job I have ever wanted I can't get because my experience is in different fields. Females don't like me because of the dad bod. I feel I'm at the point of just no success. I'm over being a failure. But I don't have motivation. I have tried but i just feel like a waste of space. This thing called a life is too much. I would say I'm suicidal but I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that. 11 more years then yes I could be there but for now he just has a non successful dad that he is probably ashamed of. How do I deal with the pain of life. I feel like I'm a failure to my son, my parents, and everyone around me. Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?

   - Emotional indicators include depression, hopelessness, feeling like a failure, lack of motivation, and feeling like a waste of space.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states, ""I would say I'm suicidal but I don't have the balls to actually do it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""not wanting to live"" and ""comfortable with leaving this life.""
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans away from 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not fit 'behavior.'
   - There are no references to past attempts, so it does not fit 'attempt.'

264,I'm struggling to hold on. Male 25. Been depressed and feeling like shit for years &amp; years. Struggling to hold on I just want off this life. Not sure who I'm talking to or why,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of struggle, long-term depression, and a desire to escape life (""I just want off this life"").
   - Emotional indicators: Clear signs of despair and hopelessness (""struggling to hold on,"" ""feeling like shit for years"").
   - No mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide.
   - No references to past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (no direct reference to ""suicide,"" ""killing myself,"" or similar terms).
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to escape life (""I just want off this life""), which suggests a desire to not be alive, though it remains somewhat vague.
   - Since it is unclear and not explicitly about suicide, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - Since there is no planning or method, 'behavior' is not applicable.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and struggles, not past events or future intentions beyond a vague desire to escape life.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress and a vague desire to not be alive (""want off this life""), but lacks explicit mention of suicide or suicidal intent.
   - As per the guideline, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned, I should choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.'
   - There is no plan or method mentioned, so 'behavior' does not apply.
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, despite the strong emotional distress, the lack of explicit suicide mention leads me to classify this as 'indicator.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of being ""gone"" by next week, which could imply death or suicide.
   - Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are strong (""no possible way to turn my life around,"" ""no point in trying,"" ""tired of fighting"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned; the term ""gone"" is vague and could imply death but is not a direct reference to suicide.
   - There is a direct expression of hopelessness and giving up, but not a clear statement of wanting to die or commit suicide. The intent behind ""gone"" is ambiguous.
   - Since it is unclear, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable. If there is any doubt, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but the lack of explicit suicide mention leans toward 'indicator.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness, with a vague reference to being ""gone,"" but lacks explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. As per the guidelines, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the classification should be 'indicator' even with strong dissatisfaction or hopelessness. There is no specific plan or mention of past attempts, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable. Given the ambiguity of ""gone"" and the rule to lean toward 'indicator' when in doubt, the best fit is 'indicator.'

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if current intent is the focus.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, though not in detail, the user mentions a previous attempt.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned for current suicidal thoughts, which suggests 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - However, the mention of a past attempt (""another attempt"") aligns with the 'attempt' category. According to the rules, if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans or thoughts, it should still be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Given the explicit reference to a past attempt combined with current suicidal thoughts, 'attempt' is the most appropriate category.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide are present, with specific references to past events involving suicidal actions.
   - Emotional indicators include struggle, confusion, and distress about past actions (""it's pretty fucked,"" ""genuinely bothered me afterwards"").
   - Specific methods or actions are described: ""testing my method,"" ""went until shortly before the point of no return,"" and ""went in with the intention of dying.""
   - References to past events are clear, with two specific incidents described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly discusses suicidal actions and intentions.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, particularly in the second event where the intention was to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, there is mention of a ""method"" and actions taken to test it, as well as going to a critical point before stopping.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly current preparation, but past actions involved deliberate steps toward testing a method and intending to die.
   - Since the events are in the past, this leans toward historical context rather than current planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past events (""both of these happened long enough ago,"" ""past year or two"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, two specific incidents are described, one with the intent to die and the other as testing a method, both involving concrete actions (going to a critical point and stopping).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and describes past actions with intent to die in at least one instance.
   - Since these are historical events involving concrete actions (not just thoughts), and the definition of 'attempt' includes past actions taken toward suicide, this fits the 'attempt' category.
   - There is no current plan or preparation mentioned for future actions, so it does not fit 'behavior.'
   - Although there is emotional struggle, the focus on past specific actions with intent overrides 'indicator' or 'ideation.'

Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide: The post explicitly mentions ""contemplating suicide"" and expresses a desire for the ""nightmare to be over"" through actions like jumping in front of a car or stabbing oneself.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of despair, hopelessness, and frustration are evident with phrases like ""depression ruined a great life,"" ""fucking hell,"" ""never ending pit,"" and ""nightmare.""
   - Specific plans or methods: The post mentions specific methods such as ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself.""
   - References to past attempts: There are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself so this nightmare could all be over.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies methods like jumping in front of a car and stabbing oneself.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of concrete preparations such as acquiring means or writing notes; it appears to be a wish or contemplation rather than active planning.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': While methods are mentioned, the language (""I wish I had the courage"") suggests a lack of immediate intent or preparation, leaning toward ideation. However, the explicit mention of methods pushes this closer to 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and hypothetical future actions (""I wish I had the courage"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It includes specific methods (jumping in front of a car, stabbing oneself), which aligns with 'behavior' as it mentions a plan, even if briefly.
   - However, the phrasing ""I wish I had the courage"" suggests it may not be an immediate or concrete plan, creating some uncertainty. Per the rule, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.' Despite this, the explicit mention of methods leans toward 'behavior.'
   - There are no past attempts mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit methods mentioned, 'behavior' seems the most fitting category, but I must adhere to the guideline of choosing 'ideation' if there is uncertainty about a concrete plan. Since the methods are specific but the intent is framed as a wish rather than a definitive plan, I will lean toward 'ideation.'
   - Re-evaluating the definitions: 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" Here, specific methods are mentioned, but no preparations are evident. However, the definition includes mentioning a method as sufficient for 'behavior.' I will classify it as 'behavior' due to the explicit methods.
   - Final check: The rule states to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure. Given the lack of preparation and the ""wish"" framing, I reconsider, but the explicit methods mentioned make 'behavior' more accurate as per the definition.
   - Upon final reflection, I note that 'behavior' definition includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide,"" and specific methods qualify as a plan. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of not wanting to be here anymore, wanting to ""leave and never come back,"" and wishing for death via a nuclear bomb.
   - Strong emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, anger, and frustration (""I'm so fucking done with this shit,"" ""I hate this so much,"" ""disappointment and failure"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used).
   - However, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all"").
   - Since the mention of suicide is not very explicit (no direct reference to personal intent to commit suicide), but there is a clear desire to not be alive, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'indicator' as the expressions are strong and direct about not wanting to live.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned for personal suicide (the nuclear bomb reference is a general wish, not a personal plan or actionable method).
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - Since there is no explicit planning, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and desires (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad"").
   - No mention of past attempts or historical actions.
   - Focus is on current emotional state, not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not fit 'indicator' because there are direct expressions of not wanting to be alive, which go beyond vague distress or general hopelessness.
   - The post fits 'ideation' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method for suicide.
   - It does not fit 'behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
   - It does not fit 'attempt' because there is no reference to past suicide attempts.

   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die. (Yes)
   - No ambiguity here; it’s a clear statement of intent.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""pull the trigger""), which indicates a means of suicide involving a firearm.
   - No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun or writing a note) are mentioned, but the method is clear.
   - Since a method is explicitly stated, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current or future intentions (""I’m just going to pull the trigger""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to die""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - The mention of a specific method (""pull the trigger"") suggests a plan, which aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Based on the explicit mention of a method, 'behavior' is the most fitting category, as it meets the criteria of suicidal thoughts with a plan.

And at work my forearms with my wounds are visible for everyone to notice but they just say thinks like work faster, go to bed earlier( sleeping is really hard and I'm tired all the time). I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness. Death seems like the only place where I can be free.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death: Yes, the post states ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free,"" indicating a connection to death as an escape.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, and frustration are evident. The user feels uncared for, tired of pretending to be okay, and exhausted.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods, plans, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The reference to death is vague and not tied to a concrete action or method.
   - References to past attempts: The user mentions self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago""), but it is unclear if this was a suicide attempt or general self-harm. It is not explicitly described as an attempt to end their life.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not directly mention suicide or killing oneself. The reference to death is more abstract (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement about death being a place of freedom implies a desire to escape life, but it is not a clear or direct statement of wanting to die or commit suicide.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and the reference to death is somewhat vague, I will lean toward 'indicator' as per the guideline.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any specific way to end their life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since there is no planning or method mentioned, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post mentions past self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"") and current feelings of despair and thoughts of death as an escape.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The self-harm incident is mentioned, but it is not explicitly described as a suicide attempt. It could be interpreted as general self-harm rather than an attempt to die.
   
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or a clear desire to commit suicide, though it does express a vague connection to death as freedom. As per the guideline, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The emotional distress and hopelessness are strong, but without a direct mention of suicide or wanting to die, it falls under 'indicator'. There is no specific plan or method, so 'behavior' is not applicable. The past self-harm is not clearly a suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is also not applicable.

275,"More than anything I want help and to get better, but I can't tell anyone. I just moved out of home, I live on campus now. I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know?

I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much.

I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide: The user explicitly talks about feeling suicidal, thinking about suicide every day, and seriously considering it weekly. They also mention writing detailed plans in a journal and having conversations about suicide in the journal.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user mentions writing ""detailed plans"" in their journal, but no specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are described in the post itself.
   - References to past attempts: There are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states they feel suicidal, think about it daily, and seriously consider it weekly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses suicidal thoughts and feelings, though they also state they would ""never do it"" due to fear of going to hell.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, while the user mentions writing ""detailed plans"" in a journal, no specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are provided in the post.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No concrete signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are mentioned beyond writing plans in a journal, which remains vague in this context.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no specific plan or method is detailed in the post, this leans toward 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings and thoughts about suicide, with no reference to past attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and feelings, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - While the user mentions writing ""detailed plans"" in a journal, no specific methods or preparations are described in the post itself, and the user states they would ""never do it"" due to religious fears. Per the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain about explicit planning, this fits 'ideation'.
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'ideation' due to explicit suicidal thoughts without a clear, specific plan or behavior described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post expresses distress but does not mention a desire to die or end life.
   - Since it is unclear and lacks explicit mention of suicide, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post lacks explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die, focusing instead on general distress and pain. As per the guidelines, even significant hopelessness or dissatisfaction with life falls under 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, this post fits the 'indicator' category.

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include an explicit mention of ""committing suicide,"" which directly refers to ending one's life.
   - Emotional indicators are not deeply detailed, but the context implies a serious tone with the mention of being ""capable"" of committing suicide.
   - There is no mention of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances are referenced).
   - There are no references to past attempts; the focus seems to be on a current or hypothetical capability.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly states ""committing suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the mention of being ""capable of committing suicide"" implies a consideration or readiness to end one's life, even if not an immediate intent.
   - Since it is explicit, it moves beyond 'indicator.'

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and implies a readiness or capability to commit suicide, which aligns with expressing suicidal thoughts or feelings.
   - However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'ideation,' as it fits the definition of explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of emotional distress: ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" ""sick and tired.""
   - Expressions of wanting life to end: ""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I just want it to be over,"" ""I want to be done.""
   - No explicit mention of suicide, death, or self-harm.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post does not directly reference suicide or killing oneself.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through phrases like ""I just want it to be over"" and ""I want to be done,"" which suggest a desire to not continue living, though not explicitly stated as wanting to die.
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of past suicide attempts (""I have attempted suicide 11 times"") and a future intention to use suicide as a means to disturb others (""I will use my suicide to disturb people"").
   - Emotional indicators include anger and dissatisfaction (""I hate capitalism and everyone complicit in it""), but the focus is on suicidal content.
   - There is a reference to future intent, but no specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for the future act.
   - Past attempts are explicitly mentioned and described in terms of frequency.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes).
   - There is a direct expression of intent to use suicide in the future, though not necessarily a personal desire to die (Yes, interpreted as suicidal intent).
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned for the future act.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described for the future intent.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method for the future act, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' for current thoughts, but past attempts are clearly stated.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to both past events (11 past suicide attempts) and future intentions (""I will use my suicide"").
   - Past attempts are specifically described in terms of number, which fits the 'attempt' category.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of past suicide attempts (11 times) clearly fits the 'attempt' category, as it describes historic actions.
   - The future intent (""I will use my suicide"") lacks a specific plan or method, which would typically classify as 'ideation' if considered alone.
   - Per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current/future plans or thoughts, it should be labeled as 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'attempt' due to the clear reference to past actions, overriding the future ideation component.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past attempts (""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"") and current emotional pain with a desire for it to end, but no current or future plans are specified.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, past attempts are mentioned, though not in detail regarding methods.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'attempt' category definition (""content describes past attempts at suicide"").
   - There are also current expressions of wanting the pain to end, which could suggest 'ideation', but the mention of past attempts takes precedence as per the rule: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"". Although no current plans are mentioned, the definition prioritizes past attempts for this category.
   - No specific current plans or methods are mentioned, so 'behavior' is not applicable.

I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and dying are present, with specific references to suicide methods (shotgun, handgun, overdose) and fear of failed attempts.
   - Emotional indicators include extreme hopelessness, despair, loneliness, depression, anxiety, and physical pain.
   - Specific plans or methods are discussed, such as shooting through the upper palate with a handgun, considering caliber differences, and referencing overdose with consequences like paralysis.
   - No explicit mention of past attempts, though there is a fear of failed attempts leading to worse outcomes.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly discusses suicide methods and the fear of failing at an attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post includes phrases like ""End it now"" and expresses a desire to escape unending pain, implying a wish to die.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this moves beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post mentions shotguns, handguns (with details about shooting through the upper palate and caliber considerations), and overdose (referencing Mark Linkous’s case).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly (e.g., no mention of acquiring means or writing notes), but the detailed consideration of methods and outcomes suggests active thought about planning.
   - Since specific methods are discussed in detail, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current thoughts and fears about suicide, with no specific description of past attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only a fear of failed attempts is mentioned, not a personal history of attempts.
   - The focus is on current ideation and potential planning, not past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post goes beyond 'indicator' due to explicit mentions of suicide and desire to die.
   - It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because specific methods (handgun, shotgun, overdose) are discussed with detailed considerations (caliber, shooting location, consequences of failure).
   - It fits 'behavior' as there are explicit suicidal thoughts combined with mentions of specific methods, even if preparation isn’t fully confirmed. Per the rule, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but the level of detail here (e.g., upper palate shooting, caliber discussion) strongly suggests planning.
   - It does not fit 'attempt' as there is no mention of past actions or attempts by the poster.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category due to the explicit suicidal thoughts paired with detailed method discussions.

   - Given the mention of a plan and specifics like timing and location, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current thoughts and future intentions (""I know where I'll attempt,"" ""It must be a Tuesday"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past actions or attempts.
   - The focus is on current ideation and planning, not historical events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond mere thoughts of suicide ('ideation') because it includes references to a specific plan, including knowing where, how, when (Tuesday), and what is needed, as well as an intention to run away from home.
   - While the exact method or tools are not detailed (e.g., no mention of specific weapons or substances), the mention of a concrete plan with timing and location details aligns with the definition of 'behavior' (explicit thoughts plus planning).
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Per the rules, if unsure about explicit planning, lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.' However, the specificity of timing (""Tuesday"") and other planning elements (""run away from home,"" ""know where I'll attempt"") provide enough evidence for 'behavior.'

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out? I want to be done, I want to be out of this and I wish I could just sleep for now but I can't. I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible.

I just want connection. I can't take this anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of loneliness, pain from isolation, and a direct mention of ""thinking about killing myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: profound loneliness, despair, and frustration (""What the fuck is wrong with me?"", ""I can't take this anymore"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly states ""thinking about killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement implies a desire to not be alive.
   - Since it is explicit, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit mention of suicidal thoughts (""thinking about killing myself"") but lacks any specific plan or method for suicide. There is no mention of past attempts. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation' as it expresses a desire to not be alive without a concrete plan. It is not just an 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and it is not 'behavior' due to the absence of planning or preparation. It is also not 'attempt' as there is no reference to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or dying: The post mentions wanting the situation to stop by ""crashing into another car"" and expresses a fear of not dying on impact.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of anxiety, sadness, and hopelessness about a ""pointless situation.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post describes a method of crashing into another car as a way to end the situation, though it also mentions hesitation due to fear of surviving with pain.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts, only current thoughts and fears.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there is a clear implication of wanting to end the situation through a fatal crash.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post implies a desire for the situation to end through death by crashing, though it is not explicitly stated as ""wanting to die."" Given the instruction to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I note the ambiguity but recognize the strong implication.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, crashing into another car is mentioned as a method to end the situation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring means or setting a specific time/place); the post describes a recurring thought or urge but also hesitation (""frequently come close to doing it but never can"").
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The method is mentioned, but the lack of concrete action or preparation suggests this may not fully meet the threshold for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and recurring thoughts of crashing, not past actions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly use the term ""suicide,"" but it strongly implies a desire to end the situation through a fatal act (crashing into another car). Per the rules, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I should lean toward 'indicator.' However, the mention of a specific method (crashing) suggests a potential for 'behavior.' Given the instruction to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure about explicit planning, and considering the lack of concrete preparation or action, 'ideation' seems more appropriate than 'behavior.' But the primary rule of leaning toward 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned takes precedence here, as the post does not directly state ""suicide"" or ""wanting to die.""
   - Final consideration: The rules emphasize that the mention of suicide must be very explicit to move beyond 'indicator.' Since it is not explicitly stated, despite the strong implication, I will classify this as 'indicator.'

   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die. (Yes)
   - No ambiguity here; it's a clear statement.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods are mentioned (e.g., no mention of how or where it would happen).

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include the mention of ""death"" as an option and questioning whether thinking about death as an option is considered a suicidal thought.
   - Emotional indicators suggest a passive acceptance of death (""not the worst outcome"") rather than active despair or hopelessness.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are present.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned; the post refers to ""death"" and an accidental death scenario, not a deliberate act of suicide.
   - There is no direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive; the user explicitly states ""I won't commit.""
   - Since it is unclear and lacks explicit mention of suicide, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation are evident.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'ideation' would be considered over 'behavior' if suicidal thoughts were present, but the lack of explicit intent leans toward 'indicator.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a hypothetical future scenario (accidental death) rather than current or past intentions.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post lacks explicit mention of suicide or a desire to end one's life. The user contemplates death as an option in a passive, hypothetical sense and explicitly states they would not commit suicide. While there is a vague reference to death not being the worst outcome, it does not meet the threshold for 'ideation' as there is no clear expression of wanting to die. Therefore, 'indicator' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to ""kill me,"" indicating a clear intent to end their life.
   - Emotional indicators are present with the statement ""I wish I didn’t have to do this,"" suggesting distress or conflict, but the intent remains clear.
   - Specific plans or preparations are mentioned with ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"" and a timeline of ""tonight is the last chance,"" indicating urgency and planning.

   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die with the intent to act on it tonight. (Yes)
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are not detailed (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or substances), but ""stuff prepared"" implies some form of preparation.
   - There are signs of preparation with ""stuff prepared"" and a timeline of ""tonight,"" which suggests concrete steps have been taken.
   - Although the method is not explicitly stated, the mention of preparation and urgency leans toward planning.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current/future intentions with ""tonight"" and a year-long plan leading to this moment.
   - There are no mentions of past attempts; it is focused on the present plan.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of wanting to ""kill me"" rules out 'indicator.'
   - The presence of a timeline (""tonight"") and preparation (""stuff prepared"") suggests more than just thoughts, leaning toward a plan, even if the method isn’t detailed.
   - Given the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure about explicit planning, I initially considered 'ideation.' However, the mention of preparation and a specific time frame (""tonight"") indicates some level of planning beyond mere thoughts.
   - Since there is no mention of a past attempt, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Weighing the evidence, the mention of preparation and a specific time frame aligns more with 'behavior' than 'ideation,' as it goes beyond vague thoughts to actionable intent.

I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself.

   - There are references to past thoughts of ""doing it,"" but no concrete past actions or attempts are described.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned; the phrase ""doing it"" and wishing to not be alive are strong indicators but not direct mentions of suicide or killing oneself.
   - There are direct expressions of wanting to not be alive and wishing things were over, which lean toward suicidal ideation.
   - Since ""suicide"" is not explicitly stated and the language is somewhat vague, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the rule.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.

   - However, since no specific method or concrete plan for the act itself is mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline (""if unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current thoughts and feelings (""I'm depressed and suicidal"", ""still wanting to die"").

311,"I want to help my suicidal online friend who has been through literal hell but I don't know how and I'm scared. I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks. Sorry for the post that is all over the place I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide and multiple suicide attempts are present, but they refer to the poster's online friend, not the poster themselves.
   - Emotional indicators include fear, confusion, and distress about the friend's situation, as well as the poster having a breakdown over it.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned regarding the poster themselves.
   - References to past attempts are made, but again, these are about the friend, not the poster.
   - The poster mentions being suicidal themselves but does not elaborate on this with any explicit thoughts, plans, or past actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned regarding the poster? Yes, but only in passing (""I'm suicidal myself"") without any further detail or expression of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive from the poster? No, the focus is on the friend's struggles, and the poster’s mention of being suicidal is vague and lacks explicit intent or desire.
   - Since the mention is unclear and not detailed, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' for the poster.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned by the poster about themselves? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances related to the poster’s own suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there signs of preparation by the poster? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions by the poster.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or detail, I will choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' or 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions for the poster? The poster’s mention of being suicidal is current but lacks specificity or detail about past or future actions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described for the poster? No, there are no descriptions of past attempts by the poster themselves.
   - The focus on suicide attempts and ideation is entirely on the friend, not the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does mention the poster being suicidal, but it lacks explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or any specific plans or past attempts by the poster. The primary content revolves around concern for a friend’s suicidal behavior and attempts.
   - Per the important rule, the suicide risk classification only corresponds to the person writing the post, not others mentioned.
   - Given the vague and passing mention of the poster’s own suicidal feelings without detail, and following the guideline to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt, this post best fits the 'indicator' category. There is distress and a general mention of being suicidal, but no explicit suicidal thoughts or plans are expressed by the poster.

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned with terms like ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself.""
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die, as seen in the utilitarian reasoning for ending their life and questioning the worth of their existence.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances).
   - No signs of preparation are evident (e.g., no notes or acquiring means).

   - It mentions a specific method (gun), which initially suggests 'behavior', but there is no evidence of a concrete plan or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note, or choosing a location). The mention of a gun is more hypothetical due to the inability to access one.
   - Per the guideline, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

318,"""your not cutting your faking it!"" stares at my arm motherfuckerly. Im tired of all the people who miraculously believe that im either cutting for attention or faking it. I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of self-harm (cutting) are present, with specific references to past incidents of cutting and visible scars.
   - Emotional indicators include feeling numb, empty, tired of disbelief from others, and crying oneself to sleep, suggesting distress and pain.
   - No explicit mentions of suicide, death, or dying. The post focuses on self-harm and the social repercussions of it.
   - No specific plans or methods for suicide are mentioned, nor are there references to preparations for ending one’s life.
   - Past self-harm is described, including a specific incident a few months ago when the writer cut themselves while their girlfriend was out.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, there is a vague statement like “some days I wonder if it’s even worth it anymore,” but it does not explicitly express a desire to die or commit suicide.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned for suicide? No, only past self-harm (cutting) is discussed, not suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation for suicide? No, there are no mentions of notes, acquiring means, or planning related to ending one’s life.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or mention of suicide methods, I would not classify this as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to past self-harm events (a few months ago) and current emotional distress due to social judgment.
   - Are past attempts at suicide specifically described? No, only past self-harm (cutting) is described, not a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die, only self-harm and emotional distress. As per the guidelines, even significant distress or hopelessness without explicit mention of suicide falls under 'indicator.'
   - There are no current plans or methods for suicide mentioned, so 'behavior' does not apply.
   - While past self-harm is described, it is not a past suicide attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - The vague statement about wondering if it’s worth it does not meet the threshold for 'ideation' since there is no explicit expression of wanting to die or commit suicide.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'indicator' as the post lacks explicit suicidal content.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is an explicit mention of ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - Emotional indicators include a ""depressive spell,"" feeling like they are ""spiraling worse,"" and references to bipolar 1 symptoms and lack of coping mechanisms.

   - There is no reference to past attempts at suicide.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses having suicidal thoughts, though they also state they do not think they are a danger to themselves at this point.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of preparations such as writing notes or acquiring means.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?

Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of hoping to die soon (""I hope I die soon"") and a strong desire for death (""Soon I will be finally dead"").
   - Emotional indicators show despair, anger, and hopelessness, especially regarding family and forced medication.
   - There is mention of heroin use daily, which could be harmful, but no specific plan or method for suicide is described.
   - No references to past suicide attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" is not used), but there are explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead""). As per the guideline, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. However, the desire to die is very clear here.
   - Given the explicit desire to die, this leans toward 'ideation' despite the lack of the word ""suicide.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods for suicide are mentioned (heroin use is noted but not explicitly tied to a plan to end life).
   - No signs of preparation for suicide (e.g., notes, acquiring specific means for suicide) are evident.
   - As per the guideline, if uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no plan, so 'behavior' is not applicable.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die, which fits the definition of 'ideation' (desire to not be alive without a specific plan).
   - Although the word ""suicide"" is not used, the intent is clear, and 'ideation' seems more appropriate than 'indicator' given the strength of the statements.
   - There is no specific plan or method for suicide mentioned, so 'behavior' does not apply.
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Based on the definitions and guidelines, 'ideation' is the best fit.

321,"What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem. I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a specific question about the position of a gun to hit the brain stem, which directly relates to a method of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators show a lack of concern for family, future regrets, or reasons to live, suggesting hopelessness or detachment.
   - There is a specific mention of a method (using a gun) and a targeted area (brain stem), indicating intent and planning.
   - No references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly stated with words like ""suicide"" or ""killing myself,"" but the context of asking about gun positioning for the brain stem strongly implies a desire to die.
   - There is an indirect but clear expression of wanting to end one's life through the method discussed. Since it’s not entirely explicit with the word ""suicide,"" I lean toward caution, but the intent is unmistakable.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: using a gun and targeting the brain stem.
   - While there are no explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun or writing a note), the detailed question about positioning suggests active consideration of how to execute the act.
   - Given the specificity of the method, this leans toward planning rather than vague ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post does not refer to past events or attempts; it appears to focus on current or future intentions based on the question about gun positioning.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - This post goes beyond general distress or vague thoughts of dying (Indicator) due to the implied intent to die.
   - It also goes beyond mere thoughts of not wanting to live (Ideation) because it includes a specific method (gun to the brain stem), which aligns with planning.
   - The mention of a specific method and targeted area fits the definition of Behavior, as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (implied) and a plan/method.
   - Since there’s no mention of past actions, Attempt does not apply.
   - Given the rule to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' if unsure about explicit planning, I note the method is very specific, so Behavior seems appropriate. However, since suicide is not explicitly worded, I double-check the caution to lean toward lower categories if uncertain. Still, the context and specificity strongly suggest Behavior.

My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide are present: ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to attempt again,"" and ""a mind that wants to die.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, loneliness, and giving up: ""I hate every little thing about myself,"" ""I am not fighting anymore,"" ""I give up.""
   - Specific plans or methods are not clearly detailed for the upcoming attempt (""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again""), though past methods are mentioned (overdose).
   - References to past attempts are explicit: ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out,"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I'm going to attempt again"" and ""I want to die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, clearly stated as ""I want to die"" and ""a mind that wants to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not for the current/future attempt; the post only says ""attempt again"" without specifying how. Past attempts mention overdose as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No concrete signs of preparation for the current attempt (e.g., no mention of acquiring means, writing notes, or choosing locations).
   - Since there is no explicit planning for the current intention, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' for current thoughts, but past attempts need consideration.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. Past attempts are described (""tried to overdose three times,"" ""first attempt at the beginning of this year""), and current/future intent is mentioned (""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, overdose is mentioned as the method for past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - For current thoughts, there is no specific plan or method mentioned for the upcoming attempt (""attempt again"" is vague), which leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - However, the post also describes past attempts with a specific method (overdose) and mentions current intent to attempt again. Per the definition of 'attempt,' if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Given the explicit reference to past concrete actions (overdose attempts) and the rule to classify as 'attempt' when past attempts and current plans are both present, 'attempt' is the most appropriate category.

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post clearly expresses a desire to die with statements like ""Gonna be gone after this weekend.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging is mentioned as painless, and there is a reference to buying ""the right stuff.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, plans to buy items, say goodbyes, and a timeline of ""after this weekend"" indicate preparation.
   - The explicit mention of a method and preparation leans toward 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both are present—past attempts are mentioned (""I tried. But it didn’t work""), and current/future intentions are clear with plans for ""after this weekend.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, though not in detail, the post confirms a past attempt that failed.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, fitting 'ideation.'
   - It also includes specific plans, methods (hanging), and preparations (buying stuff, saying goodbyes, timeline), which aligns with 'behavior.'
   - Additionally, past attempts are mentioned, which fits 'attempt.'
   - Per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt.' Given the presence of both past attempts and current detailed plans, 'attempt' takes precedence as per the guideline.

But if i still feel the same or worse by the time im around that age. Adios i can't. It's not worth it. I'm sorry to the people i know in advance. I don't know what's wrong with me. But I'm really grateful to be able to meet you all, if by any chance there is another life, i wish we could hang out again. But this life for me isn't it. Ill update back on this post innnn 8 yrs or so. Maybe? Who knows. No promises &gt;:) anyway, I hope you all have a great day and thank you for reading to whatever this is",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of planning to kill oneself at a specific age (25 or 30), expressions of hopelessness (""this life for me isn't it""), and emotional distress (""I don't know what's wrong with me"").
   - There is a direct mention of suicide through the phrase ""killing myself.""
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned for carrying out the act.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""killing myself"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""this life for me isn't it"" and planning to end life at a specific age).
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned for carrying out the act.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident in the post.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method described, it leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to future intentions (planning to kill oneself at age 25 or 30), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'ideation.'
   - Although there is a mention of a timeline (age 25 or 30), this does not constitute a specific plan or method as defined by the 'behavior' category (e.g., no mention of how or where it would happen).
   - Since no past attempts are mentioned, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of suicide but lack of specific planning, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category over 'indicator' or 'behavior.'

329,"Been teetering on the edge lately. Because as a queer person I'm perceived as male and a threat. Now I know why the suicide rate for men is four times as high as for women, and I have so much respect for cismen who have to deal with being eyed with suspicion.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include feeling on the edge, societal perception as a threat due to being queer and perceived as male, and a reference to the high suicide rate among men.
   - There are no direct mentions of personal intent to die, self-harm, or suicide. The mention of suicide is in a general, statistical context about men, not a personal expression.
   - Emotional indicators include distress or frustration about societal perception, but no explicit hopelessness or despair related to personal suicidal thoughts.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts by the poster.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in a general context about suicide rates among men, not as a personal intent or desire.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post does not express a personal desire to die or end their life.
   - Since the mention of suicide is not personal or explicit regarding the poster’s intent, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no hint of planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings (""lately"") but does not indicate past events or future intentions related to suicide.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains a general reference to suicide rates but lacks any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or intent to die.
   - There is no mention of a plan or past attempt.
   - Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' as it reflects distress and a vague reference to suicide in a societal context, without personal intent or explicit mention of wanting to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a direct mention of suicide in the context of a conversation with the user's mom.
   - Emotional indicators include a sense of finality and sadness (e.g., ""Peace out all,"" sad emoticon "":("", and wishing others well).
   - There is a specific timeframe mentioned: ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours,"" which suggests intent or a plan regarding timing.
   - No specific methods, tools, or locations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No reference to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is directly referenced in the context of a discussion with the user's mom.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" strongly implies a desire or intent to not be alive, even if not explicitly stating ""I want to die.""
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned and there is an implication of intent, this leans away from 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to commit suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no mentions of notes, acquiring means, or other concrete preparations. The timeframe (""within 24 hours"") suggests intent but lacks specificity about how it would be carried out.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method described, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a current or future intention (""within 24 hours""), not a past event.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.
   - The focus is on a potential future action, not a historical one.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and implies a desire to not be alive with the statement ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours."" This rules out 'indicator' as the mention of suicide and intent is clear.
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, only a timeframe, which is not enough to classify as 'behavior.' As per the rule, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit mention of suicide and implied intent without a specific plan.

The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>

   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.

   - It lacks specific plans or methods, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and suicide: The user explicitly states ""I want to die"" and describes taking a large quantity of muscle relaxers and pain killers with the hope of not waking up.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, feelings of failure in multiple aspects of life, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user describes taking ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" yesterday, indicating a specific method and action taken with intent to end their life.
   - References to past attempts: The user mentions failing ""twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" which suggests previous attempts, including the detailed incident from yesterday.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""I want to die"" and describes actions taken with the intent to not wake up.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, very clear with ""I want to die"" and the description of hoping not to wake up after taking pills.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user mentions taking a large quantity of muscle relaxers and pain killers as a method to end their life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of taking the pills indicates preparation and execution of a plan.
   - Since there is explicit mention of a method and action taken, this leans toward 'behavior' or 'attempt' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past events (attempts in the last 4 days, including a specific incident yesterday) and current feelings (""I want to die""), but does not mention future plans explicitly beyond the general desire to die.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user describes taking pills yesterday with the intent to not wake up, and mentions failing twice in the last 4 days.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to die""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond 'ideation' because there is a specific method and action described (taking a large quantity of pills).
   - It could fit 'behavior' due to the mention of a specific method and action taken, but the focus on past actions (attempts in the last 4 days, including yesterday) suggests 'attempt' as the primary category.
   - According to the definition, 'attempt' focuses on historic actions, and the rule states that if a post refers to past attempts and current plans, it should still be labeled as 'attempt'. While current plans are not explicit beyond a desire to die, the detailed past attempt (yesterday) is the dominant feature.
   - Therefore, 'attempt' is the most fitting category as it describes concrete past actions taken to end their life.

   - Mentions of death and suicide are present: explicit references to ""end it,"" ""suicide ideation,"" wanting to ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink,"" and struggling to ""stay on the tracks.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feeling like a ""coward,"" accumulated trauma, pain from loss of a relationship, and a belief that ""nobody would care"" about their death.
   - Specific plans or methods are mentioned: jumping in front of a train (Amtrak or Metrolink), knowledge of the train schedule, and proximity to the tracks.
   - References to past attempts are present: ""the times I have tried,"" ""the first time I actually attempted,"" and a friend calling 911 during a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly mentions ""suicide ideation"" and expresses a desire to end their life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user talks about wanting to ""end it"" and not wanting to live due to pain and trauma.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user explicitly mentions jumping in front of a train (Amtrak or Metrolink) as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user knows the train schedule and lives close to the tracks, indicating some level of planning or familiarity with the means.
   - Since there is explicit planning mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to both past attempts (""the times I have tried,"" ""the first time I actually attempted"") and current intentions (""I know the way I will end it,"" wanting to jump in front of a train, asking for help to ""stay on the tracks"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, there is a mention of a past attempt where a friend called 911, indicating a concrete past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, fitting at least 'ideation.'
   - It also includes a specific plan (jumping in front of a train) and signs of preparation (knowing the schedule, living near tracks), which aligns with 'behavior.'
   - Additionally, there are clear references to past attempts, which fits the 'attempt' category.
   - Per the rules, if a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, despite the strong elements of 'behavior' due to current planning, the presence of past attempts combined with current plans directs the classification to 'attempt.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of being a burden and implied hopelessness or despair (e.g., not leaving the house since 14, lying in bed all day).
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
   - Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or desire to die, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods mentioned (tools, locations, substances).
   - No signs of preparation (notes, acquiring means).
   - Since there is no planning or behavior indicated, 'ideation' is not applicable, and 'behavior' is ruled out.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current circumstances (living at home, not leaving the house).
   - No mention of past attempts or current/future intentions regarding suicide.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or desire to die. There are no plans, methods, or past attempts described. Per the definitions and rules, even significant dissatisfaction with life falls under 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, this fits the 'indicator' category.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (graduation night).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'

   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit mention of a method and timing, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification over 'ideation.'

It is far beyond 'indicator' or 'ideation' due to the explicit planning.

The lockdown and cold winter put everything that much more true. I've never felt as alone as I did there. I was very depressed, bored and lots of anxiety. Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write. Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much. For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions thoughts of ""what if I wasn't in this world"" and questioning if they would ""gain peace,"" which suggests thoughts about death or not being alive.
   - Emotional indicators include feeling alone, depressed, bored, anxious, and unable to sleep, indicating significant distress.

   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned with the phrase ""on the verge of becoming suicidal,"" but there is no direct expression of a current desire to die or end their life.
   - The thought of not being in this world is mentioned, but it is framed as something that scared them and not something they intended to act on.
   - Since the expression is not a clear, direct desire to die and leans more toward reflection, I will consider this closer to 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline to err on the side of 'indicator' when unclear.

   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events during lockdown, not current or future intentions.
   - No past attempts are described, only thoughts that occurred in the past.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains a vague reference to not being in this world and mentions being on the verge of becoming suicidal, but lacks a direct, explicit expression of wanting to die or end their life currently. The guideline states to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit mention of suicide. The emotional distress is significant, but without a clear statement of suicidal intent or desire, it aligns with 'indicator'. There is no plan or past attempt mentioned, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' do not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to ""end myself"" and ""end it tonight,"" indicating suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators are present, such as being ""really depressed and sad"" and ""crying all night and morning,"" reflecting despair and hopelessness.
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""trying to overdose,"" which suggests a plan.
   - There is a reference to past attempts with the word ""again,"" implying this is not the first time the person has considered or tried this.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned with phrases like ""end myself"" and ""end it tonight."" (Yes)
   - There are direct expressions of wanting to die. (Yes)
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""trying to overdose."" (Yes)
   - No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring pills) are detailed, but the mention of a method leans toward planning.
   - Given the specific method, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current/future intentions with ""tonight.""
   - The word ""again"" suggests past attempts or thoughts, but the focus is on a current plan.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of wanting to end life, combined with a specific method (""overdose""), fits the definition of 'behavior' as it includes a plan.
   - Although there is a reference to past attempts with ""again,"" the primary focus is on the current plan for tonight, and the past attempt is not described in detail. However, per the rule, if past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Re-evaluating the rule: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt.'"" Since ""again"" implies a past attempt and there is a current plan, 'attempt' is the correct classification.

For anyone who has read this, thank you. Even if just one person reads this, it means a lot to me that you did. Some people just aren't meant for this world, and that's okay. My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and dying are present (""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""my death will release my pain"").
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair (""I can't fight anymore,"" ""I can't try anymore,"" ""so tired,"" ""tortured soul"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are included.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned; the post talks about death and the end of life but does not directly state ""suicide"" or ""killing myself.""
   - There are direct expressions of not wanting to continue living (""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""some people just aren't meant for this world,"" ""my death will release my pain"").
   - Since the mention of suicide is not very explicit (the word ""suicide"" or direct intent to kill oneself is absent), I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to future intentions (""in the next month or two,"" ""my death will release my pain"").
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses a sense of impending death and a desire to no longer live, with strong emotional distress and hopelessness. However, suicide is not explicitly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" or a clear statement of intent to kill oneself is absent). As per the guideline, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned, I must choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.' There is no specific plan or mention of past attempts, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' do not apply. Therefore, the best fit is 'indicator.'

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain .

I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and dying: The user talks about their mother dying from cancer and expresses fear of ""joining her"" after her passing, which implies thoughts of their own death.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of self-hatred, regret, fear, and hopelessness (""I hate myself so much,"" ""I dont see any future ahead for me,"" ""I am so scared"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The reference to ""joining"" their mother is vague and lacks detail on how this might happen.
   - References to past attempts: The user mentions having struggled with suicide before and being hospitalized for it, indicating a history of suicidal behavior or thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly mentions having struggled with suicide in the past and expresses a fear of ""joining"" their mother, which implies suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user states, ""I dont see any future ahead for me"" and fears ""joining"" their mother after her death, which suggests a desire or contemplation of not being alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to end their life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of actions like writing notes or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post mentions past struggles with suicide and hospitalization, as well as current emotional distress and future fear of death after their mother passes.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The user mentions being hospitalized for suicide-related issues in the past, but no specific details of an attempt (e.g., method or action like overdose) are provided. As per the definition, merely thinking of an attempt or struggling does not qualify as 'attempt' unless a concrete action is described. However, the guideline states that if a post refers to past attempts and current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt'. Here, while past struggles are mentioned, current plans are not explicit (no specific method or preparation), so I will consider this further in category reasoning.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - Indicator: This does not fit because there are explicit mentions of suicide and thoughts of not wanting to be alive (""joining"" their mother, past struggles).
   - Ideation: This seems to fit because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I dont see any future ahead for me,"" fear of joining their mother), but no specific plan or method is mentioned.
   - Behavior: This does not fit because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - Attempt: While the user mentions past struggles with suicide and hospitalization, there is no concrete description of a past attempt (e.g., a specific action like overdose). The definition of 'attempt' requires a concrete past action, and merely struggling or being hospitalized may not suffice without further detail. Additionally, while the guideline mentions labeling as 'attempt' if past attempts and current plans are mentioned, the current thoughts lack a specific plan, leaning more toward ideation. Given the ambiguity, I will prioritize the current expression of suicidal thoughts without a plan, which aligns with 'ideation'. If there were clearer evidence of a past concrete attempt, 'attempt' might apply, but based on the information, 'ideation' seems more appropriate.
   - Final reasoning: The explicit mention of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan points to 'ideation'. The past mention of hospitalization is noted but does not override the current focus on thoughts without action or detailed past attempt description.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, mental exhaustion, and being ""tired of living.""
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for suicide or self-harm.
   - There are no references to past attempts at suicide.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although the phrase ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" could be interpreted as vague references to not wanting to continue, they are not explicit statements of wanting to die or commit suicide.
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'ideation' would be considered over 'behavior,' but given the lack of explicit suicidal intent, 'indicator' is more appropriate.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current struggles and emotional pain, with vague references to needing to ""stop it"" in the future.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to die. The vague phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""stop it"" do not meet the threshold for explicit suicidal ideation as defined in the guidelines. There are no specific plans or past attempts mentioned. Therefore, following the rule to lean toward 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, this post best fits the 'indicator' category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and thoughts, not past events or future intentions regarding a specific act.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The explicit mention of contemplating suicide and the desire to not be here at all fits the definition of 'ideation,' as there are clear suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or preparation. It does not fit 'indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, nor 'behavior' due to the lack of a plan, nor 'attempt' as there is no reference to past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire for ""release,"" which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it includes suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.
   - It does not fit 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - It does not fit 'behavior' because there is no mention of a plan or method.
   - It does not fit 'attempt' because there is no reference to past actions.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions wanting to ""go sleep forever,"" which implies a desire to not be alive. There is a clear expression of distress and frustration with life (""can't take this shit no more,"" ""sick and tired of my shitty life""). 
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident in the tone and language used.
   - Specific plans or methods: The post lists specific medications and quantities (""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg""), which could imply a means to carry out a plan, possibly an overdose.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""go sleep forever"" strongly implies a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""go sleep forever"" and ""can't take this shit no more"" suggest a desire to end life.
   - Since it is not explicitly ""suicide"" but heavily implied, I lean toward a higher category than 'indicator' due to the strong implication.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user lists specific medications and quantities, which could be interpreted as a means for self-harm or suicide (e.g., overdose).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly (e.g., no mention of taking the pills or writing a note), but listing the medications suggests potential access to means.
   - Since there is mention of specific means but not explicit preparation or action, I lean toward 'behavior' but will confirm with other factors.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I wanna go sleep forever"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an implied desire to die (""go sleep forever"") and lists specific medications and quantities, which suggests a possible method or means. While suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the intent is clear. The mention of specific drugs and amounts pushes this beyond vague ideation into a potential plan, fitting the 'behavior' category. If I were uncertain, I would lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but the specificity of the medications listed supports 'behavior.' There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.

   - There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not directly mentioned by term, but there are explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"") and not wanting to be alive (""I'm tired of being alive""). (Yes to direct expressions of wanting to die.)
   - Since there is a clear desire to not be alive, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.

I want this to end but I am scared.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Yes, the post explicitly talks about past attempts and a current desire to end their life (""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end"").
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of self-hatred (""I hate myself so much""), despair, and fear (""I am scared"").
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: Mentions past use of a knife, current possession of a rope, and consideration of a building as a location, though with hesitation about traumatizing others.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, explicitly states having tried multiple times with a knife and bailing out.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I have to do it"" and past attempts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I want this to end"" and ""I should've done it a long time ago.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a knife (past), a rope (current possession), and a building (potential location).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Partially, as they mention having a rope and considering a building, though they haven't ""checked out the place"" and express hesitation.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': While there is mention of means and a location, the planning seems incomplete or undecided. However, the explicit mention of tools (rope) and a location (building) leans toward some form of plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. It describes past attempts with a knife and current thoughts/intentions with a rope and building.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, with the mention of trying with a knife.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions past attempts (""tried with a knife""), which aligns with the 'attempt' category.
   - It also includes current suicidal thoughts and mentions of a rope and a building, which could suggest 'behavior' due to the presence of a potential plan.
   - However, per the definition, if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, despite the current planning elements, the presence of a described past attempt takes precedence as per the rule.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned; the phrase ""end it"" is vague and could refer to ending pain or life.
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to ""end it,"" which leans toward a desire to not be alive, though it is not explicitly about dying or suicide.
   - Since it is unclear, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness with a vague desire to ""end it,"" but lacks explicit mention of suicide or dying.
   - As per the guidelines, since suicide is not very explicitly mentioned, and there is doubt, I must choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow,"" which suggests a desire not to be alive.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and loneliness (""Tired of being alone"") and anticipated depression (""Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed"").
   - References a future potential attempt (""depressed enough to attempt properly again""), implying a past attempt or consideration.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned; however, there is a direct expression of not wanting to wake up, which implies a desire not to be alive (Yes to direct expression of wanting to die).
   - Since it’s a clear expression of not wanting to live, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, it leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"") and future potential depression leading to an attempt (""depressed enough to attempt properly again"").
   - The phrase ""attempt properly again"" suggests a past attempt or consideration, but it is not described in detail (no concrete past action mentioned like an overdose or specific event).
   - Focus remains on current/future thoughts rather than a detailed historic action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow""), which rules out 'indicator.'
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method for suicide, so 'behavior' is not applicable.
   - While there is a vague reference to a past attempt (""attempt properly again""), it lacks detail of a concrete past action, and the primary focus is on current feelings and future potential, so 'attempt' may not be the best fit.
   - The strongest fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit desire not to be alive without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a direct request for someone to kill the person and hide their body, with specific mention of not wanting to be found and being okay with being ""chopped up.""
   - Emotional indicators suggest a desire to die and a lack of concern for their own life.
   - There is a specific plan implied in terms of wanting someone to kill them and hide the body, though the method of killing is not explicitly detailed by the person themselves.
   - No references to past attempts are mentioned.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned as the person is asking someone to kill them, which indicates a clear desire to die.
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A plan is mentioned in terms of asking someone to kill them and hide their body, with additional detail about not being found and being ""chopped up."" While the exact method of killing is not specified by the person (e.g., no mention of a weapon or specific means), the intent and request for assistance in dying along with body disposal suggest a form of planning.
   - There are no explicit signs of personal preparation (e.g., acquiring means themselves), but the request for someone else to act implies a structured intent.
   - Given the uncertainty about whether this constitutes a fully explicit personal plan, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as the person is not detailing their own method or means.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current or future intentions (looking for someone to kill them), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die and includes a form of planning (asking for someone to kill them and hide the body). However, since the specific method or means of death is not detailed by the person themselves and there is no indication of personal preparation, it does not fully meet the threshold for 'behavior' as defined. The rules suggest leaning toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' when unsure about explicit planning. Therefore, 'ideation' seems the most appropriate category.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned as ""suicidal thoughts"" (Yes).
   - There is a direct expression of fantasizing about death, but the user states, ""I have no desire to die."" However, they also mention considering it due to exhaustion from fighting these thoughts. Given the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, this leans toward an indicator of suicidal ideation despite the mixed message.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" which aligns with the definition of 'ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.
   - Despite the statement ""I have no desire to die,"" the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and considering it due to exhaustion suggests ideation rather than just a vague indicator.
   - There is no mention of a plan or method, so 'behavior' is not applicable.
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

   - There are emotional indicators of despair and feeling overwhelmed.
   - There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide.
   - There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (no direct reference to ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"").
   - There is a direct expression of not wanting to live (""I don't want to live this again""), which aligns with suicidal thoughts.
   - Since the mention of not wanting to live is explicit but suicide itself is not directly stated, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this does not qualify for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains a direct expression of not wanting to live, which suggests suicidal thoughts. However, the guidelines emphasize that the mention of suicide must be very explicit to move beyond 'indicator.' Since ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself"" is not directly stated, and the instruction is to lean toward 'indicator' when in doubt, this post fits best in the 'indicator' category despite the strong emotional distress and statement of not wanting to live.
   - It does not meet the criteria for 'ideation' due to the lack of explicit suicide mention, nor 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, nor 'attempt' as there is no reference to past actions.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and intentions about wanting to die.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past attempts are described, only a long-standing thought of wanting to die.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is a vague reference to a method (""kill myself without leaving a body""), but it lacks specificity or evidence of concrete planning or preparation. Per the guideline to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain about explicit planning, this fits 'ideation'.
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'ideation' due to the explicit suicidal thoughts without a clear, specific plan.

370,"No point in it all. I hate being trapped in limbo. I need something to really push me over the edge. I won't get anywhere in life and people are starting to lose hope in me (as they should). A lot of times I feel like I wasn't meant for this world. I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is. Everything here is lame and it just makes me sick and I don't really see a future for myself. In the end, I'm just going to keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me. One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of feeling trapped, no point in life, questioning the point of moving on, and a dim view of the world indicate deep hopelessness and despair.
   - Phrases like ""push me over the edge,"" ""wasn't meant for this world,"" ""one last push and I'll be free,"" and ""eternal void"" suggest thoughts of death or dying.
   - No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm, no specific methods, plans, or preparations for ending life are described.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not directly mention ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""one last push and I'll be free"" and ""eternal void"" imply a desire to escape life, potentially through death, though it remains vague and not explicitly tied to suicide.
   - Since it's unclear and not explicitly about suicide, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any concrete means to end life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable, and I would lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if considering suicidal thoughts, but the lack of explicit suicide mention keeps it at 'indicator.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post reflects current feelings and a potential future desire to be ""free,"" but it is not tied to a specific time or event.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and vague references to death or being free from life (""push over the edge,"" ""eternal void""), but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die by suicide.
   - As per the guidelines, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, even with strong dissatisfaction or hopelessness, it should be classified as 'indicator.' The lack of a specific plan or past attempt further rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt.'
   - Although there are hints of wanting to escape life, the absence of direct language about suicide or dying pushes this toward 'indicator' rather than 'ideation.'

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - The post mentions suicide explicitly in the context of discussing people who commit suicide.

373,"Goddamn I am so tired of having to live. 23, never had a job in my life, and I'm about to fail college yet again. I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances. Life isn't about making something happen, it's about taking opportunities that come to you, and I feel like none have come to me except one.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of death with the statement ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" This indicates a thought or feeling related to death.
   - Emotional indicators are strongly present, including hopelessness, despair, frustration, anxiety, and depression. The user describes a constant state of anxiety and depression, inability to function, lack of motivation, and feelings of disconnection from family and friends.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide or self-harm mentioned in the post.
   - There are no references to past attempts at suicide or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. The user does not directly state a desire to commit suicide or use terms like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life.""
   - There is a vague expression of wanting to be dead with the statement ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" However, this is not a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive right now. As per the guidelines, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - There are no signs of preparation such as writing notes or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this leans away from 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The mention of being ""dead"" in five years refers to a future state but is not tied to a specific intention or plan.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts or events related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains significant expressions of distress, hopelessness, and depression, but lacks explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire to die. The reference to being ""dead"" in five years is vague and not a clear expression of suicidal intent. As per the rules, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned, the classification should lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.' There are no mentions of plans or past attempts, ruling out 'behavior' and 'attempt.' Therefore, the best fit is 'indicator.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of ""kill their self,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include a reference to ending pain, suggesting distress or hopelessness.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for committing suicide.
   - There are no references to past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""kill their self"" is a clear reference to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly for the person writing the post; the question is framed as a general inquiry (""if someone wants to kill their self"") rather than a personal desire. However, the note ""asking for a personal reason"" suggests it may relate to the writer's own feelings, though it remains ambiguous.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.' Given the explicit mention of suicide but lack of personal intent, this is a borderline case, but the explicit mention pushes toward at least 'ideation.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no tools, locations, or substances mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.' Since no plan is mentioned, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post is a general question, not specific to past, current, or future actions of the writer.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide with the phrase ""kill their self,"" which disqualifies it from being 'indicator' since 'indicator' requires no explicit mention of suicide.
   - It does not express a clear personal desire to die (framed as a general question), but the explicit mention of suicide and the context of ""asking for a personal reason"" suggests it aligns more with 'ideation' than 'indicator.'
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so it does not qualify as 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to the explicit mention of suicide without a plan or past attempt.

So remember when I was 10 or 11 I came home from school just to find out that my teacher called my mom because I failed the spelling bee test, so while I was in my backyard with my narcissistic mom scolded I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning since it was pretty deep and I didn't know how to swim. So some how she convince me not to. Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts since childhood (""I been suicidal since I was about 10 or 11""), a past incident of considering drowning in a lake, and current thoughts of suicide by train on their 18th birthday.
   - Emotional indicators include depression, faking daily life, and ongoing suicidal ideation (""every hour... suicide by a train is on my mind"").
   - Specific plans and methods are mentioned: suicide by train, specifically placing their neck on the tracks, and a timeline (18th birthday).
   - References to a past near-attempt (thinking of drowning in the lake at 10 or 11) are present, though it did not result in an actual attempt as they were convinced not to act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""I been suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned: suicide by train, with details about placing their neck on the tracks and questioning if it will instantly kill them.
   - Yes, there are signs of planning: a specific timeline (18th birthday) and a chosen method (train tracks).
   - The planning is explicit and detailed, not vague.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to both past events (considering drowning at 10 or 11) and current/future intentions (suicide by train at 18).
   - The past event is described but does not constitute an actual attempt since no action was taken (they were convinced not to jump in the lake).
   - The current/future plan is the dominant focus with specific details.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation due to the specific plan (train tracks, neck placement, birthday timeline), which aligns with 'behavior'.
   - While there is a past near-attempt mentioned, it does not meet the criteria for 'attempt' since no concrete action occurred (they did not jump in the lake). However, the rule states that if a post refers to past attempts and current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt'. Since the past event is not a concrete attempt, I lean toward 'behavior' based on the current explicit plan.
   - Given the explicit planning and current focus, 'behavior' fits best. However, I must adhere to the rule: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Since the past event is borderline (thought of drowning but no action), I reconsider. Still, the primary focus is the current plan, but the rule pushes toward 'attempt' due to past reference combined with current plans.
   - Final check: The past event is not a clear attempt (no action taken), so 'behavior' may still apply, but strict adherence to the rule suggests 'attempt' due to the combination of past reference and current plan.
   - Upon re-evaluation, I note the rule's intent to prioritize 'attempt' in such mixed contexts. Thus, I will classify it as 'attempt'.

I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicidal thoughts: The user explicitly states they’ve had suicidal thoughts throughout their life.
   - Emotional indicators: There’s a sense of distress and confusion about why they feel this way, especially triggered by someone else’s attempt. They express a desire not to think like this anymore.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - References to past thoughts: The user mentions past suicidal thoughts but clarifies most are behind them. No past attempts are described.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user mentions having had suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not currently. The user talks about past thoughts and a recent trigger making suicide seem more “real” or “attainable,” but there’s no current explicit desire to die or end their life.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While suicide is explicitly mentioned, the current context seems more reflective than an active desire. However, since suicidal thoughts are acknowledged, it leans toward ideation.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any specific means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There’s no planning or behavior mentioned, so this doesn’t apply.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past suicidal thoughts (mostly behind them) and a current trigger making suicide seem more “real,” but no clear current intention to act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only thoughts are mentioned, not actions or attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - Indicator: This category applies to posts with no explicit mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts. Since the user explicitly mentions past suicidal thoughts and a current trigger, this doesn’t fully fit.
   - Ideation: This category fits explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. The user acknowledges past suicidal thoughts and a current shift in perception (suicide feeling more “real” or “attainable” after someone else’s attempt), but no active desire or plan is expressed. This seems the best fit.
   - Behavior: There’s no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so this category doesn’t apply.
   - Attempt: There’s no description of a past attempt by the user, only thoughts, so this category doesn’t apply.
   - Conclusion: The post fits 'ideation' due to explicit mention of suicidal thoughts (past and triggered reflection) without a current plan or past attempt.

   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"" is not used).
   - However, there is a direct expression of wanting life to end, which indicates a desire to not be alive.
   - Since the mention is not vague and expresses a clear desire, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator,' despite the lack of the explicit term ""suicide.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation are evident.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and thoughts, not past events or future intentions beyond the general desire for life to end.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting life to end, which aligns with suicidal thoughts under the 'ideation' category.
   - It does not fall under 'indicator' because the desire to not be alive is clear, even if the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - It does not qualify as 'behavior' due to the absence of any specific plan or preparation.
   - It does not qualify as 'attempt' since there is no mention of past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or dying: Yes, there are references to stepping off a building or over a bridge.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of disconnection, dissociation, hopelessness, and lack of control over emotions or life. Mentions of not feeling anything even during serious events like a pet's death or nearly killing oneself.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions stepping off a building or over a bridge as potential actions, though not detailed in terms of preparation or immediacy.
   - References to past attempts: There is a vague mention of ""nearly killing myself one night,"" but it is not clear if this was an actual attempt or just a thought.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, indirectly through phrases like ""step off a building or over a bridge.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post implies a desire to end life as a way to feel in control (""maybe then I could finally feel like I'm in control of myself"").
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear; there are explicit mentions of dying, so it moves beyond 'indicator.'

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no mentions of specific preparations like acquiring means, writing notes, or setting a specific time/location.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': While methods are mentioned, there is no clear evidence of preparation or immediate intent, so I lean toward 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The mention of ""nearly killing myself one night"" refers to a past event, but it is vague and not confirmed as an actual attempt. The primary focus is on current feelings and future possibilities (""it'll only take one day where I step off a building"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the past event is not described in detail; it remains unclear if it was an actual attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, moving it beyond 'indicator.'
   - Specific methods (building, bridge) are mentioned, but there is no evidence of a concrete plan or preparation, so it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - The mention of a past event (""nearly killing myself"") is too vague to classify as a confirmed past attempt, so it does not fit 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation,' as it reflects explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or confirmed past attempt.

   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method, only a general desire to end life and a fear of pain, which rules out 'behavior.'
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation,' as it reflects explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

I work 8 hours on the weekends and I like to sleep afterwords, just a nap right? Who doesn't like an after work nap? Well, apparently my family because as of today I am the most useless person alive. My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way.

   - Given the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and a specific plan with preparation, this fits the 'behavior' category. It is not just ideation because a method and preparation are detailed, and it is not an attempt since there is no reference to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The post focuses on questioning the purpose of living and the length of life.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide are present, specifically ""passive suicidal,"" ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal,"" and ""suicide by cop.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death or suicide: The post explicitly talks about choosing a way to ""go"" using insulin pens or a pump, implying a method to end their life.
   - Emotional indicators: The user mentions being depressed for most of their life and hating being a burden, indicating hopelessness and distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user describes a potential method involving insulin pens or a pump, with access to ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button,"" and considers it the ""easiest and most accessible"" way. They also mention having ""a couple ideas"" for how to do it.
   - References to past attempts: There is no mention of past suicide attempts, only thoughts about doing it but not following through due to hassle.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user talks about choosing a way to ""go,"" which in context clearly implies ending their life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the intent to die is implied through the discussion of methods and choosing how to ""go.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user mentions using insulin pens or a pump with access to large amounts of insulin as a potential method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are no concrete signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means beyond what is medically provided or writing a note), but the user has thought about how to use the insulin pump if obtained.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': While the method is specific (insulin pump), the user does not currently have the pump and mentions it as a future possibility (""if my condition goes south quick""). However, the specificity of the method and intent leans toward planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current thoughts and future intentions (getting a pump if condition worsens).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only thoughts about doing it in the past but not acting on them due to hassle.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts with a specific method (insulin pump) mentioned as a potential way to end their life. The user has access to insulin pens currently and contemplates a future scenario with a pump as the ""easiest"" method. While there is no immediate preparation (e.g., the pump is not yet acquired), the mention of a specific method and intent to use it if obtained aligns with the definition of 'behavior' as it includes explicit planning. There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply. The explicit mention of a method rules out 'indicator' and 'ideation.'

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life.

Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions attempting to end their life, cutting wrists and thighs (self-harm), and being ready to die.
   - Emotional indicators: Intense distress, despair, frustration, and self-loathing (""too much of a pussy,"" ""living life as a shell is bullshit"").
   - Specific plans or methods: Mentions a knife as a tool used for self-harm, and describes being on the verge of taking further action.
   - References to past attempts: The user states, ""I just attempted to end my life,"" indicating a recent or immediate past action of trying to commit suicide.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states they ""attempted to end my life"" and were ""ready to leave everything.""
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the user expresses a clear intent to die and frustration at not being able to follow through.

   - Past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user describes a specific recent attempt involving a knife and self-harm.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes a recent suicide attempt with a specific method (knife) and self-harm actions (cutting wrists and thighs). The focus is on a past action that was attempted, fitting the definition of 'attempt' as it describes a concrete action taken in the past. Although there is ongoing distress, the primary context is the historic attempt rather than a current plan. Per the rules, even if current thoughts are present, a past attempt described in detail classifies as 'attempt'.

I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

My fat ass of a guidance councillor was too busy eating chips to check her email and pull me out of the college level class early on. What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail? I got a fifty last term and the only way to pass is to get a 80 this term. That's impossible. Plus I only have a week left.

Kinda sad I never got to do anything. Not that I could've anyways.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicit references to ""ending my life tonight"" and ""killing myself is the only escape.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair evident in statements like ""what's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail?"" and feeling trapped with ""pure evil"" parents.
   - Specific plans/methods: Mentions a specific method (""slit my wrists with some scissors"") and timing (""when everyone is going to bed""). Also mentions a suicide note already written on the notes app.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts, only current intentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with clear statements like ""ending my life tonight"" and ""killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, multiple direct statements of intent to die.
   - No ambiguity here; explicit mentions are present, so it cannot be 'indicator.'

   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slit my wrists with some scissors"" is a specific method, and timing is mentioned (""when everyone is going to bed"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the person has written a suicide note on their notes app.
   - No uncertainty; explicit planning and preparation are evident, pointing toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current/future intentions (""tonight"" and ""when everyone is going to bed"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.
   - Focus is on current plans, not historic actions, so 'attempt' is not applicable unless current plans are overridden by past actions (which they are not).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - Not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned with clear intent to die.
   - Not just 'ideation' because there is a specific plan (method: slit wrists with scissors, timing: when everyone is asleep) and preparation (suicide note written).
   - Fits 'behavior' due to explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a specific plan and preparation.
   - Not 'attempt' because there is no mention of past actions or attempts, only current intentions.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'behavior' as it meets the criteria of explicit suicidal thoughts with a plan and preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a direct mention of killing oneself (""im gonna kill myself"") and a specific timeframe (""3 weeks from now""). 
   - Emotional indicators include possible despair or resignation implied by minimal interaction with others and concern for the safety of their child (""I hope my baby ends up safe"").
   - There is a specific plan in terms of timing (3 weeks), but no mention of a method, location, or tools for suicide.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""im gonna kill myself"").
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die: Yes (""im gonna kill myself"").
   - Since it is explicit, this goes beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - There are no signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) beyond stating a timeframe of 3 weeks.
   - Since there is no explicit method or preparation mentioned, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline (""If unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"").

   - The post refers to future intentions (""3 weeks from now""), not past events.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a question about whether a combination of substances (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, and alcohol) would ""kill me.""
   - There is an implied focus on death or dying through the phrasing ""would this kill me.""
   - Emotional indicators are not explicitly present (no direct mention of hopelessness or despair), but the context suggests distress or curiosity about lethal outcomes.
   - Specific substances and quantities are mentioned (Midol 3 bottles, Prozac 30 20mg pills, Tylenol bottle, alcohol), which could indicate a method or plan.
   - No reference to past attempts is made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is absent).
   - There is a direct question about whether the combination would ""kill me,"" which implies a thought or curiosity about dying but does not explicitly state a desire to die or commit suicide.
   - Since it is unclear if this is a direct expression of wanting to die, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are mentioned (multiple bottles of medication and alcohol with quantities listed), which could suggest a potential plan or at least a concrete idea of means.
   - There are no explicit signs of preparation (e.g., no mention of acquiring these items specifically for this purpose, writing a note, or taking steps to use them).
   - Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning or intent to act, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post does not refer to past events or attempts; it appears to be a current or hypothetical question (""would this kill me"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or a clear desire to die, which leans toward 'indicator' based on the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit mentions.
   - However, the mention of specific substances and quantities suggests a level of detail that could align with 'ideation' or even 'behavior.'
   - Since there is no clear expression of intent to act or preparation (just a question about lethality), and the guideline prioritizes caution in escalating categories, 'ideation' seems more appropriate than 'behavior.'
   - Given the rule to err on the side of 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I reconsider if the phrasing ""would this kill me"" is explicit enough. It implies a focus on death but lacks a direct statement of intent or desire to die.
   - After weighing the guidelines, the lack of explicit suicidal intent or desire to die pushes this toward 'indicator,' but the specificity of substances makes a strong case for 'ideation.' However, the rule states to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit mention of suicide.
   - Final decision: Since ""suicide"" or ""wanting to die"" is not explicitly stated, and the post could be interpreted as a hypothetical question, I will classify it as 'indicator' to adhere to the rule of caution.
   - Correction: Upon re-reading the definitions, 'ideation' includes explicit expressions of not wanting to be alive, and while ""would this kill me"" is close, it’s still ambiguous. However, the specificity of means suggests this might be more than just a vague thought. I reconsider and note that 'ideation' can include thoughts about dying without a plan. Given the detailed list of substances, I lean toward 'ideation.'
   - Final reconciliation: The rule is clear—without explicit mention of suicide or desire to die, it should be 'indicator.' But the context (specific drugs and quantities) strongly suggests suicidal thought. I will go with 'ideation' because the post goes beyond vague distress and into specific curiosity about lethal means, which aligns with thoughts of not wanting to be alive, even if not directly stated.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?

I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of severe distress, hopelessness, and feeling at the ""end of my rope."" There are mentions of struggling lifelong, severe anxiety, isolation from friends, and feeling worthless. The post also references reaching out for help, being in the ER, and a transport to another hospital, as well as frustration with the mental health system.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of hopelessness (""light has disappeared""), worthlessness, and despair (""I just can't continue"").
   - Mentions of death: There is a reference to ""fear of non-existence after death"" not deterring them anymore, and statements like ""I can't keep going like this"" and ""it feels like I just can't continue.""
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The note written today is not explicitly identified as a suicide note.
   - No references to past attempts; the ER and hospital stay are not clearly linked to a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. There is no direct statement of wanting to die or commit suicide.
   - There are indirect expressions of not wanting to continue living (""I can't keep going like this,"" ""feels like I just can't continue""), and the fear of death no longer deterring them suggests thoughts of death or dying. However, without explicit mention of suicide or a clear intent to end their life, this leans toward 'indicator.'
   - As per the rule, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation are evident. The note mentioned is not explicitly a suicide note, and no other preparatory actions are described.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this does not qualify for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and struggles, with no specific reference to past suicide attempts. The ER and hospital transport are mentioned but not linked to a specific suicide attempt.
   - No past attempts are described, so 'attempt' does not apply.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains strong expressions of hopelessness and despair, with vague references to not continuing and thoughts of death. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die, nor any specific plan or past attempt described.
   - Per the guidelines, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the classification should be 'indicator,' even with significant distress or vague thoughts of death. The rule to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt applies here.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'indicator' as there is no direct or explicit mention of suicidal thoughts or intent.

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - The post describes a physical injury (falling from a tire swing) and subsequent medical issues (concussion, post-concussion syndrome, head inflammation, etc.).
   - Emotional indicators include feeling ""hopeless"" and not knowing what to do anymore due to persistent symptoms and lack of effective treatment.
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations related to suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
   - Since there is no mention of suicide or desire to die, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no indication of any suicidal planning or behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes past events (injury 7 months ago) and current ongoing symptoms.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses distress and hopelessness related to physical health issues but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or suicidal plans. Per the guidelines, even significant hopelessness without explicit suicide mention falls under 'indicator'. There is no indication of ideation, behavior, or past attempts.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'indicator'.

I'm a self-absorbed whiny piece of shit who can't or doesn't want to take the initiative to make my life better, all I can do is frustrate the people who *might* want to see me get better because I don't want to get better, I don't *deserve* to get better, I deserve a fucking bullet in my head. All I can do is bitch and moan about my life but do I ever try and make things better? NO, I complain about being lonely but do I reach out to people? NO, even if I did, would it make a difference?

I know I suck, everyone who cares to see it knows that I suck, I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include strong self-hatred, expressions of deserving to die, and wishing for death (e.g., ""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve a bullet in my head,"" ""slit my throat"").
   - Emotional indicators are present: hopelessness (""there is no better, this is it""), despair, self-loathing (""I'm a self-absorbed whiny piece of shit,"" ""I'm a monster"").
   - No specific plans or methods for suicide are mentioned; the references to ""bullet in my head"" and ""slit my throat"" are figurative expressions of wanting to die rather than concrete plans or preparations.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned with phrases like ""I deserve to die"" and ""I deserve to be dead.""
   - There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""slit my throat"").
   - The intent is clear, so it goes beyond a vague indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods or plans are mentioned; the references to ""bullet"" and ""slit throat"" are not tied to actionable plans or preparations.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, it leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and desires, not past events or future concrete intentions.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, fitting the definition of 'ideation.'
   - It lacks any specific plan or preparation, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - The strong emotional distress and explicit mentions of wanting to die rule out 'indicator.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation.'

And who wants to be with a sad man? Noone. So that's my company, forever. Noone. I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death/dying: The user states, ""I will die alone"" and ""the second they're gone, so am I,"" indicating thoughts of death or not being alive in the future.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and emptiness (""I'm only alive by obligation,"" ""I'm a hideous fucking mutant,"" ""I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or direct phrases like ""kill myself"" are not used. However, there are indirect references to not being alive (""so am I [gone]"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user implies a desire to not be alive after their parents are gone (""the second they're gone, so am I"").
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the mention of not being alive is not fully explicit as ""suicide,"" the intent to not live is clear enough to consider beyond just a vague feeling.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or specific ways to end their life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan or method is mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and a future intention (""the second they're gone, so am I""), not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains an implied desire to not be alive (""so am I [gone]""), which aligns with explicit suicidal thoughts, even if the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, per the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I reconsidered. The statement is strong enough to indicate a desire to die, pushing it beyond just vague distress or hopelessness.
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'
   - There is no reference to past attempts, so it does not qualify as 'attempt.'
   - Given the explicit expression of not wanting to be alive in the future, even without a direct mention of suicide, the post fits 'ideation' better than 'indicator.' However, adhering to the rule of choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicitness, I note the statement ""so am I [gone]"" is a clear enough expression of intent to die.
   - Final reasoning: The post expresses a desire to not be alive, which meets the threshold for 'ideation' as it is beyond just vague distress or general hopelessness.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death/suicide: There are multiple explicit references to suicide and self-harm by the parents, such as ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""just shoot yourself already,"" and references to past attempts like ""did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""are you going to cut your wrists again?""
   - Emotional indicators: The post reflects significant emotional distress through the harsh, abusive language from the parents, accusations of being a problem, and dismissal of the user's feelings (e.g., ""stop it with this shit,"" ""disappointing"").
   - Specific plans or methods: Methods like ""take a gun and kill yourself"" and ""shoot yourself"" are mentioned, but these are said by the parents, not the user. The user themselves does not express any personal intent or plan.
   - References to past attempts: There are mentions of past behaviors like ""did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""cut your wrists again?"" attributed to the user by the parents, suggesting historical actions.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times by the parents.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user does not personally express a desire to die or not be alive. All mentions of suicide are from the parents' statements, not the user's own thoughts or intentions.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since the user does not express personal suicidal thoughts, this leans toward 'indicator' unless past attempts are confirmed as the focus.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, methods like guns and shooting are mentioned, but only by the parents, not as a plan or intent from the user.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of preparation or planning by the user themselves.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since the user does not mention any personal plan or preparation, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post includes references to past attempts (e.g., ""did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""cut your wrists again?"") as perceived by the parents. There are no current or future intentions expressed by the user.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The references to past attempts are vague and mentioned by the parents, not detailed or confirmed by the user as concrete actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not contain explicit suicidal thoughts or desires from the user themselves, only references by others (parents). Per the rule that suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, the user's lack of personal expression of suicidal intent leans toward 'indicator.'
   - However, the repeated references to past attempts by the parents (e.g., ""did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""cut your wrists again?"") suggest a history of suicidal behavior or attempts attributed to the user. Since the category 'attempt' focuses on past actions and the post refers to past attempts (even if mentioned by others), this fits the definition of 'attempt.'
   - There is no current plan or ideation expressed by the user, ruling out 'behavior' and 'ideation.'
   - Given the rule to label as 'attempt' if past attempts are mentioned (even alongside current context, though none exists here), 'attempt' seems the most appropriate classification despite the lack of detail or confirmation from the user.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is an explicit mention of killing oneself with the phrase ""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""
   - Emotional indicators suggest distress and a desire to end life, as seen in ""I just need a way to Kim's"" (likely a typo for ""end it"" or similar).
   - The user is seeking specific information about methods (""least painful way""), which suggests intent to find a means to commit suicide.
   - No references to past attempts are mentioned.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the direct question about killing oneself.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post clearly indicates a desire to end life by asking for methods.
   - Since it is explicit, this leans away from 'indicator'.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no mentions of notes, acquiring means, or other concrete steps.
   - Since there is no explicit plan or preparation mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current or future intentions, as the user is seeking information now.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts with a clear desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - While the user is asking about methods, no specific plan, tool, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

   - Since it is explicit, this leans away from 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, writing a ""suicidal note"" suggests preparation or an action related to suicide planning.
   - Although the plan is not detailed (e.g., no specific method), the mention of a note is a concrete preparatory step, leaning toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a current or future action (""I think I'm going to write"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?

   - While there is no detailed method or plan beyond the note, the act of writing a suicidal note is a preparatory behavior associated with suicide planning.
   - According to the definition of 'behavior,' even a brief mention of a plan or preparation (like a suicide note) qualifies as 'behavior.'
   - Since there is no reference to past attempts, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'behavior.'

I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut).

I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of suicide (""shoot myself in the head"") and a specific method (using ""dad's handgun"").
   - Emotional indicators show intent to die but also hesitation due to fear of disability.
   - A specific plan or method is mentioned (handgun, shooting in the head).
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""shoot myself in the head"").
   - Direct expression of wanting to die: Yes (""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific method mentioned: Yes (handgun, shooting in the head).
   - Signs of preparation: Not explicitly mentioned (no indication of acquiring the gun or other concrete steps taken yet).
   - Although there is hesitation, the mention of a specific method (handgun) leans toward a plan being articulated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current or future intentions, not past events.
   - No past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a specific method (handgun, shooting in the head), which aligns with the definition of 'behavior' as it includes a plan, even if hesitation is expressed.
   - Although no concrete preparation (e.g., acquiring the gun) is mentioned, the specificity of the method pushes this beyond mere 'ideation'.
   - It does not fit 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mention, nor 'attempt' as there is no reference to past actions.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'behavior' due to the explicit plan mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Strong emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, anger, and sadness are present (e.g., ""my life isn’t worth living anymore,"" ""I can’t see myself having a life worth living,"" ""life has become unbearable"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, while there are strong expressions of hopelessness and statements like ""my life isn’t worth living,"" there is no direct mention of wanting to die or end one’s life.
   - Since it’s unclear and there’s no explicit mention of suicide, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances related to suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there’s no explicit planning, 'ideation' would be considered over 'behavior,' but given the lack of explicit suicidal intent, 'indicator' is more appropriate.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings of hopelessness and despair, with no reference to past attempts or future plans for suicide.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to die. There are no plans, methods, or past attempts mentioned. As per the guidelines, even strong dissatisfaction with life and hopelessness falls under 'indicator' when suicide or killing oneself is not explicitly mentioned. Since there’s no direct reference to suicide, and the rule is to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt, this post best fits the 'indicator' category.

If you are mental ill or suicidal and still want kids go for it I won't judge, you may be a good parent",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" are present, indicating a reference to suicidal ideation.
   - Emotional indicators include general dissatisfaction with the world, pessimism, suffering, and mental illness, reflecting distress and hopelessness.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post mentions ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post does not express a personal desire to die or not be alive; it only references suicidal thoughts in a general or reflective context.
   - Since the mention of suicidal thoughts is explicit but not tied to a personal desire to die, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit personal intent.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances related to suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable, and I would lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if there were ambiguity, but the lack of personal intent leans toward 'indicator.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" in a reflective or general sense, not tied to current or future intentions to act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no descriptions of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" which suggests a potential for 'ideation.' However, there is no direct expression of a personal desire to die or not be alive; the reference seems more general or observational rather than a personal statement of intent. The guidelines specify that if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned as a personal desire, I should choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.' Additionally, there is no plan or behavior mentioned, ruling out 'behavior,' and no past attempts, ruling out 'attempt.' Given the emphasis on explicit personal intent in the definitions, I will classify this as 'indicator' due to the lack of a clear, personal expression of wanting to die.

I'm done being this sad fucked up person. If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out. It feels like only viable solution",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of suicide (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"") and a desire to not be alive (""maybe I wasn't cut out for life""). 
   - Emotional indicators are present, such as hopelessness (""it just feels like nothing's gonna work"") and despair (""I'm done being this sad fucked up person"").
   - There is a mention of a specific time for a potential act (""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday"") and an indication of planning (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out"").
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes (""If I kill myself"", ""maybe I wasn't cut out for life"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are not mentioned (no tools, locations, or substances are specified).
   - There are signs of preparation or intent to plan (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out""), but it remains vague as no concrete method or means are described.
   - Since the planning is not explicit in terms of method or means, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guideline.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday"").
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - While there is a mention of planning and a specific time (birthday), there is no concrete method or means described, so it does not fully meet the criteria for 'behavior' (as per the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when unsure about explicit planning).

Now I'm just fighting this battle alone. So what is the point anymore I've failed",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of deep depression, self-blame, and feelings of being a burden to family. The post mentions ""thinking of ending it all,"" which suggests thoughts of suicide or death.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, guilt, and loneliness (e.g., ""I don't deserve love or happiness,"" ""all I deserve is pain and loneliness,"" ""what is the point anymore"").
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for ending life.
   - No references to past attempts are present.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned by name, but the phrase ""ending it all"" strongly implies a desire to die or not be alive.
   - There is a direct expression of not seeing a point in continuing (""what is the point anymore"") and contemplating ending life, which leans toward suicidal ideation.
   - Since it is not entirely vague but implies a desire to die, I will consider this as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts rather than just an indicator.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and thoughts (""now I'm just fighting this battle alone,"" ""I've been thinking of ending it all"").
   - There is no mention of past attempts or historical actions related to suicide.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to end life (""ending it all""), which goes beyond vague distress or hopelessness and qualifies as suicidal ideation.
   - Since there is no mention of a specific plan or method, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.'
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Given the explicit mention of wanting to end life without a plan, the best category is 'ideation.' If there were any doubt about explicitness, I would lean toward 'indicator,' but the phrasing here is clear enough to classify as 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death: The post explicitly refers to ""my death"" and implies an intention to end their life with phrases like ""I want to get it over with"" and ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend.""
   - Emotional indicators: There is a sense of finality and resignation (""once and for all""), as well as concern for their mother’s emotional state after their death.
   - Specific plans or methods: The post mentions a timeline (""this weekend"") and preparation (""get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents"").
   - References to past attempts: There are no mentions of past attempts; the focus is on a future action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""my death"" and ""attempt this weekend,"" which strongly imply suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a clear desire to end their life with ""I want to get it over with"" and references to their own death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method or tool (e.g., drugs, weapons) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, there is mention of preparing a will to distribute assets, which indicates planning for death, and a specific timeline (""this weekend"") is provided.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Although no specific method is mentioned, the timeline and preparation of a will suggest some level of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to future intentions (""this weekend"") and current planning (preparing a will).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal intent (""my death,"" ""attempt this weekend""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There is a clear desire to die, which aligns with 'ideation,' but the mention of a specific timeline (""this weekend"") and preparation (preparing a will) suggests some level of planning, leaning toward 'behavior.'
   - Since no specific method (e.g., tools, locations) is mentioned, there is uncertainty about whether this constitutes a detailed plan. Per the rules, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
   - There are no past attempts mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit suicidal thoughts and the presence of some planning (timeline and will), but lacking a specific method, I lean toward 'behavior' due to the preparatory actions and timeline. However, adhering to the guideline of choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' when unsure about explicit planning, I will classify this as 'ideation' since no specific method is mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and dying are present: ""whether or not I'll live till October,"" ""I don't wanna die,"" ""cannot live if I fail,"" and references to past methods of self-harm or suicide (""no access to my meds,"" ""no place to jump from,"" ""blades I used to cut"").
   - Emotional indicators include ambivalence about living or dying, a sense of purpose or happiness (""almost happy,"" ""enjoying doing stuff""), and some distress tied to a test and potential failure.
   - Specific methods or past behaviors are referenced: meds, jumping, and cutting with blades, though these seem tied to past or inaccessible means rather than current plans.
   - No clear mention of past attempts as concrete actions, only references to past methods or thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned indirectly through phrases like ""whether or not I'll live till October"" and ""cannot live if I fail."" There is also a direct statement of ""I don't wanna die,"" which implies past or potential thoughts of dying.
   - There is no clear, direct expression of a current desire to die, as the person states they don’t want to die and have things they want to do. However, the conditional ""cannot live if I fail"" suggests a potential suicidal thought tied to a future event. Since it’s not a definitive current desire, I lean toward caution but recognize the explicit mention of living/dying.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are mentioned: meds, jumping from a place, and cutting with blades. However, these are framed as inaccessible or insufficient (""no access to my meds,"" ""no place to jump from,"" ""blades won’t go that deep""), indicating no current plan or preparation.
   - There are no signs of active preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). The focus is on the absence of means rather than intent to use them now.
   - Since there is no explicit current planning, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to both current feelings (""I don’t wanna die,"" ""I’m almost happy"") and future conditional thoughts (""cannot live if I fail""). References to methods seem tied to past experiences or hypothetical situations rather than current intentions.
   - There is no specific description of past attempts as concrete actions; mentions of meds, jumping, or cutting are vague and not confirmed as past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit mentions of death and dying (""whether or not I'll live,"" ""cannot live if I fail""), which pushes it beyond 'indicator' since these are tied to the person’s own life and potential suicidal thoughts.
   - There is no clear current desire to die, as the person expresses a wish to keep doing things and not wanting to die, but the conditional language about failure suggests suicidal ideation.
   - There is no specific plan or preparation for suicide; the mentioned methods are framed as inaccessible or insufficient, so 'behavior' does not apply.
   - There is no description of past attempts as concrete actions, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to explicit expressions of thoughts about living or dying, without a specific plan or past attempt.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current thoughts and potential future actions, not past events.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - Specific methods are mentioned (slitting wrists, shooting), which aligns with 'behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts with a plan or method, even if preparation is not detailed.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death, dying, and suicide are explicit and frequent. The user states, ""I wanna kill myself,"" and discusses suicidal thoughts as a ""constant companion"" and a ""hobby.""
   - Emotional indicators include intense hopelessness, self-hatred, despair, and guilt (e.g., ""I hate myself,"" ""I don't deserve the release of death,"" ""Idiot. Disappointment. Coward."").
   - Specific plans and methods are detailed extensively: ingesting isopropyl alcohol for poisoning, testing attachment points for a noose, considering jumping in front of a car (though ruled out), and planning to avoid family interference during the act.
   - No references to past attempts are made; the focus is on current thoughts and planning.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""contemplating suicide"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes (""I want to die because I hate myself"").
   - No ambiguity here; the intent is clear.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are mentioned: Yes (isopropyl alcohol poisoning, noose attachment points, jumping in front of a car).
   - Signs of preparation are evident: Yes (calculating alcohol amounts, testing noose points, timing family absence, ruling out certain methods to avoid traumatizing others).
   - The planning is explicit and detailed, not vague.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current and ongoing thoughts and planning, not past events.
   - No past attempts are described; the focus is on current ideation and preparation.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - It goes beyond mere ideation due to the detailed plans and preparations (specific methods like alcohol poisoning and noose, testing feasibility, planning around family schedules), which align with 'behavior.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit planning and preparation, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category over 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of deep emotional distress, hopelessness, and feeling abandoned or unloved. The post mentions ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" and ""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death.""
   - Emotional indicators are strong, with mentions of mental destruction, pain, loneliness, and irreparable damage.
   - There is a vague reference to finality with ""one last record for me to make and it's finally over,"" but no specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts by the poster, though a loved one’s suicide is mentioned (not relevant to the poster's risk classification).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no direct terms like ""kill myself"" or ""commit suicide"").
   - There are direct expressions of wanting to not be alive, such as ""I'm over life"" and ""give in to the nothingness that is death."" However, per the rules, since suicide is not very explicitly mentioned, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident. The mention of ""one last record"" is vague and does not indicate a concrete plan.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if suicide were explicitly mentioned, but given the lack of explicit mention, 'indicator' is more appropriate.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and a possible future sense of finality (""it's finally over""), but there are no specific timelines or plans.
   - No past attempts by the poster are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains strong expressions of hopelessness and a desire to not be alive (""give in to the nothingness that is death""), which might suggest 'ideation.' However, per the rules, suicide must be very explicitly mentioned to move beyond 'indicator.' Terms like ""death"" and ""over life"" are vague and not direct mentions of suicide or killing oneself.
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, ruling out 'behavior.'
   - There are no past attempts described, ruling out 'attempt.'
   - Given the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, this post fits best as 'indicator' despite the strong emotional distress and vague references to death.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a desire to die with the intention of causing pain to the poster's mother.
   - Emotional indicators include anger, frustration, and a sense of being belittled, along with a wish to die.
   - There is no mention of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide.
   - No references to past attempts are made.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used), but there is a direct expression of wanting to die (""I want to die"").
   - There is a clear expression of not wanting to be alive, tied to causing pain to someone else.
   - Since it is a direct expression of wanting to die, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator', despite the lack of the explicit term ""suicide"".
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes or acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, it leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I want to die""), not past events or future specific plans.
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die, which fits the definition of 'ideation'.
   - It does not fall under 'indicator' because there is a clear desire to not be alive, even if the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - It does not qualify as 'behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan or preparation.
   - It does not qualify as 'attempt' because there is no reference to past actions.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of death and dying (""I just want my death to come faster""), self-harm behaviors (""I've started to try and starve myself""), and suicidal thoughts (""I'd prefer having access to a gun though, at least that would be quicker, painless, and more deadly"").
   - Emotional indicators show extreme hopelessness, despair, and self-loathing (""I'm truly useless,"" ""I can't do anything right,"" ""I'm a nuisance"").
   - Specific methods and plans are mentioned: starving oneself with a timeline (""dead by the end of the week"") and a preference for a quicker method like a gun.
   - No references to past attempts are made; the focus is on current thoughts and actions.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""hanging myself"" and desiring a gun for a quicker death.
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I just want my death to come faster"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are mentioned: starving oneself and a gun as a preferred method.
   - Signs of preparation or intent are present with the mention of starving oneself with a specific timeline (""dead by the end of the week"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current intentions and actions (starving oneself now with a goal of death by the end of the week).
   - There are no specific descriptions of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and desires to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of specific methods (starving, gun) and a timeline for death, which aligns with planning.
   - Since there are no past attempts described, 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Given the explicit mention of methods and a timeline, 'behavior' is the most fitting category as it includes both suicidal thoughts and evidence of planning.

445,"Melancholy. Work sleep work sleep work sleep. I just don't want to go on anymore. It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up. I deserve a chance to show everyone exactly how bad I've been hurting, and fuck you if you think I'm selfish. I just need a chance to help myself. I need to be able to feel at least some small happiness again. How do I go on?",2,behavior,"<thinking>

I was raped for 10 years by my father and grandfather and it was recorded. I was at the police but the didn't even inform the suspect, there was no trial. nothing. ""Lack of proof"" . and they didn't even search for proof. &amp;#x200B;. I can't go on like this. I'm 27 years old.

   - Mentions of death and suicide are explicit, including standing on a chair with a rope around neck, past attempts like cutting wrists, lying on a road, and jumping in front of a train.
   - Emotional indicators include deep hopelessness, despair, feeling dirty, and being unable to go on due to past trauma (rape, abuse).
   - Specific methods and actions are described (rope, cutting wrists, lying on road, jumping in front of train).
   - Multiple references to past attempts are detailed with specific ages and methods.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""I can't go on like this,"" contemplating doing it after dinner).
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are mentioned for past actions (rope, cutting wrists, lying on road, jumping in front of train).
   - Current preparation is mentioned (stood on a chair with a rope around neck today), though the person did not follow through.
   - There is a current indication of intent (""thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it""), though no specific new plan beyond the rope incident today.

   - Past attempts are specifically described with concrete actions taken.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and detailed past attempts with specific methods, which aligns with the 'attempt' category.
   - There is a current incident (standing on chair with rope) and vague intent to possibly ""do it"" after dinner, but the focus on past concrete actions and the rule that past attempts with current plans still classify as 'attempt' lead to this category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death and dying: The user talks about dying (""if I die then I die"") and accepting death at a young age (""even if that means I die at 50 or earlier"").
   - Emotional indicators: There are expressions of hopelessness and resignation (""I feel like it's not worth pushing my life further,"" ""the future is really grim"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user mentions not going to the doctor and accepting death, but there is no explicit plan or method to end their life.
   - References to past attempts: There are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or direct intent to kill oneself is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a passive acceptance of death (""if I die then I die"") and a lack of desire to prolong life (""not worth pushing my life further"").
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While there is a clear expression of not caring about living longer, suicide itself is not explicitly mentioned. However, the desire to not be alive or to accept death is present, which leans toward 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not going to the doctor is mentioned, but it is not framed as a direct method or plan to end life; it is more passive neglect.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no mentions of notes, acquiring means, or other active preparations.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan or behavior indicating active steps toward suicide, so 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and a future acceptance of death, not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide, which leans toward 'indicator'. However, there is a clear expression of not wanting to prolong life and accepting death, which aligns with suicidal ideation (a desire to not be alive). There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so 'behavior' is not applicable. There are no past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable. Given the explicit expression of a desire to not be alive (albeit passively), 'ideation' seems more appropriate than 'indicator', as the definition of 'ideation' includes explicit expressions of not wanting to live, even without a plan.

Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support.

I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a direct question about drowning oneself (""Is drowning yourself painful?"") and contemplation of it as a method for death (""I think it's the best option for me"").
   - Emotional indicators suggest a desire for a peaceful death (""Sounds rather peaceful actually"") and a romanticized view of dying.
   - Specific method mentioned: drowning, with imagery of sinking to the bottom of the ocean.
   - No references to past attempts, but a conditional future intention (""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that"").
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""drowning yourself"" and the context of choosing it as an option for death (Yes).

   - The focus is on current thoughts and a conditional future plan.
   
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a specific method (drowning), which aligns with the 'behavior' category due to the mention of a plan/method, even if conditional and not immediate.
   - It is not just 'ideation' because a specific method is described with some detail.
   - It is not 'attempt' as there is no reference to past actions.
   - It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

453,Star Wars just gave me a reason not to kill myself :). So Disney just announced they'll be releasing a Star Wars dozen films/tv shows in the coming years and it's all I've ever wanted in life :) That should hopefully postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so lol. I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is an explicit mention of ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts.""
   - Emotional indicators include a mix of positivity (""it's all I've ever wanted in life"") and a reference to postponing suicidal thoughts, suggesting underlying distress or past ideation.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - There is a vague reference to ""suicide attempts"" being postponed, but no description of past actions or concrete attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, there is a reference to not killing oneself currently due to a reason (Star Wars releases), implying past or potential future thoughts of wanting to die.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any concrete means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning or method, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to postponing potential ""suicide attempts"" for the future (""next decade or so"") and implies past or current thoughts of suicide, but there is no description of a past concrete attempt.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, ""suicide attempts"" are mentioned in a future hypothetical sense, not as a past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and implies thoughts of not wanting to be alive without a current intent due to a positive reason (Star Wars releases). However, there is no specific plan or method mentioned, ruling out 'behavior.' There is also no description of a past concrete attempt, ruling out 'attempt.' Since suicide is explicitly mentioned with a reference to not wanting to die currently but potentially in the future, this fits 'ideation' as it reflects suicidal thoughts without a plan.

I've probably slept an hour every night for I dont even know how many nights anymore. The landlord had one of em call or the landlord himself called and reported the dead body smell. No smell was found by the cops. I'm so tired. My heads messing with me. I just wanna leave this place. I got diagnosed with MS recently it's hard to deal. I just know I'm gonna be wakened if I fall asleep. It never fails. I cant take this torture from these people. I want to leave. I have no money to just walk out or i would. I dont know what options I have left. I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There is a mention of a ""Dead Body"" smell, but it is in the context of a complaint made by the landlord, not a personal reference to death or dying by the poster.
   - Emotional indicators include extreme tiredness, distress, frustration, hopelessness (""I can't take this torture,"" ""this is hell,"" ""just here to suffer""), and a desire to escape the situation (""I just wanna leave this place"").
   - There are no specific mentions of suicide, self-harm, or wanting to die.
   - No plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts at suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The desire to ""leave this place"" appears to refer to moving out of the apartment rather than a desire to end life, given the context of financial constraints and landlord issues.
   - Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no mention of planning or methods, 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post discusses current distress and ongoing issues with the landlord and neighbors.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape the current situation, but there is no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or a desire to die. The reference to ""leave this place"" is likely about physically leaving the apartment rather than ending life. There are no plans or past attempts mentioned. Therefore, this fits the 'indicator' category as it lacks explicit suicidal content, even though there is strong dissatisfaction and emotional distress.

   - Key elements include expressions of loneliness, failure, and distress (""lonely bastard,"" ""fucked it up,"" ""tired of failing everyone"").
   - There is an explicit mention of ""ending it all on New Year's Eve,"" which strongly suggests suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present (""beautiful downward spiral,"" ""can't do another year"").
   - There is a mention of having made ""3 other suicide notes this year"" and a specific reference to ""this is the one,"" which implies preparation of a note for a potential act.
   - No specific method or means (e.g., tools, locations, substances) for ending life is mentioned beyond the timing (New Year's Eve).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""ending it all on New Year's Eve.""
   - Yes, there is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive (""ending it all,"" ""can't do another year"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods or means are mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, or locations described for the act).
   - There is a sign of preparation with the mention of having written ""3 other suicide notes"" and stating ""this is the one,"" which suggests a suicide note is prepared or in progress.
   - However, without a specific method or detailed plan beyond timing and the note, it leans away from a concrete plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""ending it all on New Year's Eve"").
   - There is a reference to past actions with ""3 other suicide notes this year,"" but no description of a past concrete attempt (e.g., overdose or specific action taken), so it does not qualify as a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""ending it all""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There is a mention of preparation (suicide note) and a specific time (New Year's Eve), but no explicit method or means is described, which makes 'behavior' less certain.
   - Per the rule, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.' The lack of a specific method supports classifying this as 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'
   - Since there is no description of a past concrete attempt, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation' due to explicit suicidal thoughts without a clear, specific plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""last night"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, this describes self-harm, not a suicide attempt.

   - The post describes distress and self-harm, but per the rules, without explicit suicidal intent, it falls under 'indicator'.

   - However, the lack of a specific method or means (e.g., no mention of how they intend to carry out the act) creates uncertainty about whether this fully meets the criteria for 'behavior.' Per the rules, if unsure about explicit planning, 'ideation' is preferred over 'behavior.'
   - There is no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit suicidal thoughts but lack of a clear, specific method or means, the post seems to fit 'ideation' more conservatively under the guideline to err toward 'ideation' when uncertain about planning.

   - Mentions of suicide explicitly with the question ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.""

   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is directly used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly, though there is a reference to avoiding killing oneself (""i have to so i dont kill myself"") which implies some level of suicidal thought.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans away from 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no tools, locations, or substances mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post seems to reflect current feelings and thoughts about suicide, not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide, ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There are no specific plans or methods mentioned, ruling out 'behavior.'
   - There are no references to past attempts, ruling out 'attempt.'

   - Emotional indicators show despair and self-criticism (""too much of a coward"").
   - There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide.
   - No references to past attempts are present.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned by term, but there is a direct expression of wanting to die (Yes).
   - The desire to not be alive is clearly stated (Yes).
   - Since there is a clear expression of wanting to die, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts with a clear desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'ideation.'

Therefore, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category.

But now i am at peace, no longer in pain, locked in the bathroom while my friends text me endlessly about how im ""ignoring"" them, but in reality i dont have the confidence to even say a word to them knowing it might as well be my last.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, it leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current thoughts and struggles, not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions thoughts of suicide, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - There are no specific plans or methods mentioned, ruling out 'behavior'.
   - There is no mention of past attempts, ruling out 'attempt'.

478,Another day of being mute. Three hours of lying in bed while bf plays video games in the other room. Everyday is the same. Today I get to wear ugly clothes my mom didn't want and meet my bfs friend for drinks. Nothing to say ever. Graying hair always pulled back. I'm 40 and unemployed. I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge. Can't sleep. No future.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mention of suicide with the statement ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday.""
   - Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present: ""Nothing to say ever,"" ""No future,"" and general dissatisfaction with life.
   - Specific plan mentioned: ""Bridge"" as a location for the act.
   - No references to past attempts, only current intention.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""I'm really going to try and kill myself"").
   - Direct expression of wanting to die: Yes (""kill myself"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific method/location mentioned: Yes (""Bridge"").
   - No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), but a specific location and timeframe (""Monday"") are provided.
   - Since a specific location is mentioned, this leans toward a plan.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to a future intention (""Monday""), not past events.
   - No past attempts described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit mention of suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere thoughts of not wanting to live due to the mention of a specific location (""Bridge"") and a timeframe (""Monday""), which indicates a plan, ruling out 'ideation'.
   - The mention of a specific method/location fits the definition of 'behavior' as it includes explicit planning.
   - No past attempts are mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Based on the definitions and rules, 'behavior' is the best fit since there is an explicit plan mentioned, even if briefly.

479,Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track. Tried to sleep but then changed the wallpaper. Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms. Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it. And it's just can't get this girl out of my head. Good fore to stay away though. Not cool to start something and then  just kms. Gah but it's so hard. One of the hardest decisions I've taken iny life. Wish I have more sex before I go though lol. Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of suicide: The post explicitly refers to ""kms"" (kill myself) multiple times, indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: There is a sense of struggle and difficulty (""one of the hardest decisions,"" ""it's so hard""), as well as general dissatisfaction with life (""being non-religious in a religious country is HARDDD"").
   - Specific plans or methods: The mention of setting a wallpaper to a ""hangman's noose"" could suggest a method or symbolic reference to suicide, but it is not clear if this is an actual plan or preparation.
   - References to past attempts: The post mentions having ""recently overcame a big hurdle to kms,"" which might imply a past barrier to suicide rather than a past attempt, but it is not a clear description of a concrete past action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kms"" (kill myself) is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the repeated mention of ""kms"" and planning around it (""now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"") indicates a desire to die.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this cannot be classified as 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The ""hangman's noose"" wallpaper could be interpreted as a reference to a method (hanging), but it is not explicitly stated as a plan or preparation (e.g., acquiring a rope or setting a location). It seems more symbolic or thematic.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are no clear signs of concrete preparation like acquiring means, writing notes, or specifying a time/place. The mention of ensuring ""my mom won't be on the street"" could imply some planning for after the act, but it is vague and not tied to a specific method.
   - Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, I will lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily discusses current or future intentions (""when I do it,"" ""wish I have more sex before I go""), with a vague reference to overcoming a past hurdle, but not a specific past attempt.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there is no clear description of a concrete past action like an overdose or other attempt. The ""hurdle"" is ambiguous and does not confirm a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die (""kms""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - There is no clear, specific plan or preparation for suicide (the ""hangman's noose"" wallpaper is symbolic rather than concrete), so 'behavior' is not the best fit. When in doubt, the rule is to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' which applies here.
   - There is no definitive description of a past attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best category is 'ideation,' as it reflects explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of despair and hopelessness (""Can't take it anymore,"" ""I feel like I failed my son,"" ""I'm worthless as fuck"").
   - There is a vague reference to death or ending things (""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"").
   - Emotional indicators show significant distress and self-deprecation.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned; the phrase ""getting it over with"" is vague and could imply suicidal thoughts but does not directly state a desire to die or commit suicide.
   - There is a subtle implication of not wanting to be around (""he'll be better off without me""), but it is not a direct expression of wanting to die.
   - Since it is unclear, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, 'behavior' is not applicable. If there is uncertainty, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but given the lack of explicit suicidal intent, I lean toward 'indicator.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and thoughts; there is no mention of past events or attempts.
   - No past attempts are described, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows significant distress and hopelessness, with a vague reference to ""getting it over with,"" which could imply suicidal thoughts. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire to die, and no specific plan or method is mentioned.
   - Per the guidelines, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the classification should be 'indicator' over 'ideation.' The mention of ""getting it over with"" is not sufficiently clear to classify as 'ideation.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'indicator' since the post lacks explicit suicidal content.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death, dying, and suicide are explicit and frequent, including phrases like ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die,"" and detailed accounts of past and current actions.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, loneliness, anxiety, numbness, and depersonalization (""lifelong depression,"" ""so empty,"" ""scared of dying"").
   - Specific plans, methods, and preparations are described in detail, such as an ""exit bag,"" gas valve, rope for partial suspension hanging, and past use of aspirin and a gun.
   - References to past attempts are explicit, including taking 120 aspirin pills at 15, attempting with a gun at 21, and a recent attempt with rope.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, repeatedly and directly (""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a clear desire to end their life, though they are conflicted with fear and anxiety about it.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, multiple methods are detailed: an exit bag with gas, rope for partial suspension hanging, a gun, and aspirin overdose.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user describes preparing the exit bag ""perfectly,"" researching methods (e.g., noose positioning, aiming a gun), acquiring means (rope, gun, gas), and testing the setup (turning on the gas valve).
   - There is no uncertainty here; explicit planning and preparation are evident for current actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. The post describes past attempts (aspirin at 15, gun at 21, rope recently) and current preparations with the exit bag, indicating ongoing intent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, in vivid detail for multiple instances.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, detailed plans, and preparations for a current method (exit bag with gas), which aligns with 'behavior' due to the specific planning and means described.
   - Additionally, the post describes past attempts in detail (aspirin overdose, gun, rope), which aligns with 'attempt.'
   - Per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, despite the strong elements of 'behavior' due to current planning, the presence of past attempts combined with current plans directs the classification to 'attempt.'

   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive. (Yes)
   - No need to lean toward 'indicator' as the mention is clear.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""should just end my life""), which rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death: Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""face death.""
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of frustration (""too pissed""), hopelessness (""don't even want to feel good anymore""), and embracing pain.
   - Specific plans or methods: The user mentions working out ""until I die or pass out,"" which could imply a form of self-harm or risky behavior, but it is not a clear or typical method of suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not directly mention suicide or killing oneself. ""Face death"" is vague and not an explicit reference to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user says ""face death"" and implies they might not survive (""if not, well, you know what happened""), which suggests a desire or acceptance of death.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I lean toward 'indicator,' but the expression of facing death and the implication of not surviving pushes toward 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The user mentions working out until they ""die or pass out,"" which is not a conventional or clear method of suicide but could be interpreted as risky behavior.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations like acquiring means or writing notes are mentioned.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since the method is unclear and not a direct plan for suicide, I lean toward 'ideation' if suicidal intent is considered.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current/future intentions (""gonna start working out until I die or pass out"" and ""I'll be back in 12 hours if I survived"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or killing oneself, only a vague reference to ""face death"" and a risky behavior of working out until death or passing out.
   - There is an implied desire to die or not be alive (""if not, well, you know what happened""), which aligns with ideation.
   - However, per the rule, if suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.' The mention of death is vague and not a direct statement of suicidal intent.
   - There is no clear plan or method for suicide, as working out to exhaustion is not a typical suicidal method, so 'behavior' does not apply.
   - No past attempts are mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the ambiguity and the rule to choose 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, I classify this as 'indicator.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a question about whether duloxetine (a medication) can kill, and a mention of saving pills ""for later.""
   - There is no direct mention of suicide or self-harm, but the context of asking if a drug can kill and saving pills implies a potential intent.
   - Emotional indicators are absent; the tone is neutral or curious.
   - Specific mention of pills and saving them suggests preparation or intent regarding a method.
   - No reference to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No).
   - There is no direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive (No).
   - However, the implication of saving pills ""for later"" in the context of asking if they can kill leans toward a potential suicidal intent, though it remains unclear. Per guidance, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation', but the context of a method pushes for further consideration.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned (duloxetine pills).
   - There is a sign of preparation (saving pills ""for later""), which suggests intent or planning.
   - Although the intent is not explicitly stated as suicidal, the combination of asking if the drug can kill and saving pills indicates a potential plan. Per guidance, if uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but the mention of a specific method and preparation leans toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current or future intentions (""saving for later""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die, which leans toward 'indicator'. However, the specific mention of a drug, questioning its lethality, and saving pills ""for later"" strongly suggests a plan or preparation.
   - Given the definitions, 'indicator' applies if there is no explicit suicidal intent, but the context of a method and preparation fits 'behavior' better than 'ideation' since a specific means (pills) and action (saving them) are mentioned.
   - Per the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure about explicit planning, I reconsider. However, the mention of saving pills ""for later"" in the context of lethality seems to cross into planning.
   - Balancing the guidance and content, 'behavior' seems most appropriate due to the implied plan with a specific method.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post reflects current feelings and a vague desire to ""end,"" but no past events or attempts are mentioned.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. The phrase ""I just want to end"" is vague and does not clearly indicate suicidal intent. Per the rules, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned, the classification should lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.' There are no plans or past attempts mentioned, so 'behavior' and 'attempt' are not applicable.

489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of death and dying (""I could be dead by the end of the day today"") and a reference to ""off myself,"" which implies suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include a sense of fatigue and procrastination, possibly linked to despair or lack of motivation, though not explicitly stated as hopelessness.
   - There is a specific mention of a method (""go buy the gas""), suggesting a potential means to end life.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned with phrases like ""off myself"" and ""be dead by the end of the day today."" (Yes)
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive (""I could be dead by the end of the day today""). (Yes)

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""go buy the gas""), which implies a means to commit suicide, likely referring to carbon monoxide poisoning or something similar.
   - There are no clear signs of active preparation (e.g., having already bought the gas or written a note), but the mention of needing to ""go buy the gas"" suggests a contemplated action.
   - Since there is a specific method mentioned, even if preparation is not fully clear, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current or future intentions (""by the end of the day today,"" ""if I never leave the house to go buy the gas""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""off myself,"" ""be dead by the end of the day today""), ruling out 'indicator.'
   - The mention of a specific method (""go buy the gas"") suggests a plan, even if not fully executed or prepared, which aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'
   - Since there is no mention of past attempts, 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Based on the explicit mention of suicide and a specific method, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'.
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - The best fit is 'ideation' due to explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Yes, the post explicitly talks about planning to ""kill myself"" and ""end it,"" with a specific method of hanging in a forest.
   - Emotional indicators: The user describes feeling ""done with everything,"" unmotivated, and a mix of happiness and weird feelings, but not sadness or depression.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: Yes, detailed plan to hang themselves in the highest tree of a forest, cut off a finger with an axe, and mentions having everything ready (rope, axe, car).
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are described, only current and planned actions. However, self-harm (cutting the right leg) is mentioned as a current or recent behavior to calm down.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, clear statements like ""planned to kill myself"" and ""end it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user explicitly states intentions to end their life.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging in a forest tree and cutting off a finger with an axe.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user states ""everything is ready"" and lists the rope, axe, and car.
   - No uncertainty here; the planning is explicit and detailed.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to both past struggles (self-harm, dropping classes) and current/future intentions (planning to end life in the forest).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only self-harm (cutting) is mentioned, not a past suicide attempt.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""end it"") and a detailed plan with specific methods (hanging, forest, axe, rope) and preparations (everything is ready). This goes beyond ideation and fits the definition of 'behavior' due to the clear planning and means mentioned. Although self-harm is described, it does not constitute a past suicide attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply. The focus is on current suicidal intent with a plan, making 'behavior' the most appropriate category.

We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include questioning the point of living, expressing a wish to have never been born, and stating life feels pointless.

   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. (No)
   - There is no direct expression of wanting to die; the user states they ""don't really want to die"" despite wishing they were never born. (No)

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - There are no direct mentions of suicide or self-harm as specific actions. However, there is a clear expression of emotional distress (""lol god damn am i lonely"", ""nobody fucking cares"", ""Im such a spoiled piece of shit"").
   - There is a statement ""pls fucking end me before the day"", which suggests a desire for death or not wanting to live, though it is not explicitly tied to suicide.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or a direct reference to killing oneself is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""pls fucking end me before the day"" implies a desire for death or to not be alive, though it is somewhat vague and could be interpreted as hyperbole.
   - Since it is not entirely clear if this is a direct suicidal thought or an expression of frustration, I will lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guideline.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any specific means of ending life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of notes, acquiring means, or other preparatory actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post does not explicitly mention suicide or killing oneself, though it does express a desire for death (""pls fucking end me""). As per the guideline, if there is doubt about whether suicide is explicitly mentioned, I should choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The emotional distress and loneliness are clear, but without a direct reference to suicide or a specific plan, this falls under 'indicator'. It does not meet the criteria for 'ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts with a clear desire to die), 'behavior' (specific plan or method), or 'attempt' (past actions).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include a mention of stabbings in the area and a hope to be the next victim. There is a reference to avoiding shame in the family by not committing suicide directly but rather being a victim of a stabbing. Emotional indicators include a sense of shame and a desire to avoid burdening the family.
   - There is a mention of suicide explicitly, tied to avoiding shame, and an indirect expression of wanting to die by hoping to be stabbed.
   - No specific personal plan or method for suicide is described beyond the hope of being a victim of a stabbing, which is not a direct action or preparation by the person.
   - No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly mentions ""suicide"" in the context of avoiding shame.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post expresses a hope to be the next victim of a stabbing, which implies a desire to die, though indirectly through an external event.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Stabbing is mentioned, but it is framed as an external event (hoping to be a victim) rather than a personal plan or action taken by the individual. No tools, locations, or substances are mentioned as being acquired or prepared by the person.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of personal preparation such as acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since there is no explicit personal planning or action, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current or future hopes (being the next victim of a stabbing) rather than past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no mentions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to die (hoping to be stabbed), which rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no specific personal plan or preparation for suicide described; the mention of stabbing is tied to an external event rather than a concrete method or action by the individual, so 'behavior' does not seem to fit. When uncertain about explicit planning, the rule is to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.
   - There are no references to past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Based on the explicit mention of suicide and the desire to die without a specific personal plan, 'ideation' seems the most appropriate category.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself,"" ""put an end to it all"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods, tools, substances, or locations for suicide are mentioned. The ideas of disappearing or changing identity are not concrete plans for suicide but rather ways to isolate before possibly acting.

   - Specific methods and plans are mentioned: suffocation using a mask and plastic bag, plans to try again tonight, and a reference to a ""Plan B"" that is more painful.
   - There is a clear reference to a past attempt (""I tried to kill myself last night"") with detailed description of the method used.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to both a past event (last night’s attempt) and current/future intentions (""I’m gonna try again tonight,"" ""Plan B"").
   - The past attempt is specifically described with details of the method used.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and desires to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It also includes specific methods and plans for both past and future actions, which goes beyond 'ideation'.
   - While there are current plans mentioned (which could suggest 'behavior'), the post explicitly describes a past attempt with concrete actions taken (""tried to kill myself last night via suffocation""). Per the definition, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'attempt' due to the focus on a historic action combined with current intent.
