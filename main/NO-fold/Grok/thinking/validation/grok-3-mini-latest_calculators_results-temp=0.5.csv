0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of hopelessness and self-hatred, such as ""Never will find love,"" ""Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown,"" ""Seems everything in my life is crap even me,"" ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself."" It mentions suicide-related content with ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off."" Emotional indicators include despair and worthlessness. Specific plans: ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" references a location and method. References to past attempts: ""again"" suggests possible prior suicidal thoughts or actions, but it's not detailed.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in the desire to end life and the bridge reference.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""go to a bridge and jump off"" specifies a location and method (jumping).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the mention of a specific plan indicates intent.
   - Since a specific method is described, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"") with a possible hint at past events (""again""), but the focus is on present thoughts and plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (bridge and jumping), which aligns with 'behavior.' It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of a method and location. Although ""again"" hints at the past, the post primarily describes current plans, not a detailed past attempt, so 'attempt' is not the best fit.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include emotional distress (""I'm inconsolable"") and a statement about dying (""I'm going to die soon""). There are mentions of death or dying, but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, but nothing beyond vague expressions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" suggests a possible desire to die, but it is vague and not explicit. Since it is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""going to die soon""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and a vague feeling about dying, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts. Based on the definition of 'Indicator', which includes vague feelings about death without explicit suicide references, and the rule to choose 'Indicator' when in doubt, this fits best as 'Indicator'.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: None are present; no words like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or ""kill myself"" are used.
   - Emotional indicators: There are signs of despair and hopelessness, as the post conveys hating life and regretting existence.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there's a vague implication of disliking life, it's not direct. Since it's unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there's no indication of any plan, this doesn't qualify for 'behavior'; if uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's not even at the ideation level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings of frustration rather than past events or future intentions.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it involves vague dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt about explicit mentions, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct plea for help to ""kill myself"" and a request to find ""trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal."" This mentions suicide explicitly, expresses a desire for death, and references specific substances (barbiturates/Nembutal) as potential methods. There are emotional indicators of despair, as the user is seeking assistance to end their life. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the entire post conveys this intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, as barbiturates/Nembutal are substances commonly associated with suicide. The user is asking for help to acquire them, which could indicate preparation or intent to obtain means. This goes beyond vague thoughts and suggests a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions, as the user is seeking immediate help, rather than past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (barbiturates/Nembutal), which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' as it involves planning or preparations. It is not just ideation, as a method is specified, and there are no past attempts mentioned, so it's not 'Attempt.' It exceeds 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness and pointlessness of life, such as questioning the purpose of living and stating that the user still wants to die even though problems are solved.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct phrases like ""want to kill myself"" and ""kill ourselves.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I still want to die.""
   - These are clear expressions, so this supports moving beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring items or writing a note is indicated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which fits the definition of 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to be gone, mental pain turning into physical pain, desiring for it to be over tonight, not wanting to survive it, and a need for peace. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as hating everything and not being able to handle the pain. No mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are present. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" and ""I don't wanna survive it"" indicate a desire to end one's life. Since these are direct expressions of wanting to die, even if not using the term ""suicide,"" they qualify as explicit suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is detailed, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions, specifically ""tonight,"" indicating an immediate desire rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as wanting to be gone and not survive, which fits the definition of Ideation (desire to not be alive without a specific plan). There is no mention of a plan or method, so it does not qualify as Behavior. It lacks references to past attempts, so it's not Attempt. While the expressions are strong, they do not explicitly mention suicide in name, but the desire to die is clear enough to classify as Ideation rather than Indicator.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, and stagnation, such as ""Im stuck, stagnant"" and ""I think i have an incurable disease."" There are mentions of death and suicide, including ""I want to call it a day and kill myself,"" ""I want to die now,"" and references to others wanting to ""shoot their heads off,"" which implies self-harm thoughts. Emotional indicators show deep despair and isolation. Specific plans or methods are mentioned, like ""run towards a cop with a knife"" or ""find a dealer with some opioids."" There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""I want to die now."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I want to die now"" and the desire to ""erase all traces of my existence."" This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including ""run towards a cop with a knife"" (method: knife) and ""find a dealer with some opioids"" (substance: opioids). These indicate potential plans for suicide. There are no explicit signs of preparation like acquiring items, but the mention of specific methods qualifies as planning. Since methods are clearly referenced, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions, such as ""I want to die now"" and the options for actions. There are no descriptions of past attempts; it's focused on the present and potential future.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die now"") and specific methods (e.g., knife or opioids), which aligns with the 'behavior' category as it involves explicit planning. It does not fit 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'ideation' because of the specific plans, or 'attempt' since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user's schizo-affective disorder, lack of sleep due to paranoia about being hurt, feelings of deterioration, a desire to ""get it over with,"" fear of being hospitalized, and specific concern about the pain involved in ""going through with it."" 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There are indirect references, such as ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""the pain if I go through with it,"" which imply a desire to end one's life, though not explicitly stated as suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The post shows hopelessness, despair, paranoia, and fear, indicating severe distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are mentioned, nor are there signs of preparation.

   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While not crystal clear, the context strongly implies suicidal thoughts, so this qualifies as explicit enough for consideration beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No indications of preparation, such as writing notes or acquiring items.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is evident, this does not reach 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings and potential future actions (e.g., ""going through with it""), with no reference to past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to ""get it over with"") without any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include feelings of abandonment, loneliness, self-doubt, and emotional pain. The user describes expecting people to leave, pushing them away, and reflecting on their own role in relationships. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""everyone leaves you eventually"" and ""it still hurts."" However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" might suggest a vague desire to escape, it is metaphorical and not a direct expression of suicidal intent. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of severe emotional distress, such as codependency, inability to think independently, constant anxiety, self-doubt, mistrust, feelings of being small like a child, apathy, passivity, no creativity, unhealthy relationships, loneliness, need for approval, anhedonia, dissociation, and a sense of hopelessness. There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically ""i plan to kill myself at 21."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a desire for a reset. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""i plan to kill myself at 21."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the explicit plan and overall expressions of hopelessness. This is clear, so it goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means. Are there signs of preparation? No, such as writing a note or acquiring items. Since there is a general plan (time-based: at 21) but no explicit method or preparation, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior, as per the instructions to choose 'ideation' if uncertain about explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers primarily to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., plan at 21, with the user being 18 now). There are no references to past events or attempts.

It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'Behavior' due to the lack of specific methods or preparations. It is not 'Attempt' as there are no descriptions of past actions.

   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Behavior' due to lack of planning, or 'Attempt' due to no past actions.

I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of distress about work, skills, money, housing, unfair treatment, loneliness, and feeling overwhelmed. There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically ""the only way out is suicide"" and ""I've considered hanging."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, emptiness, fear, and sensitivity. Specific plans or methods mentioned: ""I've considered hanging."" No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""the only way out is suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through statements implying a desire to escape via suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""I've considered hanging"" indicates a specific method (hanging).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs like acquiring tools or writing notes.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""hanging""), which fits the 'Behavior' category as it involves explicit expressions of thoughts along with a plan. Although no actual preparation is detailed, the mention of a method meets the criteria for 'Behavior' over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit statements about intending to kill oneself, such as ""i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it,"" indicating a strong desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and urgency, like ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year."" There are signs of preparation with ""i already got my suicidal notes ready."" No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are detailed, but the mention of ""when and how"" suggests consideration of planning. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""i'm going to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the post clearly states a decision to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no details on tools or locations), but there are signs of preparation, such as having ""suicidal notes ready."" The phrase ""just a matter of when and how"" implies intent to plan, which constitutes preparation. Based on the guidelines, this leans toward 'behavior' due to the presence of preparations.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions, such as deciding on ""when and how,"" rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and evidence of preparation (suicidal notes), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning preparations, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme dissatisfaction with the user's appearance and self-image, such as hating their face, body, and overall look. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like feeling ugly, horrible, and wishing to be someone else. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are referenced, and there are no indications of past attempts, though the user mentions past efforts to change their appearance (e.g., dyeing hair, changing clothes, altering eating habits).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the user expresses a desire to ""be someone else"" or ""press a button and be someone else,"" which implies a wish for transformation rather than ending life. Since this is not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No; the post only discusses attempts to improve appearance, not any suicide-related actions. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but there's no evidence of planning here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings of distress and past efforts to change appearance, but it does not describe past suicide attempts or indicate future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness about self-image, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. This aligns best with 'Indicator,' as per the definition that emphasizes choosing this category when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, even with significant dissatisfaction.

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post: The post discusses why others might post about killing themselves or being in the process of doing so, suggesting they are seeking help rather than genuinely wanting to harm themselves. It includes mentions of ""kill themselves"" and ""in the process of doing so,"" which refer to hypothetical or general posts by others. There are no emotional indicators of the poster's own distress, hopelessness, or despair. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts by the poster are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in the context of what others post, not the poster's own thoughts or feelings.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the poster is not expressing any personal desire; they are commenting on others.
   - Since the mentions are not about the poster, this does not qualify as explicit for the poster's risk.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - No planning is indicated for the poster.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to general or current behaviors of others, but not the poster's own past, current, or future intentions.
   - No past attempts are described for the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post does not contain any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts by the poster themselves. It is a commentary on others' posts. According to the definitions, this lacks any direct indication of the poster's suicide risk, making it 'Indicator'. The rule emphasizes that risk applies only to the person writing the post, and here, no such risk is expressed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""No point in existing,"" ""No point in being alive anymore,"" ""I'm so tired of being alive,"" and ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself."" There are explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm desires. Emotional indicators show deep sadness and tiredness. References to past attempts are present (""the past two times I've tried I've failed""), but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"" and ""No point in being alive anymore.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or preparations. Since no explicit plan is described, this leans toward ideation or attempt based on other factors, but I must choose ideation over behavior if unsure about planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to both current feelings (e.g., ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"") and past events (e.g., ""the past two times I've tried I've failed""), indicating historical actions rather than future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (""the past two times I've tried I've failed""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. Although there are current suicidal desires, the presence of past attempts takes precedence. The rules specify that if a post refers to past attempts, it should be labeled 'Attempt,' even if current ideation is mentioned, as long as it's not just thoughts but actual tries.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""killing myself"" explicitly, expresses indifference to societal judgments like ""beta male pussy"" and ""natural selection,"" and states ""I don't want to be alive."" This includes direct references to suicide and emotional indicators of hopelessness and a desire not to live. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I don't want to be alive.""
   - The mentions are clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I don't want to be alive""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die and mentioning killing oneself) but lacks any specific plan or method, so it fits 'ideation.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'behavior' due to no plan, and not 'attempt' as no past action is described.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post includes key elements such as explicit mentions of ""desire to kill myself,"" references to past overdose attempts, emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and frustration with life. It also mentions specific methods like overdoses in the past and getting hit by a train as a current idea. There are no signs of current preparations beyond ideation of methods.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""desire to kill myself"" and willingness to choose death by train.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including past overdoses and the idea of getting hit by a train. There are no explicit signs of preparation like acquiring means, but the mention of a specific method (train) indicates more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (overdose attempts in the past two weeks and six months) and current/future intentions (ongoing desire and contemplating a train as an escape).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (overdoses) and also mentions current plans (e.g., getting hit by a train). According to the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and includes current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of worry, fear, and panic about potentially having diabetes, concerns over DIY HRT (MTF transition), dependency on estrogen, and anxiety about parental reactions and personal issues. There are emotional indicators of distress, such as crying, panic attacks, and feeling overwhelmed, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" expresses strong dependency and distress, it does not explicitly indicate a desire to die or end one's life. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current worries and fears about health and life situations, with no mention of past events, past attempts, or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness about life issues, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, desires to die, or any plans.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses profound hopelessness and despair, detailing failed treatments (medications, biofeedback, therapy, EMDR, TMS), financial struggles (living on $786 a month and sometimes not eating), and repeated attempts implied by phrases like ""So I tried. And I tried again."" It concludes with ""Now it's time to end it,"" which suggests a desire to end one's life. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and exhaustion, but no specific mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm methods. No references to tools, locations, substances, or preparations are present. The phrase ""I tried"" could imply past suicide attempts, but it's ambiguous and could refer to treatments.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Now it's time to end it"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life.
   - Since this is an explicit expression of wanting to die, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as per the guidelines to consider such phrases as indicators of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is mentioned.
   - Since there's no evidence of a plan, this would not qualify as behavior; instead, it fits ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past efforts (e.g., treatments and possibly attempts via ""I tried""), but the key phrase ""Now it's time to end it"" indicates current intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The phrase ""I tried"" is vague and could mean attempts at suicide, but it's not concrete (e.g., no mention of an overdose or other action), so it doesn't clearly qualify as a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""end it""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because of the direct expression of wanting to end life. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan. It is not 'Attempt' because any potential reference to past tries is not specifically described as a concrete action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of social isolation, bullying, loneliness, and disconnection from the world. There are mentions of death and suicide: specifically, ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being an outsider. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. References to the past include ""In the pas I tried to hide this with saying 'I am misanthrope'"", which seems to refer to past coping mechanisms rather than a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user states ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the ongoing thoughts of suicide and feelings of isolation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plan or method is detailed, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing thoughts (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday""), with a vague reference to the past regarding hiding feelings, but no description of a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., daily thinking about suicide) and desires related to not wanting to live, but there is no mention of a specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal thoughts without planning. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past suicide attempt is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as dropping out of college, cutting off friends, giving up on life, excessive drinking and smoking leading to weight gain, and a lack of social or romantic life. There are mentions of not being scared to die and having decided to keep living only for family. Additionally, there are references to a plan, a note, and a specific date (early April), which suggest preparations for suicide. No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are detailed, but the note and date imply self-harm intentions. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not being scared to die, as indicated by phrases like ""I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family"" and ""There is no hell so I'm not scared to die."" Since there are clear indicators of a desire to end life, this leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts rather than just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods (e.g., guns, pills) are detailed. However, there are signs of preparation: the post mentions ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April,"" which indicates a suicide note and a set date as preparations. Given that preparations like a note are explicitly referenced, this goes beyond mere thoughts and suggests planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions, as it discusses a plan and date in early April, which is upcoming. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and mentions preparations (plan, note, and date), which align with the 'Behavior' category. It exceeds 'Ideation' due to the explicit planning elements, and there are no past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt.' It's also beyond 'Indicator' because of the clear indications of suicidal intent and preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide (""suicidal thoughts"", ""kill myself"", ""go through with it and kill myself""), self-harm (""how many cuts I have all over myself""), and emotional indicators such as hopelessness (""no one would care or miss me""), anger (""I'm like a rabid dog""), and despair (""this will probably be my last post ever""). There are no specific plans or methods described for suicide beyond a vague choice between seeking help or acting on thoughts. References to past attempts are implied through self-harm but not explicitly stated as suicide attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""kill myself"" and ""end up dead"".
   
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, or substances for suicide; it's vague (e.g., ""go through with it and kill myself"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, as the user states they ""haven't even left home yet,"" indicating no concrete actions taken.
   - Since no explicit plan with methods is described, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm still debating,"" ""this will probably be my last post ever""), not past events. No past attempts are specifically described.
   
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks specific plans or methods, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It does not qualify as 'Behavior' due to the absence of detailed planning, and the rules instruct to choose 'Ideation' if unsure.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of exhaustion and suicidal thoughts, such as ""Im so tired i can't kill myself"" and ""im suicidal."" There are mentions of death and suicide directly. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point"") and distrust in others' care. A specific method is referenced: ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there, i just can't commit to it,"" which suggests a location for jumping. No references to past attempts or preparations like acquiring tools or writing notes are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""i can't kill myself"" and ""im suicidal.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements implying a desire to end life but inability to act on it.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""good clif"" is mentioned as a potential location and method for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring means or taking immediate steps, but the reference to a specific location qualifies as a specific idea of how to commit suicide.
   - Based on the definitions, since specific ideas (ways/locations) are mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior,' but there's no clear evidence of active preparations, so I must follow the rule to consider it 'behavior' if methods are specified.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and feelings, with no mention of past events or attempts; it's focused on the present struggle.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit mentions of suicide and a specific method (cliff), which aligns with the 'behavior' category as it includes suicidal thoughts plus specific ideas of how to act, per the definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme exhaustion, self-hatred, isolation, and hopelessness, such as ""i'm tired of everything,"" ""i'm tired of hating myself,"" ""i'm tired of crying myself to sleep,"" and ""i wish i was never born."" There are mentions of emotional distress, including feelings of worthlessness and a desire for things to stop, but no references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm directly. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""i wish i was never born"" and ""i just want it all to stop"" indicate a desire not to exist, which qualifies as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - Since this is an explicit indication of not wanting to be alive, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator,' even though the word ""suicide"" isn't used.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; it remains at the level of thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post primarily refers to current feelings and ongoing experiences (e.g., daily tiredness, parents fighting), with no mention of past events or attempts. It's focused on the present state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wishing not to have been born), which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves a desire not to be alive without any specific plan. It is not 'indicator' because of the direct indication of not wanting to exist. It is not 'behavior' due to the absence of any plan or method, and it is not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in the same phrase and references to a funeral as a final act.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as writing a note or acquiring items.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I can't wait to..."" and ""It's gonna be...""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to kill oneself) but lacks any specific plan or method, which fits the definition of 'ideation'. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' due to no plan, and not 'attempt' as there are no past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""end it all,"" which implies suicide, and ""goodbye everybody,"" suggesting a farewell. Emotional indicators include readiness to end life, hopelessness (e.g., ""no one really understands,"" ""I doubt anyone will care""), and despair. There are references to a plan (""I already know how I'm gonna do it"") and timing (""gonna wait a few weeks""). It also mentions a past action (""all ready tried that before""), which seems to refer to seeking help rather than a suicide attempt.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, ""end it all"" is a clear indicator of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" indicates a specific method, and ""gonna wait a few weeks"" suggests preparation or timing.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit past suicide attempts; it refers to trying to tell others before.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""end it all"" and the overall context of wanting to end life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, phrases like ""I'm ready to just end it all"" and ""goodbye everybody"" express a desire to die.
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" implies a specific method, even if not detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""gonna wait a few weeks"" indicates timing as part of preparation.
   - This goes beyond vague thoughts, as it mentions a plan, so it aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., waiting a few weeks to act), with a minor reference to a past action (trying to tell others), but that's not a suicide attempt.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the past reference is about seeking help, not an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal expressions (e.g., desire to end it all) and mentions a specific plan (knowing how and timing it). This fits 'behavior' as it involves suicidal thoughts plus explicit planning. It's not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'ideation' due to the plan, and not 'attempt' as no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of wanting to kill oneself (""I can't even fucking kill myself""), self-harm (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it""), and expressions of being a burden, disappointment, and hopelessness (""I've been a burden my whole life,"" ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it""). Emotional indicators include despair, self-loathing, and a desire for non-existence. There are no clear references to past attempts, but it hints at current struggles with self-harm. Specific plans or methods mentioned: ""I hold the blade,"" which refers to a tool for self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as seen in the desire for self-harm and statements implying life would be better without the person.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""I hold the blade"" indicates a specific method (a blade for self-harm).
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is an implication of having the means (holding the blade), which suggests some level of preparation, even if not fully acted upon.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to current feelings and intentions (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it""), rather than past events. No explicit description of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (blade), which aligns with 'behavior' as it includes both suicidal desires and an indication of a plan or means. Although no full preparation like a note is detailed, the mention of a method qualifies it for 'behavior' over 'ideation'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the phrase ""how about i die then,"" which expresses a desire to die. Since this is a direct indication of wanting to die, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as per the guidelines to choose ideation if there's any explicit expression.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and a hypothetical future intention (e.g., ""how about i die then""), rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of a desire to die, which fits the definition of ideation (suicidal thoughts without a specific plan).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme hopelessness and despair with phrases like ""There is no hope. All is lost,"" and ""It is pointless, meaningless, and a waste of energy to even keep trying.""

Emotional indicators include deep despair and a sense of inevitability about death. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday"" and the confirmation that suicide will happen.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, substances, locations, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is mentioned. The post states uncertainty about when it will happen (""When it will happen I am unsure""), indicating no concrete plan.
   - Since no specific plan is evident, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It primarily refers to current feelings and future intentions, such as the resolve to end life before a specific date in 2023. The phrase ""At least I DID try"" could imply past efforts, but it does not describe a past suicide attempt, so it's not sufficient for the 'attempt' category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation, which fits the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions of suicide. It is not 'Behavior' because no plan is detailed, and it is not 'Attempt' as no past suicide action is described.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include feelings of weakness, betrayal by a best friend who is dating the user's ex, struggles with social advice to cut ties, giving an ultimatum, and ongoing emotional pain from being used. The user expresses hopelessness about relationships and self-doubt but does not mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user focuses on wanting normal friendships and resolution, without any indication of suicidal thoughts. Since there's no explicit mention, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There's no discussion of any suicide-related plans or behaviors, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me?

I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of deep emotional distress, such as feeling hollow, sadness, isolation, self-hatred, and a desire to not exist. There are mentions of wanting to ""not exist"" and indirect references to ending life metaphorically (e.g., ""I just want to not exist""), but no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being trapped, with no specific plans, methods, or preparations noted. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I just want to not exist"" and ""I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day,"" which indicate a desire to not be alive. Since these are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts but not crystal clear on suicide itself, I lean toward 'ideation' as it fits the definition of desires to end one's life without explicit suicide wording.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. This lacks any indication of a plan, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and ongoing emotions, with no mention of past events, attempts, or future intentions beyond general distress.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""I just want to not exist""), which aligns with 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction, so it's not 'indicator'. There's no plan or past attempt, ruling out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include repeated expressions of wanting to die, such as ""I just want to end it,"" ""I just want to die,"" and ""I hate being alive."" There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like ""I'm losing my mind,"" ""complete breakdown,"" ""I hate myself,"" ""feeling worthless,"" and ""tired of failing everything."" A specific method is mentioned: ""put a bullet right through it,"" which refers to using a gun. There are no references to past attempts or preparations like acquiring means.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I just want to end it,"" ""take my own life,"" and ""I just want to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, these are repeated throughout the post.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""put a bullet right through it"" explicitly references a gun as a method. There are no signs of preparation, such as writing a note or acquiring the means, but the mention of a specific method qualifies as part of planning. Since this is clear, it leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I just want to end it""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as desires to die, and also mentions a specific method (gun/bullet), which indicates a plan. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Behavior' because it combines suicidal ideation with an explicit plan or method. It does not qualify as 'Ideation' due to the specific method mentioned, nor as 'Attempt' since no past actions are described, and not as 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions.

   - Are there signs of preparation? The post implies consideration of a method but doesn't explicitly detail preparations like acquiring pills; however, the mention of a specific method qualifies as planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and potential future actions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

   - This refers to past events for the user (suicidal ideation and attempt in 2009), with no current or future intentions expressed. The friend's situation is current, but we classify based on the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post describes the user's past suicide attempt as a concrete action (e.g., ""very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded""), fitting the 'Attempt' category, which focuses on historic actions. There are no current suicidal thoughts or plans from the user, so it's not 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. It's not 'Indicator' because of the explicit mention of a past attempt.

39,"I'm scared therapy wont work. My parents realized 'omg hey our kid isn't really doing all that well' and now I'm going to therapy. Which is good. But I worry therapy won't work. Even on days where I'm actually happy I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts. And it's tempting a lot of the time. I'm tired of always being afraid and upset over little things, I'm tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation. I wish I could be so much better than I am so I didn't live every moment in shame. Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of fear that therapy won't work, parental concern, persistent thoughts referred to as ""kermit sewer slide"" (a slang term for suicide), temptation towards these thoughts, emotional exhaustion from fear and upset, self-criticism about laziness and lack of motivation, feelings of shame, and doubt about receiving help.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: There is a reference to ""kermit sewer slide"" thoughts, which is a common internet slang for suicidal ideation or wanting to end one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, fear, shame, and tiredness are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned; it's just about the thoughts being tempting.
   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""kermit sewer slide,"" which is a recognized euphemism for suicide, indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post describes these thoughts as tempting and persistent, implying a desire to not continue living.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the reference is slang, it is sufficiently explicit in context, so I am not leaning toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No preparations are indicated.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is present, this supports 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current thoughts and feelings, such as ongoing temptations and daily experiences.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kermit sewer slide"" thoughts and their temptation), indicating a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it?

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (""slitting my wrists""), but there are no signs of preparation, such as acquiring tools or writing a note.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" directly refers to suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Therefore, this does not qualify as having a plan, so it should not be classified as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., past depression and its impact on hygiene) and current feelings (e.g., suicidal feelings now), but there are no indications of future intentions or past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal feelings are coming back""), which fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves a desire related to not wanting to live without any specific plan.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions and feelings, as indicated by the present tense ""wants to die."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die), which fits the definition of 'ideation' since there is no specific plan or method mentioned.

There are emotional indicators such as the user's desire to express love to loved ones before leaving, along with phrases like ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""My mind's made up,"" suggesting a sense of finality and hopelessness. No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are mentioned, but preparing notes is implied as a form of preparation. There are no references to past attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post directly references ""suicide notes."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I'm leaving soon"" and the context of writing farewell letters, indicating a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user is seeking help to write suicide notes, which qualifies as a preparation for suicide based on the definition. Since this involves explicit preparation (suicide notes), it leans toward 'behavior,' but as per the rules, if uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; however, the mention of notes as preparation makes it explicit enough.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""My mind's made up,"" suggesting imminent action. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to leave and write suicide notes) and mentions preparation (suicide notes), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by indicating active steps, even if no specific method is detailed. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, pointlessness of life, dissatisfaction with societal expectations, a desire to ""disappear forever,"" and a prediction of dying by 35. There are emotional indicators of despair and frustration, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm in an explicit way. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to disappear forever"" and ""I know I will die by 35,"" which imply a desire to not exist. However, since the word ""suicide"" or direct terms like ""kill myself"" are not used, and the instructions emphasize leaning toward 'indicator' if unclear, this is a point of caution.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, nothing suggests a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., predicting death by 35), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""disappear forever""), which aligns with explicit suicidal thoughts under the Ideation category, as it involves a desire to end one's existence without a specific plan. However, given the rule to choose 'indicator' if in doubt about explicit mentions, I must carefully evaluate. The content goes beyond general dissatisfaction by directly implying a wish to cease existing, fitting the Ideation definition more than Indicator, which requires no explicit expression of suicidal feelings.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""kill yourself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""taking these pills,"" and ""trying to die.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill yourself,"" ""hanging myself,"" and ""trying to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I'm trying to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as hanging (using the shower or door frame) and taking pills. There are no clear signs of preparation like acquiring means or writing a note, but the mention of specific ways to commit suicide qualifies as explicit ideas of methods.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the language is in the present tense (e.g., ""idk if hanging myself would even work,"" ""I'm trying to die""). There are no references to past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die) and mentions specific methods (hanging and pills), which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' as it involves suicidal thoughts plus explicit planning or methods.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die, feelings of depression, numbness, and exhaustion with life. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I want to die"" and ""killing myself."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, fear of failure, and uncertainty about seeking help. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user explicitly states they do not have a specific plan. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no mention of methods or preparations, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the act of counting pills every night, expressing regret for not taking them all, and feelings of being a coward in a life where the person feels unloved and uncared for. There are mentions of pills, which could imply self-harm or suicide by overdose. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of worthlessness. There are no specific plans described beyond the ongoing behavior of counting pills, but this could suggest preparation. No references to past attempts are explicitly stated, though the regret implies prior consideration.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly, as the post expresses regret for not taking all the pills, which implies a desire to have ended their life. Since it's not entirely explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the implication is strong enough to consider further.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, pills are mentioned as a potential method (e.g., overdose). Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the routine of counting pills every night suggests ongoing engagement with a means for self-harm. If uncertain about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, the mention of a method and routine behavior indicates some level of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to ongoing and past intentions rather than a specific past attempt. The phrase ""why i didnt take them all"" points to past thoughts or missed opportunities, but it's not describing a completed attempt. It's more about current rumination on past inaction.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (regret for not taking pills, implying a desire to die) and mentions a specific method (pills) with signs of preparation (counting them nightly). This aligns with 'behavior' as it involves both thoughts and an indication of planning/preparation. Although not a full plan, the criteria for 'behavior' is met due to the method and routine, so 'behavior' fits best over 'ideation' where no method is specified.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of intense emotional distress, such as ""unbearably strong thoughts,"" a ""major downward spiral,"" and the daily struggle to wake up and get through the day. There are indicators of hopelessness and despair, but no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The reference to not wanting to end up in the psych ward again suggests a past mental health issue, but it does not explicitly describe a suicide attempt or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post describes general distress and struggles but does not explicitly state a desire to end one's life. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates preparations like writing a note or acquiring means. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's no evidence for either.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post primarily refers to current and recent events (e.g., ""lately"" and ""past few months""), with a vague hint of a past event related to the psych ward. However, no past attempts at suicide are specifically described; it's just implied through ""again.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post shows general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, plans, or past attempts. According to the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and in cases of doubt, 'indicator' is preferred over 'ideation'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress, such as feeling empty, alone, uncared for, and losing the will to live due to repeated rejections in dating.

No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I've lost all will to live"" and ""want to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user directly states a desire to die related to their mental health.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of wanting to die, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed.

   - Since there is no explicit plan, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""tried to kms yesterday,"" which is an abbreviation for ""kill myself,"" indicating a reference to suicide. It also includes emotional indicators like ""Iam depressed af,"" showing severe depression and distress. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations in the post.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through the user's admission of depression and the sarcastic response to their mom.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, ""tried to kms yesterday"" directly references a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""tried to kms,"" which is a clear reference to attempting suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied in the context of the attempt and depression.
   - Since it's explicit, no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there's no indication of a plan, but the post describes an action, this doesn't affect the category choice here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""tried to kms yesterday"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user describes trying to kill themselves yesterday.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""tried to kms yesterday""), which fits the 'Attempt' category as it focuses on historic actions. There's no mention of current plans, so it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior'. It's not just ideation or general distress, as a concrete past action is stated.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of ongoing pain and suffering for 28 years, questioning if it's karmic punishment, and a desire to end it all. There are mentions of wanting a ""non painful way to do this"" and ""I cant live anymore,"" which imply thoughts of death or dying. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""I absolutely cannot fight anymore"" and ""non stop pain and suffering."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I cant live anymore"" directly express a desire to not be alive.
   - Since there is a direct expression of wanting to die, even without the word ""suicide,"" this leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as it's not just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, only a vague reference to a ""non painful way"" is present, without detailing tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs are mentioned.
   - Since there is no explicit plan or method, this does not qualify as behavior; it should be ideation if suicidal thoughts are present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings of suffering and a desire to end life, not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not live), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with Ideation. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because of the direct statement of not wanting to live. There are no elements of planning (Behavior) or past attempts (Attempt).

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I want to kill myself next week.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - This clearly involves explicit planning, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions (""next week""), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific method (""with drugs""), and preparations (""suicide note""), which aligns with the 'behavior' category as it involves planning. It's not just ideation since a plan is present, and there's no mention of past attempts, so it's not 'attempt.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme tiredness, lack of motivation, hopelessness about life (e.g., ""life is so cyclic,"" ""I have no motivation,"" ""it's so lonely""), regret over personal behavior (e.g., pushing people away), dissatisfaction with financial and health situations (e.g., ""none of the pills do enough,"" ""working 40 hours a week to barely pay my bills""), and jealousy of others' lives. There are emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness but no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" is vague and could imply ending suffering, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life. Since it is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any preparations like writing a note or acquiring items.
   - If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but since there's no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, this doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post refers primarily to current feelings and possibly future intentions (e.g., ""i'm ready to get this over with soon""), but it does not describe past events or attempts. There are no specifics about historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness, which align with the 'Indicator' category. There is no explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or any plans, so it does not qualify as 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'. When in doubt, the rules specify choosing 'Indicator' over 'Ideation', which applies here due to the lack of explicit suicidal content.

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of overdosing on 500mg of Zoloft, which is a form of self-harm. Emotional indicators include regret, suffering, a desire for the suffering to end, and feelings of being a nuisance to society, indicating hopelessness and despair. There are no references to specific future plans or preparations beyond the action already taken, and no mentions of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned through the description of overdosing, which implies a suicidal action. There are direct expressions of not wanting to die but wanting suffering to end, which indirectly relates to suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as overdosing on Zoloft, and this appears to be an action already taken rather than just a plan. There are no signs of additional preparations like acquiring means for future use, so this is not just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a very recent event (""I have overdosed""), indicating a concrete action that has just happened, rather than past events or future intentions. It's focused on the immediate aftermath.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action of overdosing, which qualifies as a past attempt at suicide. According to the definitions, this fits ""Attempt"" because it involves a historic action (the overdose) that has occurred, even if recent. It does not fit ""Indicator"" due to explicit self-harm, ""Ideation"" due to the actual action taken, or ""Behavior"" as it's beyond planning and into execution.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include phrases like ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""I'm going to,"" ""I'm ready to go,"" and expressions of feeling at peace after spending time with a favorite person. These suggest an implied reference to ending one's life, with emotional indicators of resignation and readiness. There are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm, no specific plans or methods (e.g., tools, locations), and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, though phrases like ""I'm doing it"" and ""ready to go"" imply a desire to end life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, indirectly through the context of future action and readiness. Since it's not fully explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the overall tone suggests suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, locations, or preparations (e.g., no mention of acquiring means). There are signs of emotional readiness, but nothing concrete like a suicide note. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' since no explicit plan is detailed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""in the near future"" and ""I'm ready""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses a desire to end life without specifying any plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts (implied through language) but lacks details on how to act. It is not 'Indicator' due to the clear implication of wanting to die, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as it's not about past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of being ""suicidal"" in the past, frustration with high school counselors, and ongoing annoyance about an event from four years ago. There are no mentions of death, dying, self-harm, or specific plans/methods. Emotional indicators show dissatisfaction and irritation, but not current hopelessness or despair. No references to past attempts are described beyond the vague statement of being suicidal.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""i was suicidal,"" but it refers to the past. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, as it's not a current desire. Since the mention is historical and not indicative of current thoughts, and the guidelines advise leaning toward 'indicator' if unclear, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so if uncertain, 'ideation' would be chosen over 'behavior', but this doesn't even reach that level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers entirely to past events (four years ago when the user was identified as suicidal). There are no references to current or future intentions, and no specific description of a past attempt, only a past state of being suicidal.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post mentions suicide explicitly but in a historical context without describing a concrete action (as required for 'Attempt'), current desires (as for 'Ideation'), or any plans (as for 'Behavior'). Given the rules to lean toward 'Indicator' when in doubt and that the mention is not current or detailed, 'Indicator' fits best.

There are emotional indicators of despair, isolation, and anger. The post also references preparations for suicide with ""I have prepared everything"" and a recent decision to kill oneself.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: Yes, ""i should die"" and ""I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, self-hatred, and resentment.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools or locations) are mentioned, but ""I have prepared everything"" indicates some form of preparation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""i should die"" and ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""i should die"" and the overall desire to end life for the family's sake).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have prepared everything"" suggests preparations have been taken, even if not elaborated.
   - Since there are indications of preparation, this leans toward 'behavior,' but it's not fully explicit; however, the rules prioritize 'behavior' if planning is implied.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and recent intentions (e.g., ""I had made up my mind a few days"" and ongoing thoughts), not past events. No description of a completed past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), which rules out 'indicator.'
   - It includes signs of preparation (""I have prepared everything""), which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning or preparations, even if vague.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include feelings of hopelessness about the future, specifically when the user anticipates being asked to leave by roommates. There are mentions of wanting to ""vanish without a trace,"" which implies death, and references to ending up in a secluded spot where no one will find the body. Emotional indicators include despair and a sense of having nothing to look forward to. Specific plans or methods are mentioned, such as emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, walking with cash and shoes, and having a pistol, a canteen, and clothes on at the end. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, indirectly through phrases like ""vanish without a trace"" and ""keep walking until I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body,"" which strongly imply a desire to end one's life. Since it's not very explicit, I would lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the context suggests more than vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as using a pistol and going to a secluded spot. Signs of preparation include emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, and planning to have only a pistol, canteen, and clothes. This indicates explicit planning, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""when that happens I will...""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (pistol, secluded spot, preparations like emptying accounts), which fits the 'Behavior' category as it involves both thoughts and explicit planning. It's not just ideation because methods and preparations are detailed, and it's not an attempt since it's about future actions.

I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide (""I've been suicidal for about 10 years,"" ""when I do do it""), death (""I don't want the existence I've got""), and self-harm (""I would scratch and punch myself in the face""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as feeling disconnected, pushing people away, and believing no one cares. There are specific plans mentioned, like deciding on a woodland location for the act and preparing notes to warn others. References to past self-harm as a child are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I've been suicidal"" and ""when I do do it"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I don't want the existence I've got"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, indirectly, with references to not getting a rope but deciding on a location (woodland) and preparations (leaving notes on paths to warn dog walkers and call the police). This indicates planning and preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, such as choosing a location and planning warnings.
   - If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clear there is a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., childhood self-harm) and current/future intentions (e.g., recent decisions about the woodland and notes). Past self-harm is described as a concrete action, and current plans are also mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific plan (location and preparations), and references to past self-harm, which qualifies as past attempts. According to the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Attempt' fits best.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore . I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include frustration and anger towards the user's mother regarding driving privileges, feelings of being restricted and discouraged, and expressions of hatred towards life and the mother. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore,"" which indicate suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion, as seen in phrases like ""I hate my life"" and ""I'm so sick and tired."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die. These are clear indicators of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no explicit plan is present, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current frustrations and feelings, with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns best with 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing how to act on them. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

No one in my life cares. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to help me stay alive. No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of being suicidal, feelings of hopelessness, desperation, and isolation. There are references to suicide (e.g., ""to be suicidal""), emotional indicators like feeling hopeless and that no one will miss them, and a vague statement about ""tonight's the night."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""to be suicidal""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, though ""tonight's the night"" implies a possible intention, it lacks details like tools or locations. Since it's uncertain and not explicit, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""tonight's the night""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to not be alive, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation' as defined, rather than 'Indicator' (no explicit mention) or 'Behavior' (requires explicit planning).

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""oxy"" (likely oxycodone, a substance), ""cutting an artery"" (a method of self-harm that could lead to death), and a question about whether taking oxy would reduce pain during that act. There are indicators of emotional distress, such as the user expressing uncertainty and saying they don't know who else to ask, which suggests isolation. This post implies self-harm and potential suicide through the described method, but it doesn't explicitly reference past attempts or detailed preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the user doesn't directly say words like ""suicide"" or ""I want to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, it's framed as a question about a method. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I should lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the context of the method suggests more than general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies ""oxy and cutting an artery,"" which describes a substance and a physical action as a potential means. Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, as there's no mention of acquiring items or writing notes, but the discussion of combining methods indicates a plan. Since specific ideas of how to commit suicide are mentioned, this aligns with 'behavior' per the definitions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is asking a hypothetical question about the effectiveness of the method, rather than describing past events. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts through the description of a specific method (oxy and cutting an artery), which goes beyond mere ideation. According to the definitions, when specific methods or means are mentioned, it fits 'behavior.' There's no indication of a past attempt, so 'attempt' doesn't apply. It's not just general distress, so 'indicator' is not the best fit, and it exceeds 'ideation' due to the specified plan.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's friend expressing concern that the user might commit suicide, the user's feelings of hurt and upset about those comments, references to the user's mental illnesses (BPD and CPTSD), and a request for advice on how to handle the situation. There are mentions of suicide through the friend's words (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself"" as predicted by the friend), but not from the user directly. Emotional indicators include distress, hurt, and a sense of being undervalued, with expressions of general dissatisfaction and hopelessness about the user's life and relationships. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned by the user, and no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only through the friend's statements, not the user's own expressions. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive from the user? No, the user discusses the friend's comments and their emotional impact, but does not express personal suicidal thoughts. Since the focus is on the person writing the post, and the user is not explicitly mentioning their own suicide, this leans toward no direct expression from the user.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. The post does not indicate any planning or behavior related to suicide from the user.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (the friend's comments from a couple of weeks ago) and current feelings of distress, but there are no references to past attempts or current/future intentions of suicide from the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and sadness related to mental health and the friend's hurtful comments, but there is no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or plans from the user. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there is no direct mention of the user's own suicide risk. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses desperation and a plea for help. It mentions being at the window with scissors, intending to cut the screen and jump out. There are indicators of emotional distress, such as feeling overwhelmed and uncertainty about what to do. It includes references to self-harm (scissors) and potential death (jumping out the window). No mentions of past attempts.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Implicitly, jumping out the window suggests intent to die, and scissors could be for self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: Despair, urgency, and helplessness are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, the post describes being at the window with scissors to cut the screen and jump, which indicates a specific method and immediate preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of intent to engage in a fatal action (jumping out the window).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the description of preparing to jump.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is not unclear, as the intent is evident.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, scissors (tool) and jumping out the window (method and location).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the person is already at the window with scissors, indicating active preparation.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': This is explicit, so 'behavior' applies.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to the current moment (""right now"") and immediate future intentions (""about to cut the screen and jump out"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress by including explicit suicidal expressions and a specific plan with methods and preparations. This fits 'behavior' as it involves explicit thoughts plus a plan (e.g., tools and location). It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to the clear intent, 'ideation' because of the specific plan, or 'attempt' since it's not describing a past event.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""overdose on iron pills,"" which is a specific method of self-harm potentially leading to death. It also includes emotional indicators like ""i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it,"" showing hopelessness and despair. There are no references to past attempts.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness is evident through expressions of ongoing pain and unwillingness to continue dealing with it.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Overdose on iron pills"" specifies a method (substance: iron pills) and implies preparation or intent.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: While ""suicide"" isn't explicitly stated, ""overdose"" suggests self-harm with intent to die.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""i don't wanna deal with it"" imply a desire to end the pain and life.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Although not fully explicit, the context is clear enough to indicate suicidal intent beyond general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose on iron pills"" specifies a substance and method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""i'm gonna overdose"" suggests intent and possible preparation, though not detailed.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Here, a specific method is mentioned, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to future intentions (""i'm gonna overdose"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, there are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire not to deal with pain) and a specific plan (overdose on iron pills). This aligns with the 'Behavior' category, as it involves both suicidal thoughts and explicit planning of a method. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to the presence of a plan, 'Ideation' because of the specific method, or 'Attempt' since it's not about past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes multiple mentions of death and dying, such as ""I hate being alive,"" ""end my life,"" ""I want to die,"" ""to just end it all,"" and references to hoping to be murdered or for assisted suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feeling useless, alone, crying, and a sense of a vicious cycle. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, nor references to past attempts. The content expresses a strong desire for death but relies on external means like being murdered.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end it all,"" and ""assisted suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I want to die"" and ""hoping to be murdered.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plans. The post mentions walking through sketchy areas hoping to be murdered, but this is not a self-initiated plan or preparation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die (e.g., ""I want to die""), which fits the definition of Ideation. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as Behavior. No past attempts are described, ruling out Attempt. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not Indicator.

There are mentions of death and dying, but no references to self-harm, suicide specifically, or past attempts. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and exhaustion with life. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"" and ""I think I'm going to leave"" indicate a desire to die. Since the mentions are not explicitly the word ""suicide"" but do express a desire to die, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, this qualifies as explicit suicidal thoughts based on the desire to not be alive.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as persistent sadness, anxiety, depression, feelings of being a burden, self-blame, and frustration with ineffective treatments (e.g., antidepressants and anxiety meds). The user mentions an emotionally abusive mother, two-faced people, and reliance on inebriation for happiness. Phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" and ""im starting to want to wave the white flag"" suggest a desire to end their suffering. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion from coping efforts. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here"" and ""I don't think I can do it anymore"" imply a desire not to continue living, though not in explicit terms like ""I want to die."" Since this leans toward expressions of suicidal thoughts, it qualifies as more than just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; here, there is no indication of planning, so it does not reach 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to current and ongoing feelings of distress, with mentions of past experiences (e.g., trying medications, abuse), but it does not describe past suicide attempts. The focus is on present intentions rather than historical events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts through phrases indicating a desire not to be alive (e.g., ""I just don't wanna be here""), which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves desires to end one's life without any specific plan. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction (which would be 'Indicator') because of these direct expressions, but lacks any planning or methods, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'. When in doubt, the rules emphasize choosing 'Indicator' over 'Ideation' for explicit mentions, but here the expressions are sufficient for 'Ideation'.

78,"I really, really wish lives were donate-able. Today, I met a guy on the internet of the same age as me. I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago, he lost his mother to cancer, got bullied, got kicked out of school because of a false accusation which stated that he was planning a rebellion and how they were making a very small amount of money. The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of suicide (e.g., ""he was suicidal like me""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" and the wish to donate one's life), and a general expression of not wanting to live. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts by the user are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user states ""he was suicidal like me,"" implying their own suicidal state.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and the desire to ""donate my life.""
   - Since these are explicit, I do not lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any preparations like notes or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no evidence of a plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or ongoing feelings (e.g., ""I don't deserve, nor want to live""), rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts by the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire not to live), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and dying (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster,"" ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair (""I'm tired of it,"" ""it's a fucking joke,"" ""Family is a fucking joke""). There are signs of preparation, such as stopping all medications (""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds"") and quitting therapy, which could indirectly relate to self-harm. No references to past attempts or explicit self-harm methods.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon"" directly express a desire to die.
   - Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned but there are clear expressions of wanting to die, this leans toward ideation, as the definitions prioritize explicit desires over requiring the exact word ""suicide.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly; while stopping meds and relying on unhealthy habits (e.g., ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"") could imply indirect methods, they do not detail tools, locations, or substances in a clear suicidal plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, stopping medications today could be seen as preparation, but it is not a fully explicit plan like acquiring a weapon or writing a note.
   - Since this is uncertain as a full plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current intentions (e.g., stopping meds today) and future hopes (e.g., ""Hope it all ends soon""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of wanting to die, fitting Ideation, as there are no detailed plans or methods mentioned. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) but does not meet the threshold for Behavior due to lack of explicit planning. Thus, Ideation is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to disappear and references to a ""broken remainings of my soul"" to be free from pain. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as feelings of pain and a desire for freedom from it. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as ""want to disappear"" is vague and not a direct expression of suicidal intent. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but based on the lack of any explicit elements, this doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings or desires, with no indication of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of suicide (""Why shouldn't I kill myself?"" and ""Ps: I just need a plan for suicide""). Emotional indicators show despair and hopelessness. There are no mentions of specific methods, preparations, or past attempts; it only expresses a need for a plan without detailing any.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""Why shouldn't I kill myself?"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No, only a general statement about needing a plan, which does not constitute a specific method or preparation. Since it's not explicit, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (needing a plan), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts but lacks any specific plan or preparations, fitting the definition of 'ideation'. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'behavior' without a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of uncontrollably saying ""I'm going to kill myself,"" references to a ""failed attempt"" (likely a past suicide attempt), phrases like ""I wish I stayed in the car"" related to that attempt, ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly,"" and a gesture of putting a finger gun in the mouth to simulate blowing brains out. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""kill myself""), emotional indicators of distress and seeking relatability, and references to a past attempt. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (implied in the phrases and gestures). This is clear and not vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, or substances. The finger gun gesture is a simulation, not a plan. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior, but the past attempt reference changes the category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings (e.g., saying suicidal phrases uncontrollably) and a past event (e.g., ""my most recent failed attempt""). The failed attempt is specifically described as historical.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself""), which could suggest ideation. However, it explicitly describes a past failed attempt, which fits the 'Attempt' category. According to the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts, even with current mentions, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me.

   - Key elements in this post include expressions of self-hatred regarding appearance, descriptions of mistreatment by others, feelings of anger, hopelessness, and explicit statements about not wanting to live.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore.""
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward carrying out a suicide.
   - Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post primarily refers to current feelings of distress and past experiences of abuse and bullying, with the suicidal thoughts appearing to be current rather than historical. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to not live anymore and being suicidal), which rules out 'indicator.' However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.' It also does not describe any past attempts, ruling out 'attempt.' Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation,' as it involves explicit suicidal desires without a concrete plan.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as seen in phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" and the urge to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger,"" which imply the use of a gun.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy.

My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is directly used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing"" and ""I need to leave,"" indicating a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""I'm starting to think,"" rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method for suicide. This aligns with the definition of Ideation, as there are no elements of planning or past actions.

No one is going to convince me otherwise. But yeah I practiced and there was no pain really. I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed. The thought makes me so happy. Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy. I take great solace knowing that this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon. I'm saying this on reddit because if I were to share this with people in real life they'd try to stop me and I don't want anyone to take this away from me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include explicit mentions of practicing hanging as a method of suicide, expressions of worthlessness, hopelessness, and a strong desire to die. There are emotional indicators like despair (""My life is fucked now""), hopelessness (""There's no turning it around""), and excitement about death (""The thought makes me so happy""). Specific plans and methods are mentioned, such as practicing hanging to overcome survival instincts. There are no clear references to past full attempts, but the practicing could imply preparatory actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly talks about hanging themselves and wanting to succeed in it.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, phrases like ""I deserve to die,"" ""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" and ""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy"" show a clear desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging is specified as the method, and they've been practicing it.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user describes ongoing practice to build tolerance and overcome instincts, which qualifies as preparation.
   - Since there is clear evidence of a plan and preparation, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past and current actions (e.g., ""I've been practicing"") and future intentions (e.g., ""I will succeed"" and ""this pain will be over soon""). There are no descriptions of a completed past attempt, only preparatory behaviors.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts along with specific plans and preparations (practicing hanging), which aligns with the ""Behavior"" category. It is not just general distress (""Indicator""), nor is it limited to thoughts without a plan (""Ideation""). There is no evidence of a completed past attempt, so ""Attempt"" does not apply primarily, even though preparations are mentioned.

92,"Snapped at my dog. I know i'm a piece of shit. My dog is 14. She always barks and growls at me if i walk by when someone else is eating. My family always says its because she sees me as 'weak' because i was scared of dogs when we first got her. That makes me feel like absolute shit and its all i can think of every time this happens. Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her. I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this. I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them, to a clueless little dog. I want to die. I want to disappear. I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of anger and self-loathing (e.g., ""I know I'm a piece of shit,"" feeling like absolute shit), mentions of harming or threatening to harm the dog (e.g., screaming ""I would kill her"" and whipping a blanket), and direct statements about wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I am on the edge and if not tonight one day I will take myself away""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as fear of hurting others and self-hatred. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I will take myself away.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""I want to die"" and ""I want to disappear.""
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""if not tonight one day I will take myself away""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the direct mentions of wanting to die, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I have everything. I have loving family, amazing and cute dog. I don't have any reason to feel like this. Everything started with second lockdown  in my country in october. I couldn't see my friends for a long time. Studying through MS Teams was draining me. I had some anxiety attacks aswell. I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of feeling like trash, not wanting to exist, general hopelessness, lack of purpose, anxiety attacks from past events like lockdown and online studying, and dissatisfaction with life despite having a loving family and a dog. There are emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm beyond the phrase ""I just don't want to exist."" No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in denial (""I'm not suicidal or something""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with ""I just don't want to exist,"" but this is immediately contrasted with a denial of suicidality and a statement that suicide is selfish. Given the rules, when in doubt about explicit mentions, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no indications of planning, this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., lockdown in October, anxiety attacks) and current feelings of distress, but there are no references to past attempts or current/future intentions involving suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and a vague desire not to exist, but explicitly denies suicidality. According to the definitions, this lacks explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts because of the denial and absence of any plan or confirmation. Therefore, it best fits 'Indicator', as general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicide mentions fall under this category.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I don't know what I truly want besides death,"" ""I want to take my life,"" and explicit reference to a past attempt: ""I attempted suicide last week."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness, e.g., ""I don't think life has any inherent purpose,"" and feelings of being controlled or exploited. There are no specific plans or methods described for future actions, but the past attempt is noted without details on preparations. References to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I attempted suicide last week"" and ""I want to take my life.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I don't know what I truly want besides death.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, or substances. The past attempt is mentioned but not elaborated upon.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Indirectly, through the reference to drafting a suicide note for the past attempt, but no current preparations are indicated. Since this is not explicit for current actions, it leans toward ideation for any ongoing thoughts, but the past attempt is key.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""I attempted suicide last week"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to take my life""). The past attempt is specifically described as having occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt, which fits the 'Attempt' category. It also includes current suicidal thoughts, but the presence of a described past attempt overrides and qualifies it as 'Attempt' per the definition, especially since it combines past actions with ongoing expressions.

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include a question about the lethal dose of Valium, a statement indicating the person has already taken some but fears it's insufficient, and an expression of wanting to end a ""nightmare."" This involves mentions of death (killing via Valium), emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness, and a specific method (Valium). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to a lethal dose of Valium and the implication of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""I just want this nightmare to end"" combined with the Valium inquiry.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, Valium is specified as a substance for potentially causing death.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the statement ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" suggests the person has already ingested Valium, indicating action or preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clear there's a method and implied action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current intentions or actions, as the language is present tense (e.g., ""I haven't taken enough""), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post goes beyond general distress by explicitly mentioning a method (Valium) and indicating preparation or action taken, which aligns with 'Behavior'. It includes suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan, fitting the definition for 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan) or 'Indicator' (no explicit suicide mention).

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of death, dying, and suicide, such as the user's statements about past suicide attempts (e.g., taking pills, using a razor, and overdosing on prescriptions). Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, like ""I don't want to live at all"" and the user's fear of surviving accidents. Specific methods and preparations are described for past events, including buying pills, writing a suicide note, and using a razor. References to past attempts are detailed, including one at age 16 and others in 2020.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the user directly refers to ""suicide attempts."" There are also direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (Yes), such as ""I don't want to live at all.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned for past events (e.g., pills, razor, prescriptions), along with signs of preparation (e.g., buying pills, writing a note). However, these are not current plans; they describe historical actions. Since no current or future plans are indicated, this leans toward past behavior rather than active planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events, including specific suicide attempts at age 16 and in 2020, as well as a recent non-suicide-related accident. There are no clear indications of current or future intentions, though the user's general despair could imply ongoing thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts with concrete actions (e.g., swallowing pills, self-harm with a razor), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. While there are expressions of not wanting to live, these do not involve current plans, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior.' It is not 'Ideation' because of the detailed past attempts, and it is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide (""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself,"" ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it""), self-harm (""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., failing liver due to alcoholism, marriage ending, business failing, extreme stress). There are references to a specific method (belt around the neck) and an action taken, as well as preparations implied in the described incident.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., using a belt around the neck in the closet, which implies a hanging method).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (the user describes actually putting the belt on and positioning themselves, indicating preparation and action taken).
   - Since this involves explicit action, it goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both a recent past event (the incident with the belt tonight, which is a described attempt) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I'm so close to just doing it,"" seeking reasons not to proceed). The post explicitly describes a past action that aligns with a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, a specific method, and a described past action (putting the belt around the neck and nearly passing out), which constitutes a suicide attempt. According to the definitions, this fits 'Attempt' because it describes a concrete past action. Additionally, the rule specifies that if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" which directly relate to suicide. Emotional indicators include ""scared,"" ""too tired of life,"" and references to the illegality of suicide, suggesting despair and hopelessness. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as indicated by ""too tired of life"" and the fear of attempting suicide.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is mentioned.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

   - This refers to current feelings and hypothetical future consequences (e.g., getting arrested if failing), but not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to end life via ""kill myself"" and tiredness of life) but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'Ideation.'

So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme anger, frustration, and hopelessness about life, society, government, and the meaninglessness of existence. It mentions themes like being slaves to the system, working for minimal rewards, and the pointlessness of life. Specific elements include: ""We start dying the second we are born,"" which is a general statement about life's futility; and ""This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good,"" which implies an intention to end one's life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, or preparations for self-harm, nor references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are indirect expressions like ""to end this bullshit for good,"" which strongly implies a desire to end one's life. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""This isn't fucking living"" and the plan to end it, indicating a desire to not continue living.
   - Since it's not very explicit (no direct use of words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""), but the context leans toward suicidal intent, I must lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the overall tone and statements suggest more than vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, substances, or exact methods (e.g., no mention of weapons, pills, or locations beyond a vague ""trip"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a hint with ""This will be my second to last post,"" suggesting some form of farewell, and ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this,"" which implies a future plan, but it's not detailed or confirmed as preparation for suicide.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Here, the plan is vague and not specific, so I am uncertain and will opt for 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., the trip in April), not past events. There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) but lacks specific plans or methods, fitting 'ideation'. It's not just general distress ('indicator'), as there's a clear implication of wanting to die. It's not 'behavior' due to the absence of detailed planning, and not 'attempt' since no past actions are described. Given the rules, when unsure about explicit plans, 'ideation' is the appropriate choice.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of active preparations like acquiring means or writing a note; it's expressed as wishes rather than concrete actions.
   - Based on the definitions, the mention of specific methods (ways/means) aligns with considering this as more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, as the language is in the present tense (e.g., ""i just wish""), with no description of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions specific methods (e.g., getting hit by a car or overdosing), which, per the definitions, categorizes it as 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.' There are no past attempts, so it's not 'attempt,' and it's beyond general distress, so not 'indicator.'

101,"If your attractive and you complain about how depressed you are, go fuck yourself. Call this gatekeeping depression I don't care, but if you're depressed as an attractive person go fuck yourself. You can't begin to imagine the daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body. Being unwanted in literally all facets of life from growing up to adulthood. If youre attractive the world is literally your oyster, I would never stop smiling I was born that way. I would fucking jump out of bed every morning because at least I have that because appearance, which is totally determined by chance, is the thing that has by far the biggest difference in ones life. I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and envy towards attractive people who complain about depression, contrasted with the user's own experiences of being ""ugly"" and facing daily torture, being unwanted in life, and a strong desire to have been born attractive. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life due to appearance, as seen in phrases like ""daily torture"" and ""I would give absolutely everything I own."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general dissatisfaction and envy but does not directly state a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear and the rules instruct to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' in such cases, I will classify accordingly.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to any plans, tools, or methods related to suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current feelings and hypothetical preferences (e.g., wishing to have been born attractive), but it does not describe past events, future intentions, or any attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness about life due to appearance, but there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit suicidal expressions. Even with significant dissatisfaction, the absence of direct suicide references means it does not qualify as 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

102,'Just a phase'. Was told that me being suicidal is 'just a phase' because of my age despite me being abused and severely mentally ill. I've tried to kill myself 8 times. I'm tired of people's ignorance,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user being told their suicidal state is ""just a phase"" due to age, despite experiences of abuse and severe mental illness. There are explicit mentions of suicide attempts (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"") and emotional indicators like frustration, tiredness, and ignorance from others, suggesting hopelessness and despair.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, specifically ""tried to kill myself 8 times,"" which directly references suicide attempts.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through descriptions of being abused, mentally ill, and frustrated with dismissal.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned; the post focuses on past events.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, the user states they have attempted suicide eight times.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""me being suicidal"" and ""tried to kill myself 8 times.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the suicidal state and past attempts, though not as a current desire.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is clear, so no need to lean.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no details on methods, tools, or preparations are provided.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no planning is mentioned, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It primarily refers to past events (past attempts) and current feelings of being suicidal, but no future intentions are indicated.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user explicitly states ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. It focuses on historic actions rather than current plans or ideation alone. Although there are elements of current distress, the explicit reference to past attempts makes 'Attempt' the best fit, as per the definition that prioritizes historic actions.

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a contrast between common advice about removing sad influences and the user's statement ""i'm better off dead."" There are mentions of death through the phrase ""better off dead,"" which implies a desire to not be alive. Emotional indicators include sarcasm or irony, as suggested by the "":D"" emoji, potentially indicating distress or hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""i'm better off dead"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive. Since this is a clear expression of wanting to die, it qualifies as an explicit indicator of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or any plans, so this does not indicate behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or general feelings rather than past events. It's about the user's present statement and reactions to it, with no reference to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit expression of wanting to die (""i'm better off dead""), which fits the definition of Ideation as it involves suicidal thoughts without any specific plan. There is no mention of plans or past attempts, so it's not Behavior or Attempt. It's not Indicator because the desire to not be alive is explicitly stated, making it more than just general dissatisfaction.

104,overdose help please. sorry if this is the wrong subreddit or an inappropriate post but i dont know where else to post/ask this. i took 44 paracetamol almost an ho ur ago and i dont think i want to die but something is stopping me cllng 999. my stomach is hurting very badly. i didnt eat most of today if that cha ges anything. sweating badly and shakingtoo. could i survive an od like this or do i need to call emergency services? i feel like a burden. i did this to myself after all,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a description of taking 44 paracetamol (an overdose), physical symptoms like stomach pain, sweating, and shaking, and emotional indicators such as feeling like a burden and regret for the action. There are mentions of self-harm through the overdose, but no explicit references to past attempts beyond this incident. Emotional indicators show distress and hopelessness, as the user expresses not wanting to die but having taken the action anyway.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" isn't used, but the act of overdosing is described. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, the user states ""i dont think i want to die,"" but they acknowledge the action. Since it's not explicitly about wanting to die, this leans toward caution, but the context of the overdose overrides vague denials.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned: taking 44 paracetamol, which is a clear method of overdose. There are signs of preparation, as the action has already been taken. However, this is not just ideation; it's a completed act, so it goes beyond planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a very recent event (""almost an hour ago""), which is a past action with current consequences. No other past attempts are described; it's focused on this immediate incident.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action that has already happened—an overdose—which fits the definition of ""Attempt"" as it involves a historic action. Although the user expresses uncertainty about wanting to die, the fact that the attempt occurred makes this the best category. If it were just thoughts without action, it might be ""Ideation,"" but the overdose qualifies as a past attempt.

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to end one's life, as indicated by the repeated phrase ""I want to end it."" This suggests a desire related to death or dying, implying emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts. The post explicitly states a lack of ideas on how or when to act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, there are direct expressions of wanting to die, as ""I want to end it"" clearly conveys a desire to not be alive anymore. Since this is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts, it leans toward ideation rather than being unclear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" indicating no plans, methods, or signs of preparation. Given the absence of any planning details, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current intentions, as it uses present tense (""I want to end it"") and expresses ongoing thoughts without referencing past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of Ideation, which involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general distress (as in Indicator) because it directly expresses a wish to end life, but lacks any mention of methods or preparations, so it is not Behavior or Attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional exhaustion, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, such as being ""sick and tired"" of a cycle of highs and lows, feeling like a robot, and not enjoying life. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair, hopelessness, and a sense of being overlooked or unstable, but there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there is general distress and statements like ""I really can't handle it anymore"" and ""it feels completely hopeless,"" these do not explicitly indicate a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear and the instructions lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' in such cases, I will classify accordingly.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not factor into a higher category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers primarily to current feelings and a recurring situation from the past year, but it does not describe past attempts or future intentions explicitly.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or a plan. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's recent diagnosis of bipolar disorder, their initial difficulty in accepting it, ongoing therapy, feelings of loneliness and loss, comparisons to a relative, past experiences of mental breakdowns, and a current sense of improvement and positivity. There are mentions of emotional distress like feeling lonely and lost, and a reference to ""rock bottom"" involving past depression, bipolar mental breakdowns, almost being abusive, and physical symptoms like puking. The phrase ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death"" mentions death metaphorically as the lowest point in life, but not in the context of personal suicide or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, and there are no references to past suicide attempts—only past mental health struggles.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the mention of ""death"" is vague and general, not a personal desire. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so no need to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events (e.g., rock bottom experiences from years ago) and current improvements, with no references to current or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and past hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. This fits the 'Indicator' category, as it involves vague references to death without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt about explicit mentions, 'Indicator' is chosen.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""plan on ending it soon,"" indicating suicidal intent. There are emotional indicators like feeling overwhelmed by guilt, wishing to apologize to family and girlfriend, and fear of pain. It specifically references a method: ""overdosing on ibuprofen.""

   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and guilt are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, mentions overdosing on ibuprofen as a plan, and timing like ""tonight or this week.""
   - References to past attempts: None.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""ending it"" and referencing overdose.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the user expresses a plan to end their life.
   - It's clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, overdosing on ibuprofen is specified as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly detailed, but the method and timing suggest intent.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current and future intentions, such as ""soon,"" ""tonight or this week.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (overdosing on ibuprofen), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves mentioning a method. It's not just ideation since a plan is detailed, and it's not an attempt as no past action is described.

I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses a relapse into an addiction to extreme pornography, feelings of regret and low self-worth, and a hypothetical statement about suicide (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself""). It includes emotional indicators like hopelessness, self-loathing, and a belief in being ""fucked up"" as a metric for others. There are mentions of death and suicide, but no specific plans, methods beyond a hypothetical gun, or references to past suicide attempts. The user expresses distress and predicts future worsening of their condition.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I'd kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the user states they would kill themselves if they had a gun.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a gun is mentioned as a hypothetical method (""If I had a gun"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of acquiring a gun, writing a note, or any concrete steps; it's conditional and not an active plan.
   - Since this is hypothetical and not a confirmed plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past addiction and a recent relapse, but the suicide mention is about current feelings and a potential future action. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die if they had a gun), but lacks any specific, concrete plan or preparations. This fits 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal desires without detailing methods in a planning context. It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' due to the lack of concrete planning, and not 'Attempt' as no past attempts are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""I just wanna kill myself,"" which directly reference suicide and a desire to die. Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, and frustration about the user's living situation with their parents' smoking, including fears of lung cancer for themselves and their brother. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools or locations. There are also no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""I just wanna kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user expresses a desire to end their life before facing health consequences.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, locations, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as Behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and ongoing thoughts, with no indication of past events or attempts. It focuses on present distress and future fears.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" and a plan that the user believes will work. It also includes emotional indicators like ""worthless existence,"" ""past years have shit,"" and excitement to ""move on,"" showing hopelessness and despair. There are references to a specific plan and timeline (""next week""), but no explicit methods (e.g., tools or substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""move on from this worthless existence"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post refers to ""a plan on how i can kill myself"" and states it's been thought over and will work, implying a method exists, though not explicitly detailed (e.g., no mention of specific tools or locations). There are signs of preparation through the confirmation of the plan and the set timeline. Since this mentions a plan, even if not fully detailed, it leans toward explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I plan on doing it next week""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die) and mentions a plan (""suicide plan"" and ""how i can kill myself"" with a timeline), which aligns with 'Behavior'. It goes beyond just ideation by indicating explicit planning, even if the method isn't specified in detail.

I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of a history of depression and suicidal thoughts, a past suicide attempt (many years ago), current suicidal thoughts due to recent stressors like chronic medical issues and pain, and emotional indicators such as hopelessness, feeling bad about seeking help, and distress in relationships. There are no mentions of death, dying, or self-harm beyond the past attempt, no specific plans or methods for suicide, and no signs of preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post refers to ""suicidal thoughts"" and a past ""attempted suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the mention of current suicidal thoughts resurfacing.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no details about plans or methods, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (a suicide attempt many years ago) and current intentions (resurfacing suicidal thoughts), but there are no indications of future plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt, which aligns with the ""Attempt"" category, as it focuses on historic actions. Although current suicidal thoughts are mentioned, there are no specific plans, so it doesn't fit ""Behavior"" or ""Ideation"" as the primary element. The definitions prioritize past attempts for this category, making ""Attempt"" the best fit.

There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like not being able to cope and things ""getting to be too much.""

No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses thoughts of self-harm and coping mechanisms, but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear if this constitutes explicit suicidal content, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? There is a mention of ""cutting"" as a coping method, which relates to self-harm, but it is not presented as a plan for suicide. No signs of preparation for suicide (e.g., tools, locations, or notes) are indicated. If uncertain about explicit planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's no evidence of any plan, so it doesn't reach that level.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and thoughts of self-harm, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit expressions concerning suicide, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'. It does not qualify as 'Ideation' due to the absence of suicidal thoughts, nor 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there's no plan or past action described.

114,"Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over. If you really loved me, you'd want me to be happy. The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""when I die,"" ""if I'm dead""), emotional indicators of pain, hopelessness, and despair (e.g., ""my pain is finally over,"" ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead""). There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post directly expresses a desire to die as the only path to happiness. Since this is a clear expression of wanting to die, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this would not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (e.g., ""when I die""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This best fits the 'Ideation' category, as it involves suicidal feelings without planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. It also includes ""take the leap,"" which could imply a method like jumping from a height. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""I don't care about anything anymore,"" ""I don't want to live,"" ""my life is all downhill,"" ""career dreams are ruined,"" ""I'll never have kids,"" and ""I have nothing in my life."" There are no explicit mentions of self-harm beyond suicide, no specific preparations like acquiring tools, and no references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I don't want to live"" and ""goodbye.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""take the leap"" suggests a method, likely jumping, which aligns with a suicide plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the decision phrasing implies intent to act.
   - Since a method is indicated, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I finally decided""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expressions and mentions a potential method (""take the leap""), which qualifies as explicit planning under the 'Behavior' definition. It is not just ideation since a method is referenced, and it does not describe a past attempt.

116,"Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all. Playing witcher 3 before i call it quits. Honestly, i feel so relaxed that it's finally ending. 22 years on this earth was enough for me. Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include phrases like ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" ""it's finally ending,"" and ""22 years on this earth was enough for me,"" which imply a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators show a mix of reflection on past enjoyment and current hopelessness, with a sense of finality in ""Goodbye."" There are no mentions of death, dying, or suicide explicitly by name, no specific plans or methods (e.g., no tools or locations), and no references to past attempts. The post expresses general dissatisfaction with the last year of life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) – Phrases like ""end it all"" and ""call it quits"" are indirect euphemisms but suggest suicidal intent. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? (Yes) – Statements such as ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"" indicate a desire to not be alive. Since the language is not very explicit (e.g., not directly saying ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""), but there is a clear indication of wanting to die, I lean toward 'ideation' as per the guidelines, though the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' if in doubt about explicitness.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) – No tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed. Playing a game ""one last time"" might suggest emotional preparation, but it's not explicit. If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' so this does not qualify as a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""before I end it all""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) without any specific plan, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the presence of implied suicidal desires, not 'Behavior' due to the lack of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as it involves no past actions.

She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses concern for a friend who reportedly attempted suicide three days ago and is now on restrictions. It mentions the friend's lack of response and the user's fear. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the user themselves. Emotional indicators include fear and worry about the friend, but these are not about the user's own state. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to the user's past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in reference to the friend (""she had tried to kill herself""). For the user, there are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.
   - Since the analysis must focus on the person writing the post, this mention does not apply to the user.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, and nothing is mentioned regarding the user.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, for the user.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to a past event (friend's attempt) and current concern, but none of it pertains to the user's own past, current, or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts by the user. It only discusses the friend's situation. Based on the rules, we evaluate only the user's content, which shows general distress about others but no suicide-related indicators for themselves. This fits best under 'Indicator' as there are no explicit mentions of the user's own suicide risk.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (e.g., ""I will hang myself now""), self-harm (e.g., ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness, loneliness, and despair (e.g., ""I've been alone since I was 5,"" ""nobody has ever liked me""). There are also references to a specific method (hanging) and preparations (e.g., ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it""), along with details about weight to ensure the method works.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I will hang myself now"" and ""I don't want to be alone anymore"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as hanging and looking for something to tie that will kill the person. There are signs of preparation, like actively searching for a means. This goes beyond vague thoughts, indicating a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This primarily refers to current or immediate future intentions (e.g., ""I will hang myself now"" and ""I'm now looking""), though it includes references to past events like bullying and self-harm. The focus is on present actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts along with a specific plan (hanging and seeking means), which fits the 'behavior' category. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'ideation' because of the plan, and not 'attempt' as it describes current intentions rather than past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as feeling shattered, shitty, miserable, unable to function, being ripped apart, shaking, and questioning how to live. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, but without any reference to specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the user explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" which denies such desires. Since this is clear and not unclear, it leans toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so no need to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and emotions, with no references to past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and sadness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it involves vague dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, we choose 'indicator', and here it's straightforward.

There is a direct mention of ""I just want to kill myself,"" which indicates a desire for suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""I can't handle it,"" ""Tf is this life?

You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious.

Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

Emotional indicators include despair, self-hate, and feelings of being a coward regarding suicidal thoughts. There are references to specific plans and methods for causing destruction, such as using extension ladders, isolated wire cutters, making nitroglycerin, and targeting power plants. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""I WANT TO DOIE"" and discussions of suicidal thoughts as a cope.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases implying a desire to end life dramatically.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details tools (extension ladders, wire cutters), substances (nitroglycerin), and locations (power plants) that could be used for self-harm or suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, it suggests researching and acquiring items, like learning to make nitroglycerin and visiting power plants.
   - Since specific methods and preparations are described, this goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad.

With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post describes severe bullying and harassment of the user's best friend by another woman, including verbal threats like ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself,"" physical threats, insults, and creation of fake accounts and images. Emotional indicators include the friend being mentally disturbed, constantly tired, not eating, overwhelmed, and feeling unable to stand up for herself. There are no mentions of death, dying, or suicide from the writer themselves, only from the bully directed at the friend. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only as a quote from the bully to the friend, not from the writer or as an expression of the writer's own thoughts. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, from the writer. The post expresses concern for the friend but does not include any suicidal thoughts or feelings from the person writing the post.
   - Since the mention is not from the writer and the rules specify that suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, this does not qualify as explicit for the writer.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to any suicide methods, plans, or preparations by anyone in the post.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, nothing suggests even ideation for the writer.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to ongoing events (bullying over the past 5 days) and current concerns for the friend, with no references to past, current, or future suicidal intentions from the writer.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post involves general expressions of distress about the friend's situation but lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts from the writer. According to the rules, the risk is only for the person writing the post, and here, there are no indicators of suicide risk for them—only concern for others. When in doubt, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation,' which aligns with this analysis.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions suicide explicitly with phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" and ""I want to hang myself so bad."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""I am a loser, ugly, no motivation, isolated,"" ""feel so alone,"" ""nothing to look forward to,"" and ""small piece of hope left.""

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself"" and ""I want to hang myself so bad.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions, as in ""suicide is on my mind everyday"" and ""I want to hang myself so bad."" No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""hang myself""), which fits the 'behavior' category, as it mentions a plan even briefly. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'ideation' because of the specific method, or 'attempt' since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions being ""still alive unfortunately,"" references a recent suicide attempt (""last night I attempted once again""), notes this as the 15th time, expresses ongoing desire to attempt again, mentions finding a reason to live, and discusses barriers to seeking help like lack of health insurance and COVID risk.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicit mentions of suicide attempts (past and potential future).
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident in phrases like ""still alive unfortunately"" and ""still want to attempt again.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is detailed, it doesn't qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past events (last night's attempt and previous ones) and current intentions (wanting to attempt again), but the focus is on the historical action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, as a recent and repeated occurrence.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes past suicide attempts explicitly, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. It also mentions current suicidal thoughts, but the presence of described past actions takes precedence per the rules (e.g., if past attempts are mentioned, even with current elements, classify as 'attempt'). It doesn't qualify as 'Behavior' due to the absence of a specific plan, and it's beyond just 'Ideation' or 'Indicator' because of the explicit past attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of extreme distress, such as feeling at the end of their rope, everything crumbling, breath slowing down, chest hurting, and a desire not to wake up. There are mentions of past actions (""as I've done this before"" and ""I know this is going to be another failure""), indicating possible prior attempts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, fear, sadness, and isolation. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I hope I don't wake up"" and references to past failures.
   - Since it's not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit desires, this supports moving beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since no plan is evident, this rules out 'behavior' and suggests 'ideation' or potentially 'attempt' based on other factors.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (""as I've done this before"" and ""I know this is going to be another failure,"" implying prior attempts) and current feelings (e.g., ""I feel myself falling asleep"" and ""I hope I don't wake up""). The past attempts are a key focus, which aligns with the 'attempt' category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post does not fit 'indicator' due to expressions of wanting to die and references to past actions. It includes explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan, which could suggest 'ideation', but the mention of past attempts (""as I've done this before"") directly aligns with the 'attempt' category, as it describes historic actions rather than just thoughts. According to the definitions, when past attempts are referenced, even with current feelings, the post should be classified as 'attempt'.

   - This refers primarily to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I am going to shoot myself"" right after posting), with a brief mention of past thoughts since June, but no actual past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (loaded gun and intent to use it immediately), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, 'Ideation' because of the presence of a plan, or 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's description of a past suicidal episode where they wrote a note, ingested bleach, and vomited it out. There are mentions of death and suicide through the act of attempting to end their life with bleach. Emotional indicators include depression, stress, feeling unappreciated, and hopelessness from being a middle child. Specific plans or methods are referenced, such as writing a suicide note and swallowing bleach. There are also references to past attempts, as the event occurred a week ago.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user describes a suicidal episode and the attempt to end their life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the note and the action of swallowing bleach.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as using bleach as a substance. Signs of preparation include writing a note. Since this involves explicit planning and behavior, it goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past events, specifically an attempt that happened a week ago. There are no indications of current or future intentions; it's focused on what has already occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete past action of attempting suicide by swallowing bleach, which aligns with the definition of ""Attempt."" It involves a historical event where an actual attempt took place, not just thoughts or plans. Therefore, it fits best under ""Attempt.""

128,"The only reason I'm alive is cause my parents are still alive. Long story short, I lost my sibling this year and ever since my anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse. After the funeral I basically lost all will to live. But I tried to pull through and find things to do to occupy my time. I thought I was getting better and moving on but I realise when I stop doing everything and sit alone, I still want to die. The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child :/ please help",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the loss of a sibling, worsening anxiety and depression, loss of will to live, and a current desire to die. There are mentions of wanting to die and emotional indicators such as hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) - The word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) - Phrases like ""I basically lost all will to live"" and ""I still want to die"" indicate a desire to not be alive.
   - Since there are direct expressions of wanting to die, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) - No tools, locations, substances, or preparations are referenced.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) - Nothing indicates any steps toward acting on thoughts.
   - Since no plan is evident, this should be classified as ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events (loss of sibling and worsening mental health) but focuses on current intentions and feelings, such as the ongoing desire to die. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die) without any specific plan, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to the direct expressions of wanting to die. It is not 'Behavior' as no plan or method is mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' since no past actions are described.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of suicide (""thinking of suicide for months on end""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""deeper than I've ever been,"" ""darkest corners,"" ""my end will only get nearer,"" and being fine with outcomes that could worsen the situation), and references to using LSD as a coping mechanism. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific suicide methods, or past attempts. The post expresses ongoing suicidal thoughts tied to the user's current state.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""thinking of suicide for months on end."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through phrases like ""my end will only get nearer"" and acceptance of potentially fatal outcomes. Since it's explicit, this leans away from 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, substances for suicide) are detailed; LSD is mentioned as a potential coping tool, not a suicide plan. Are there signs of preparation? No, such as acquiring means or writing a note. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' and here, there's no clear plan, so it fits ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and ongoing thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months on end"") and potential future intentions (e.g., taking LSD and what might follow), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires (e.g., ongoing thoughts of suicide and acceptance of death), but lacks any specific plan or preparation for suicide. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing methods or actions. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user expressing emotional distress (""i hit a new low tonight,"" ""i havent felt ok in a while and im not sure what to do""), stealing their dog's hydrocodone to feel okay, and consuming alcohol. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are described. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The content expresses a desire to feel okay but does not mention suicide or a wish to end life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? The post mentions stealing hydrocodone and drinking alcohol, which could be risky behaviors, but these are not described in the context of suicide or as a plan to end life. There are no signs of preparation for suicide. Since it's uncertain if this constitutes explicit planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if needed, but it doesn't seem to reach that level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to recent events (tonight's actions) and current feelings, with no indication of future intentions or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general distress and risky behavior (substance use), but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, desires to die, or plans to commit suicide. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit suicidal expressions, and general hopelessness without such mentions defaults to this category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""I see no point in living anymore,"" ""I don't have any friends,"" and ""Nothing in my life is working out."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include general dissatisfaction and hopelessness, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" implies a vague dissatisfaction with life, but it does not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life. Since this is unclear and not very explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of any plan or method, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and intentions, with no reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'indicator,' as suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user addressing their friend Macy, expressing guilt about their problems being known, and stating that they have taken a large number of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. There are mentions of death and dying through the reference to potentially not waking up after taking pills, which implies self-harm or overdose. Emotional indicators include feelings of guilt, unfairness, and being ""fucked up."" Specific plans or methods are referenced with ""taken a fuck load of pills,"" indicating a method of overdose. There are no clear references to past attempts; this seems focused on a recent action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of taking pills and the possibility of not waking up, which directly implies an intent to end one's life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the action and its consequences suggest a desire not to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as taking a ""fuck load of pills,"" which is a substance for overdose. There are signs of preparation, as the user states they have already taken the pills, indicating an action has been carried out. Since this involves an explicit method and action, it goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a recent or current event (having taken the pills), with future implications (might not wake up tomorrow). It does not describe past attempts but focuses on something that has just happened.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action (taking pills, likely an overdose) that has already occurred, which aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' as it involves a past action with suicidal intent. Although there might be an element of current risk, the key is the description of the action that has happened, making 'Attempt' the best fit. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal indications, 'Ideation' because of the described action, or 'Behavior' as the action has already been taken rather than just planned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (e.g., ""planning out my suicide,"" ""go through with this""), references to a past attempt (e.g., ""fear of failing an attempt once again""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I'm tired of the constant struggle,"" ""I can't find a reason to continue living""), and indications of future intentions (e.g., ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st""). There are no specific methods, tools, or substances mentioned, but there is a timeline and a sense of determination.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I have no intention of anyone stopping me,"" ""I intend to do it right this time"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed. Are there signs of preparation? There is mention of ""planning out my suicide"" and a specific timeline (January 1st), but no explicit preparations like acquiring means. Since there are no specific methods or clear preparations, this leans toward ideation, but I must consider the overall context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to both past events (e.g., ""failing an attempt once again"") and current/future intentions (e.g., planning for January 1st). It explicitly describes a past attempt while also discussing ongoing plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires, but without specific methods or preparations, which might suggest ideation. However, it also references a past attempt (""failing an attempt once again"") and combines this with current plans. According to the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'.

   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: Yes, specifically ""kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness, despair, and distress are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned; it's more about vague contemplation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I do not want to live anymore"" and ""I hate being alive.""
   - The mentions are clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only vague thoughts about timing (e.g., ""do it now"" vs. later), which doesn't constitute explicit planning.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and possible future intentions (e.g., wondering about doing it now), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die, mentioning killing oneself) but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no specific planning, and not 'Attempt' as there's no description of past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of attempting suicide, self-harm through hanging, and a safety measure to prevent death. Emotional indicators are present, such as the casual reference to frequent attempts, which suggests distress or hopelessness. Specific methods are mentioned (hanging with a chair or elevated object), and there are references to past attempts as the user describes this as a frequent behavior.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the description of attempting suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (hanging oneself with a safety mechanism like a chair). There are signs of preparation, as the user describes intentionally leaving an object to stand on. However, since this refers to repeated actions rather than a new plan, it aligns more with past behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past and possibly ongoing events, as the user says ""attempt suicide frequently"" and describes how they perform these attempts, indicating historical actions rather than future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes concrete past actions of attempting suicide, which fits the 'Attempt' category. It goes beyond ideation or behavior by detailing actual attempts that have occurred, meeting the definition of historic actions.

At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation.

There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not go on (Yes), such as ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" and ""I guess this world's just not meant for me.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are mentioned in the post. The content focuses on past events and general feelings rather than current planning, so this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events, including a suicide attempt at age 14 and subsequent close calls. It also expresses current suicidal ideation (e.g., not wanting to go on), but there are no indications of future intentions or plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a statement about the user's age and living situation (""I am 29 still live with my parents""), which suggests general dissatisfaction or frustration. There are random strings of letters and the word ""fuckkkkkkkk,"" which may indicate emotional distress or anger. The string ""didieiridodiodididodidook"" could potentially be a misspelling or variation of ""die,"" but it's unclear and not explicitly related to death, suicide, or self-harm. No clear mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or past attempts are present. Emotional indicators point to frustration but not explicit hopelessness or despair.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""didie"" might vaguely hint at ""die,"" it is not clear or explicit. Per the instructions, if unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of past suicide attempts such as ""I tried to drown myself,"" ""I tried to hang,"" and ""I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor."" There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, depression, anxiety, guilt, and shame. The post expresses general dissatisfaction with life, family, career, and relationships, but the most critical elements are the references to self-harm attempts. No current plans or methods for future suicide are detailed, and there are no mentions of preparations like acquiring tools or writing notes.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through descriptions of past attempts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""Why should I still live and waste the resources"" and self-deprecating statements indicating a desire to end life.
   - The mentions are clear and not vague, so this goes beyond just indicators.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, methods like drowning, hanging, and jumping from a building are mentioned, but these are in the context of past attempts, not current or future plans.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post does not describe any preparations; it only recounts failed past actions.
   - Since these are historical and not indicative of ongoing behavior, this does not elevate to 'behavior' category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to past events (e.g., ""I tried to drown myself""), with current expressions of distress, but no indications of future intentions. The attempts are described as having occurred in the past and were not completed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes past suicide attempts, which aligns directly with the 'Attempt' category. It focuses on historic actions (e.g., trying to drown, hang, or jump), and while there are elements of ideation in the current distress, the explicit recounting of past attempts takes precedence. There are no current plans mentioned, so it fits 'Attempt' rather than 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'.

141,"Living is not for me and that's okay. I saw a post a while ago where someone said 'you know how going to college is not for everyone, I feel like life is the same' I have never related to something so much. Living is so frustrating for me, I have crippling anxiety for years with no treatment. Living is just so frustrating for someone like me, it doesn't help that i'm sensitive af and that my relationship with my mom sucks. To top it all off I have been doing nothing for the past year dropped out of college because I was burned out and quite my parttime job. If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old. I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself which is the only positive thing. I might actually get the courage to do it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration with life, crippling anxiety, a poor relationship with the poster's mom, dropping out of college, quitting a job, and a sense of hopelessness. There are mentions of suicide and killing oneself, such as ""if suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15,"" and the poster states they are becoming more confident to kill themselves and might get the courage to do it. Emotional indicators include despair, frustration, and anxiety. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts—only hypothetical thoughts from the past.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with words like ""suicide"" and ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as wishing they had ended their life at 15 and feeling more confident to do so.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. The post expresses growing confidence but lacks any concrete plan, so I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the instructions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to hypothetical past thoughts (e.g., at age 15) but focuses on current feelings and potential future actions, without describing an actual past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but there is no mention of a specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without concrete planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' since no past action is described.

142,Too much. Well it finally happened I got to the point where the pain is too much and the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better. I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of overwhelming pain and emotional distress, such as ""the pain is too much"" and references to hiding desires related to death. There are mentions of death and dying, specifically ""be dead in less than 24 hours."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair. Specific plans and methods are mentioned: ""I have enough Trazodone"" (a substance) and ""will get alcohol today"" (preparation). There are no clear references to past attempts, though the phrase ""if you wanted to die you would has taught me to hide it better"" might imply past thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""be dead in less than 24 hours."" Since this is a direct expression, it qualifies as more than vague, but I'll note the rules to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, this seems clear enough to proceed.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including Trazodone (a drug) and alcohol (substances for potential overdose). Signs of preparation include already having Trazodone and planning to acquire alcohol today. Since there is explicit mention of methods and preparations, this goes beyond ideation, but as per rules, if uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; here, it's clear enough for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This primarily refers to current and future intentions, such as getting alcohol today and being dead soon, rather than past events. No specific past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die and mentions specific plans (methods like Trazodone and alcohol, with preparations). This fits 'behavior' as it involves suicidal thoughts plus a plan. It's not 'indicator' due to the direct expressions, not 'ideation' due to the specific plan, and not 'attempt' as it's about future actions.

Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of ongoing hopelessness, negative thoughts, feelings of worthlessness, and dissatisfaction with life. There are mentions of past abuse and current emotional pain, but no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair, guilt, and a sense of meaninglessness.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although phrases like ""I want to give up"" and ""Why the fuck am I alive"" suggest distress, they are not direct or explicit expressions of suicidal intent. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. There are no signs of preparation, such as tools, locations, or plans. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's nothing to indicate even ideation-level planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past struggles (e.g., abuse since childhood) and current feelings, but there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness without any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

(Maybe cushion the pain idk. )I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of death and dying, such as ""let myself pass away,"" ""kill me,"" ""I'm going to die,"" and ""kill myself."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, as the user expresses a desire to die and achieve a skeletal appearance. Specific plans and methods are referenced, including using anorexia as a means to reach a goal weight of 78 pounds or lower to cause death. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""let myself pass away."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user states intentions to continue behaviors that will lead to death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as using anorexia and weight loss (from 90 pounds to 78 pounds or lower) as a way to achieve death. This implies a plan involving starvation. Signs of preparation are evident in the ongoing pursuit of this weight goal. Since a method is clearly described, this goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions, as the user discusses ongoing actions and goals rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts along with a specific plan (anorexia as a method to cause death), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' because a plan is present, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of ""suicide"" and a specific method involving a charcoal BBQ in a tent. There are no emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair expressed. It specifies a potential method (charcoal BBQ in a tent) but does not reference any preparations, past attempts, or personal desires.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as it's phrased as a question about possibility rather than a personal intent. However, the explicit mention of suicide leans toward further analysis.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a charcoal BBQ in a tent is specified as a potential method. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with the rule to consider it as planning, thus pointing toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a hypothetical or potential future scenario (asking if it's possible), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicide and includes a specific method (charcoal BBQ in a tent), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a mentioned plan or method. According to the definitions, when specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present, it should be classified as 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of self-loathing, hopelessness, and distress related to body image, gender dysphoria, relationships, and feelings of worthlessness. There are mentions of ""want to die"" and ""committing die"" (likely a typo for ""committing suicide"" or ""die""), which indicate thoughts of death. Emotional indicators include despair, self-consciousness, and a belief that others would be better off without the poster. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""want to die"" and ""committing die,"" which imply a desire to end one's life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""everything that makes me want to die"" and the idea that ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me."" Since these are direct expressions, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and thoughts, such as ongoing distress and desires, rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die and feelings that life is not worth living, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of ""Ideation,"" as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. There is no evidence of behavior or past attempts, and while the expressions are explicit, they do not meet the threshold for behavior.

We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time.

I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of emotional pain from a relationship fight, feelings of hopelessness, and direct statements about wanting to die. There are mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" ""I just feel like dying""). Emotional indicators include despair, hurt, and a sense of not caring. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" which are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and emotions from a recent event (the fight), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'Indicator', and there's no evidence of planning or past attempts, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of distress, such as tiredness from yelling and fighting, thoughts of hurting others (e.g., ""Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone?""), desires for negative experiences to happen to themselves (e.g., wanting sexual assault or a horrible disease for validation), and self-loathing (e.g., ""I'm an abomination""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like ""I can't do it anymore"" and the analogy of being a ""sick dog"" that might need to be ""put down."" However, there are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The ""put down"" reference is metaphorical and relates to an animal, not explicitly to the user's own life. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; while there are thoughts of self-harm indirectly through desires for bad things to happen, there is no clear expression of wanting to end one's life.
   - Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No; there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but since no plan or method is evident, it doesn't qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around""), with no mention of past events or attempts. It's focused on ongoing distress rather than historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and disturbing thoughts, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, and when in doubt, I must choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt' due to the absence of explicit suicide references or plans.

Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions suicide multiple times (e.g., ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" ""suicide pact""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""horrid hole of thoughts,"" ""torment of thoughts,"" ""I am so fucking delicate,"" and feelings of being different or unable to connect. Specific preparations are noted, like ""drafted my will"" and considerations about not using household weapons or involving others. No direct self-harm or methods are detailed, and no past attempts are referenced.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., it feels like an obligation, plotting seriously, sense of relief from thoughts).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly (no tools or locations detailed), but preparations are indicated, such as drafting a will. This suggests planning rather than just thoughts.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (drafting a will is a form of preparation). Since preparations are present, this leans toward 'behavior,' but instructions emphasize choosing 'ideation' if unsure about explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and ongoing intentions (e.g., ""on and off for months,"" ""Yesterday, I drafted my will,"" ""Today, I feel better""), with no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of desire to die, which goes beyond 'indicator.' It also mentions preparations like drafting a will, indicating a plan, which aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.' Although methods aren't fully detailed, the presence of preparations tips the scale to 'behavior' based on the definition.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of frustration, stress, anxiety, and feelings of being mocked and abused by someone named Z. The user mentions emotional distress from interactions involving their ex, feelings of isolation (""if I leave them I have no one""), and a statement ""I feel like he would be better off without me,"" which hints at low self-worth but does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life, such as getting abused at home and the ineffectiveness of ""tough love.""

Emotional indicators include despair, anger, and fatigue, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post expresses general distress and anger toward others and the world, but it does not include any explicit desire for the poster to end their own life.

I'm so sick of sitting inside all day, waiting for the next day in hopes it will somehow be the day where everything changes. I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life. And at this rate, I really feel like nothing is going to change. It's been so stagnant for so long. Everyone I know has a great job, a great relationship, their own apartment; they're all moving forward in life, meanwhile I'm still sitting in the same house that I grew up in. I'm so sick of this. I've always been a melancholic guy, but I really want to give life a chance. I want to have financial independence, a girlfriend, hobbies, and see where it takes me. But it seems like the world rejects me at every turn. I've always prided myself on being a pretty tough and resilient person, but I've reached a point where I really don't know what's next for me. I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, frustration, and stagnation, such as not having a job after graduating college, pushing away friends, feeling isolated, lacking purpose, and comparing oneself to others who are progressing. Emotional indicators include feelings of melancholy, being sick of their current life, and a sense that nothing will change, with phrases like ""the walls are closing in."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states, ""I don't want to kill myself,"" which is a direct reference but in the form of denial. However, there are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive; instead, the user expresses a desire to improve their life and give it a chance. Given the rules, when in doubt, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation,' and this denial does not constitute an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since there's no indication of planning, this does not qualify for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post primarily refers to current feelings and past events (e.g., graduating college), but there are no references to past suicide attempts or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress and sadness but lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or plans. The mention of not wanting to kill oneself is a denial, not an indication of ideation. Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' category, as per the definition that emphasizes general dissatisfaction without explicit suicide mentions.

Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" and ""suicidal thoughts and ideations."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""Life just gets more and more overwhelming and difficult,"" ""I'm just in a rut with a very small support system,"" and feelings of being ""weak and pathetic."" There are hints of a plan, such as wanting to act ""tomorrow while my mom is out,"" and possibly contacting people before ""try and go out,"" but no specific methods, tools, or preparations are detailed. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" and ""I want to kill myself."" 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as seen in the explicit desires to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, substances, or locations, though a time (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") and vague action (""try and go out"") are referenced, which could imply intent but not a clear plan. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, as there's no mention of acquiring means or writing notes. Since it's uncertain if this constitutes a specific plan, I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I want to die tomorrow""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, which rules out 'indicator.' It does not include specific methods or preparations, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.' There are no descriptions of past attempts, eliminating 'attempt.' Therefore, it best fits 'ideation,' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a detailed plan.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of emotional distress such as feeling ""dead inside,"" ""sad,"" ""anhedonic,"" and a sense of hopelessness about life's uselessness and the temporary nature of good days. There are mentions of a past depressive episode, but no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The phrase ""yeet myself way too much"" is slang that could vaguely imply self-harm or wanting to end one's life, but it's not clear or direct. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""yeet myself"" might suggest a vague desire, it's not direct or explicit. Since it's unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's no indication of any plan, so it doesn't qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events (a depressive episode) and current feelings of sadness, but there's no description of past suicide attempts or clear future intentions beyond vague emotional expressions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general distress, sadness, and hopelessness, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or direct expressions of wanting to die. While ""yeet myself"" hints at possible suicidal thoughts, it's not explicit enough to qualify as 'ideation'. Following the rules to lean toward 'indicator' when in doubt, this fits best under 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses frustration, hopelessness, and regret about life events like potentially losing a job and license, feeling like a loser, and isolation from friends. There are mentions of a past suicide attempt (""I tried to end it once before"") and a wish that it had succeeded (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded""). Emotional indicators include despair and dissatisfaction with life. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for future actions are mentioned. References to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""I tried to end it once before"" and ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the context of wishing the past attempt had succeeded.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about methods, tools, locations, or preparations for any suicide action.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no explicit planning is present, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers primarily to past events (the attempt) and current feelings of regret and hopelessness, but no explicit future intentions or plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""I tried to end it once before""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. There are no current plans mentioned, so it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior'. While there are expressions of suicidal thoughts (wishing success in the past attempt), the defining element is the description of a historical action, making 'Attempt' the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to ""give up and just get it over with,"" which implies a desire to end one's life, though not explicitly stated as suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" indicate a desire to end life. Since this is not entirely unclear, it leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no explicit planning, so this would not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ongoing despair and questioning the point of continuing), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to not be alive (""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?""), but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of Ideation, as it involves suicidal feelings without planning.

Emotional indicators include feeling stupid, crying, and getting offended easily, which suggest distress and possible hopelessness. There is a mention of ""suicidal thoughts,"" but no references to death, dying, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post states ""I currently have suicidal thoughts."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as ""suicidal thoughts"" implies a desire to end one's life. Since this is explicit, it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or any plans, so this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings (""currently have suicidal thoughts""), not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""planning to commit suicide,"" ""end it""), expressions of hopelessness and despair (""My life won't ever be the same,"" ""I'll never be happy if I continue to live,"" ""I have to go,"" ""I have no choice but to end it""), and emotional indicators like anger and sadness about life's circumstances.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""planning to commit suicide"" and ""end it."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I have to go"" and ""no choice but to end it."" Since these are clear, this leans away from 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation?

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""end it""), but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This fits 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without the elements required for 'Behavior.' It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of regret, embarrassment, mental instability, and distress (e.g., ""I want to rip my hair out,"" indicating self-harm ideation). There are direct mentions of ""attempting suicide"" and being ""so close to attempting suicide."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and dread about living with family. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There is a reference to a near-attempt but not a completed one.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes – the post directly references ""attempting suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes – it implies a desire to attempt suicide as an alternative to current circumstances.
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No – no details on tools, locations, substances, or preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No – only general references to the idea of attempting suicide.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to recent past events (being close to attempting suicide) and current feelings (regret and dreading the future), but not a completed past attempt. It's focused on thoughts that were imminent but not acted upon.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to attempt suicide), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no actual past action occurred.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as ""I cant take it,"" ""the pain makes me want to scream and break everything,"" and ""Its excruciating."" These indicate high levels of pain and frustration.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There is a direct mention of ""I wont kill myself,"" which references suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are implied through the description of unbearable pain.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I wont kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as the post denies any intention and focuses on pain rather than a desire to end life.
   - Since it's unclear if this constitutes a full expression of suicidal thoughts (it's negated), lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the rules.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here there's no indication of any plan, so it doesn't reach 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings of pain and distress, with no reference to past events or future intentions.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general distress and mentions suicide explicitly but in a denying context without any desire to die, plans, or indications of suicidal thoughts. Given the rules to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions, this fits 'indicator' best, as it lacks a clear expression of suicidal desires or feelings.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration with appearance, gender dysphoria, and a desire to be male. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show distress related to societal pressures and personal identity, such as hating makeup and girly clothing, but there's no explicit hopelessness or despair tied to suicidal thoughts. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on gender dissatisfaction without any reference to ending life, so I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there's no indication of any planning, this doesn't qualify for 'behavior', and I choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' due to the absence of suicidal thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and frustrations but does not mention past events, past attempts, or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., gender dysphoria), but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses self-hatred, a wish for courage to ""end it all,"" and a contrasting desire to endure and support others. It includes emotional indicators of hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, but also hope and encouragement. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past attempts.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: The phrase ""end it all"" implies a desire related to suicide but is not explicitly stated as such.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and self-loathing are present, alongside positive affirmations.
   - Specific plans or methods: None identified.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as ""end it all"" is indirect and idiomatic, not a direct reference like ""commit suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, it's vague and not explicit.
   - Since it's unclear if this counts as explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' per the rules.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general distress and vague expressions of wanting to end suffering, but without explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Per the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not very explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, I must choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""almost committed suicide,"" indicating a reference to suicide. It also includes expressions of not wanting to be alive (""if my friends didn't exist i probably wouldn't be alive right now"") and ongoing consideration (""i still consider""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, severe anxiety, dissatisfaction with life, family issues, and isolation. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, but it references a past event. No self-harm is explicitly described beyond the past reference.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""almost committed suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through phrases like ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now"" and ""i still consider.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, only that the person ""didn't have anything to do it with,"" which implies a lack of means without detailing any.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as notes or acquiring tools.
   - Since no specific plan is detailed, this leans toward ideation, but the past reference complicates it.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event (""a few days ago i almost committed suicide"") and current intentions (""i still consider""). The past element suggests an incomplete attempt, while the current part indicates ongoing thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and refers to a past attempt (""almost committed suicide""), which aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' as it describes a historical action, even if not fully completed. Additionally, it mentions current plans or considerations, triggering the rule to label it as 'Attempt' when both past attempts and current elements are present. Therefore, 'Attempt' fits best over 'Ideation' or others.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post repeatedly mentions ""suicide,"" including phrases like ""suicide with me,"" ""can anyone suicide with me together,"" and ""for those want to suicide too."" This indicates a direct reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include a sense of desperation or a call for others to join, suggesting hopelessness. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations, such as tools, locations, or substances. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used multiple times.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a desire to suicide and invites others, implying their own intent to die.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so this goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring items or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since no specific plan is evident, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current or future intentions, as it's a present call for action, not a description of past events.
   - No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to die, which qualifies as 'ideation' since there are no specific plans or methods. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'behavior' due to the absence of any plan, and not 'attempt' as it doesn't describe past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of wanting to ""kms"" (kill myself), a desire to hang oneself, emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, and specific references to preparations like packing up the apartment and resigning from a job. There are mentions of death and suicide, emotional distress, a specific method (hanging with a rope), signs of partial action (putting the rope around the neck and practicing hanging), and fear of failing or ending up in ICU. No clear references to past attempts beyond the recent practice.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""want to kms,"" ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods mentioned? Yes (hanging with a rope). Signs of preparation? Yes, such as discussing the need for the apartment to be packed and job resigned, and the act of putting the rope around the neck and practicing. Since there is evidence of a method and partial action, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers primarily to current and immediate intentions (e.g., ""I really want to hang myself right now,"" ""I can't stop thinking about killing myself,"" ""trying again""), with a description of a very recent action (practicing hanging). It involves both past immediate behavior and ongoing plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a described recent action (practicing hanging, which is a concrete behavior). Additionally, it mentions current plans. According to the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'. Therefore, this fits 'attempt' best.

I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead. Then he will survive, then he won't need to work out a way to keep two people afloat with only his job. He'll only need to focus on himself and I'll finally be at peace. I told him today. I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes multiple mentions of suicide, dying, and self-harm, such as ""I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""This job has been making me violently suicidal,"" and ""suicidal ideation."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, sobbing, feeling overwhelmed, and being a failure. There is a specific method mentioned: ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" No references to past attempts are present; it's focused on current and future intentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""violently suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" and ""I just want to fucking die."" 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I just want to fucking die"" and ""I'll die a failure.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post references ""getting a gun"" as a potential method. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the mention of a specific method (gun) indicates planning. Based on the guidelines, this qualifies as 'behavior' since specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers primarily to current and future intentions, with phrases like ""I'm finally going to actually do it"" and ""I'm going to go through with it."" No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post goes beyond general distress by explicitly mentioning suicidal thoughts and a specific method (gun), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It includes explicit planning, so 'behavior' fits best over 'ideation' or 'indicator.'

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead.

I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and suicide, such as ""full intentions to end things"" and references to not wanting to be dead. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like feelings of isolation, apathy from others, and a desire to ""sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb."" There are signs of a specific plan, as the user describes driving to the mountains with the intention to end things, which implies preparation by traveling to a location. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""full intentions to end things"" and indirect expressions related to not wanting to be dead.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as indicated by the user's statements about ending things and hoping someone cares.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly (e.g., no tools or exact methods like jumping), but a location (mountains) is implied as part of the plan, which could be a suitable site for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user drove to the mountains with the intention, indicating preparation.
   - Since there is evidence of planning through actions taken, this leans toward 'behavior,' but if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation'; however, the preparation is clear enough.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a recent or current intention (just finished driving with intentions), not past events. No past attempts are described; it's focused on what just happened and the user's current state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a plan/preparation (driving to the mountains), which fits the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the described actions taken.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of death and dying (""I'm ready to die"", ""I'm ready"", ""ready to go""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""nothing in my life is changing"", ""Fuck this world""), and references to preparations (""The date was set a while ago"", ""I even changed it"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go""). There are no mentions of specific methods like tools or substances, but preparations are implied. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I'm ready to die"" and expressions of wanting to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""I'm ready to die"" and overall context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly (e.g., no tools or locations detailed), but there are signs of preparation (""The date was set"", ""Preps being made"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go""), which indicate planning. Since preparations are mentioned, this leans toward explicit planning rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past actions related to planning (""The date was set a while ago"", ""I even changed it"") but primarily focuses on current or future intentions (""I'm ready"", ""Preps being made"", ""ready to go""). There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die) and mentions of preparations and a set date, which qualify as explicit planning. This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it involves both suicidal thoughts and indications of a plan, per the definition. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' due to the presence of planning, and not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct statement about thinking of ending one's life, references to past struggles such as developing OCD in 2017, dropping grades, being kicked out of school, depression, lashing out, hating the current course, and social isolation with friends ditching the person. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I'm thinking of ending my life."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the statement expresses a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., OCD development in 2017, school issues) and current feelings (e.g., thinking of ending life, current dissatisfaction). It does not describe any past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to end life) but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post includes phrases like ""its working!"", ""hopefully this is my last post on here"", and ""pls let me never wake up"". The phrase ""pls let me never wake up"" implies a desire for death or not continuing to live. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, as the user expresses a wish for this to be their final post and to not wake up. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""pls let me never wake up"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive.
   - This is not unclear, as it qualifies as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, so it leans toward 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, this fits 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., hoping to never wake up), not past events.
   - There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""pls let me never wake up""), which meets the criteria for 'ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It is not 'indicator' because there is a direct expression of wanting to die. It is not 'behavior' due to the absence of any plan or method. It is not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions 42 unnamed pills (possibly antidepressants) and allergy medicine as potential means for suicide. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""which obviously didnt work haha,"" ""im really out of it,"" and ""im so ready to die."" Specific plans or methods are referenced, including the pills being easy to swallow and the intention to use them. There are references to past behaviors where the user has posted about wanting to do it but didn't follow through, but no explicit past attempts are described.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""im gonna do it"" and ""im so ready to die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""im so ready to die"" and the context of having means to act.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details the pills (42 unnamed ones and allergy medicine) as methods, describing them as easy to swallow, which implies preparation for overdose.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user states they have the means and plans to act ""tonight,"" indicating active preparation.
   - Since specific methods and preparations are mentioned, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past postings (past events of ideation) but primarily focuses on current/future intentions, such as acting ""tonight.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past thoughts or threats are mentioned, not actual attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (using pills tonight), which fits the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning methods and preparations, but it does not describe a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of extreme tiredness, loneliness, feelings of being unloved, struggles with mental illness since childhood, anxiety about opening up, and a desire to escape.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions a desire to ""check out,"" which is a euphemism for dying or suicide. It explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" and expresses a lack of moral objection to it. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and exhaustion, such as ""running on nothing but sheer spite,"" ""held on for so long,"" and ""even spite has its limits."" There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is directly used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I really want to check out"" indicate a desire to end one's life.
   - This is clear, so it goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing notes is indicated.
   - Since no plan is present, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts, only ongoing thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to ""check out"" and no moral issue with suicide), but lacks any specific plan or method, making it best categorized as 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme emotional distress such as ""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im in so much pain and i cant handle it anymore,"" ""i cant,"" ""im done,"" and a farewell message thanking people and wishing them well. This suggests hopelessness and despair. There are indirect mentions of ending life through phrases like ""im going to do it"" and ""im done,"" which imply suicidal intent without explicitly stating ""suicide."" No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""im going to do it"" and ""im done"" indicate a desire to end one's life, though it's indirect. Since it's not crystal clear and the rules instruct to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I must consider this carefully.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The farewell message could hint at preparation, but it's not explicit (e.g., no mention of a suicide note or acquiring means). Since there's uncertainty about an explicit plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""im going to do it,"" which suggests an imminent action. No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to end life via ""im going to do it""), fitting the 'Ideation' category, as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'Indicator.' It's not 'Behavior' due to the lack of explicit planning details, and per rules, I lean toward 'Ideation' if unsure about a plan. It's also not 'Attempt' since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating a desire for self-harm or suicide. Emotional indicators include stress, the idea that suicide would be ""easier,"" and hopelessness about the future (""I've never really seen myself going anywhere in life so. why not""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, just an inquiry about a painless way. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements implying it would be easier and questioning life's purpose.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post asks for a ""mostly painless way"" but does not specify any tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of any preparations like acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since no explicit plan is described, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., current stress and thoughts about suicide), not past events. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die), but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the 'ideation' category. It's not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'behavior' without a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses the dangers and painful effects of overdosing as a suicide method. It mentions suicide explicitly (e.g., ""commit suicide""), describes the process of dying from an overdose (e.g., vomiting, liver damage), and warns against it. There are no emotional indicators of the writer's own hopelessness or despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are indicated for the writer themselves. No references to past attempts by the writer.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""commit suicide"" and descriptions of overdosing as a way to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post does not express the writer's own desires; it appears to advise someone else.
   - Since the mentions are not about the writer's own thoughts, and the rules emphasize that risk applies only to the writer, this leans toward not being ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, overdosing on pills is detailed, including effects like vomiting and liver failure.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications that the writer is preparing or planning anything; it's descriptive and advisory.
   - No explicit plan from the writer, so if considering, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this doesn't apply directly as it's not the writer's intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to potential future scenarios in a hypothetical, advisory way, not the writer's own past or intentions.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide, but these are not expressions of the writer's own suicidal thoughts or feelings; it's directed at someone else (e.g., ""Don't take the pills""). The rules specify that suicide risk is only for the person writing the post. Therefore, there are no explicit expressions of the writer's desire to die, plans, or attempts. This fits best under 'Indicator' as it lacks direct indication of the writer's suicidal risk, and when in doubt about explicit mentions related to the writer, choose 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of mental health issues, lack of motivation to live, and vague references to ""doing it"" in the future, which implies suicide based on context. There are emotional indicators such as hopelessness and being held back only by family concerns. No mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the post uses vague language like ""im gonna do it"" without directly stating ""suicide"" or ""killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, with phrases like ""no motivation to keep on living"" and ""ill do it when im fed up,"" but these are not explicit enough per the guidelines. Since it's unclear and not very explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No. If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the lack of any plan means it doesn't reach 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""in the future"" and ""when im fed up""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general dissatisfaction and hopelessness but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to kill oneself.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of anger and resentment towards the user's parents for having them, leading to a life of psychological torture due to lack of care. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include feelings of hopelessness and despair implied through the description of a ""psychologically tortured"" life, but these are general rather than specific. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on dissatisfaction with life and parents but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die. Since it's unclear and leans toward general distress, I am choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning or methods, so this does not factor into a higher category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (parents' decisions and lack of care) but expresses current feelings of distress. There are no references to past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general dissatisfaction and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it involves distress without direct suicidal expressions.

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post are a description of a vivid nightmare involving foreign men committing mass murder in a school and the user's home, leading to a severe panic attack upon waking. Emotional indicators include terror, anxiety about sleeping, and a sense of real threat from the dream. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the user. The post focuses on the dream's content and seeks explanations or coping strategies, without any references to specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses fear and distress from a nightmare, which does not involve suicidal thoughts. Since there are no such mentions, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? The post describes methods in the context of the dream (e.g., slicing people, breaking into homes), but these are not related to the user's own suicide or self-harm. There are no signs of preparation for suicide. As there is no indication of any plan related to the user, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a recent dream (past event) and current feelings of anxiety, but there are no references to past suicide attempts or current/future intentions regarding suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains expressions of distress and hopelessness related to a nightmare, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, plans, or attempts. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'indicator' as there are no suicidal elements, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is preferred.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions past overdoses, with one being intentional, which relates to self-harm and suicide attempts. It includes emotional indicators like fear, despair, and a desire to end suffering. There's a plea for strength and a reason to ""do it,"" implying a wish to end life, but no specific plans or methods for future actions are detailed. References to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to overdosing on purpose.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in phrases like ""give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" and ""so I can do it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, past overdose is mentioned, but this is not for current or future plans. No signs of current preparation are evident.
   - Since no explicit plan for the future is described, this leans away from 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (overdoses) and current feelings (desire to end suffering), but the past attempts are the concrete actions described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (intentional overdose), which fits the 'Attempt' category. Even though there are elements of current suicidal thoughts, the explicit mention of a past concrete action (overdose on purpose) makes 'Attempt' the best fit, as per the definition that prioritizes historic actions.

I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's mention of being ""suicidal again,"" expressions of emotional distress such as low mood, hurting their significant other, and fear of stressing them further. There are indicators of hopelessness, like running out of meds and not getting a refill. No mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states, ""I'm suicidal again."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, this implies a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and recent events (e.g., running out of meds), not past attempts or future intentions with specifics.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts, indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category.

There is a mention of wanting to die, which relates to death or dying, but no references to self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include feelings of worthlessness and general dissatisfaction with life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""I want to die more than ever,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current feelings and intentions, such as ongoing anxiety and the desire to die. The phrase ""Everytime I try I fail"" may hint at past general failures but does not specifically describe past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die more than ever""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any mention of a specific plan or method.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of ""suicide by hanging,"" which is a method of suicide. There are emotional indicators of uncertainty and a desire for honesty, suggesting distress. Specific plans or methods are referenced, as the user states ""ive alr tied the noose,"" indicating preparation of a tool for hanging. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Indirectly, through inquiring about the method, but not explicitly stated as a desire. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans toward a higher category than 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ""suicide by hanging"" and ""tied the noose,"" which is a preparation involving a tool. This indicates explicit planning, as the user has already taken a step toward carrying out the act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current preparations (""ive alr tied the noose"") and potential future intentions (inquiring about the experience), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide and specific preparations (tying the noose), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves suicidal thoughts plus a plan or method. It goes beyond 'ideation' due to the clear indication of preparation.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of self-loathing (""I'm a pervert""), distress about uncontrollable feelings (""I can't help my sexual feelings""), and direct mentions of wanting to die (""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die because of them""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, but no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes) through the phrase ""Should I kill myself?"" There are also direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes) with ""I want to die because of them."" This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. There are no signs of preparation. Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I want to die""), not past events or attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses strong hatred towards the user's dad and family, mentions past sexual assault by the grandfather, and includes emotional indicators of anger, frustration, and hopelessness (e.g., ""i hate everything""). There is a phrase ""i just wanna end it,"" which suggests a desire to end one's life, but it does not explicitly mention suicide, self-harm, death, or dying in detail. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described. There are references to past events (sexual assault), but not to past suicide attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wanna end it"" implies a desire to end one's life, though it is somewhat vague and not highly explicit.
   - Since this is not crystal clear, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' if in doubt, per the rules.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's no indication of planning at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., sexual assault) and current feelings of hatred and despair. The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" seems to indicate current intentions rather than past actions. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes a vague expression of wanting to end it, which could imply suicidal thoughts, but it lacks explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicide mentions should be 'indicator'. Given the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions, this fits best as 'indicator' rather than 'ideation'.

And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to feeling unable to cope in the past, going vagrant as an alternative to suicide, and implying that this choice ""saved"" the writer. There are emotional indicators of past hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, such as not coping and leaving for a vagrant lifestyle. However, there are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. References to past events suggest an alternative to suicide was chosen, but no suicide attempt is described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in the phrase ""on the brink of suicide,"" but this is presented as advice for others, not a direct expression from the writer about their own thoughts. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the writer implies past distress but does not explicitly state a desire to die. Since the mention is not clearly explicit for the writer and is indirect, I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or preparations related to suicide. The post describes going vagrant as a coping mechanism, which is not a suicide plan. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's no indication of any plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events (e.g., occasions where the writer felt unable to cope and chose to go vagrant). There are no references to current or future intentions regarding suicide, and no past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post expresses general past dissatisfaction and hopelessness but lacks explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts or feelings from the writer. The reference to suicide is vague and not directly tied to the writer's current or explicit past desires, so it fits best under 'Indicator'. When in doubt about explicit mentions, the guidelines specify choosing 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, loneliness, addiction, regret, and a desire to end life. Specifically, the post mentions ""I can't go on anymore,"" ""I fucked up my life,"" and ""then end it,"" which indicate thoughts of death or suicide. Emotional indicators include ongoing worsening of life, isolation, and missing happiness. There are no mentions of self-harm methods, tools, or specific preparations beyond being currently drunk. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""end it"" directly implies ending one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""then end it"" express a desire to die.
   - The language is explicit enough to move beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, substances (beyond being drunk), or locations for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post mentions being drunk now and planning to ""end it"" tonight, which could suggest some immediate context, but it's not explicit preparation like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since the plan is vague and lacks specifics, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a vague intention to act tonight, but without a specific plan or method. This fits 'Ideation' as it involves desires to die without detailed planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to lack of specific methods, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

There is a direct reference to ending one's life, indicating a desire to die. Emotional indicators are present through the explicit intent to end life, suggesting hopelessness. No references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the phrase ""end my life"" directly expresses a desire to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user is asking if they can successfully end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including codeine and ibuprofen, which are substances that could be used for overdose. This indicates signs of preparation, as the user states they have access to these items. Since specific methods are detailed, this goes beyond vague thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is inquiring about the success of a potential action with the substances they currently have. No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) and mentions specific methods (codeine and ibuprofen), which constitute explicit planning. This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it involves both suicidal thoughts and a plan, per the definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, failure, and despair. Phrases like ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""i cant do this anymore,"" and ""i cant stand being here any other moment"" suggest a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include ongoing suffering, unhappiness, and a sense of wasted life. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases such as ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" and ""i cant stand being here any other moment"" directly express a desire to not be alive.
   - Although not using the exact term ""suicide,"" the expressions are explicit enough to indicate suicidal thoughts, but per instructions, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.' However, the desire to end life is sufficiently direct here.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward acting on thoughts.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""everyday i ran out of reasons,"" ""i cant live like this for the rest of my life""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) without any specific plan, which aligns with 'ideation.' It goes beyond general dissatisfaction by directly indicating a desire not to be alive, but lacks elements of planning or past actions. If in doubt about explicitness, 'indicator' should be chosen, but the phrasing here is direct enough for 'ideation.'

There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and distress, as the user is contemplating how to inform loved ones about this possibility. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""commit suicide"" is used directly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a probable intention to commit suicide in the future. Since it is explicit, this goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no explicit plan is present, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

There are emotional indicators like boredom leading to suicidal thoughts and a desire to be calm. The post explicitly references ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" and questions if taking 3 Xanax pills could lead to death, implying consideration of a method. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post states ""suicidal thoughts are always there."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the context of suicidal thoughts and inquiring about dying from pills, though they say ""i dont wanna die rn,"" which contrasts with the overall intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, taking 3 Xanax pills is specified as a potential method. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the statement ""i will do it anyway"" indicates intent to act on this method. This goes beyond ideation into explicit planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of self-loathing (""shitface,"" ""fucking monster,"" ""piece of human garbage""), emotional distress related to a relationship, mentions of self-harm (""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing""), and a direct reference to suicide (""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide beyond the self-harm inquiry. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""i will wait until I can kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as indicated by the suicide mention and the context of self-harm.
   - The mentions are clear, so this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? There is a question about places for self-harm without detection, which relates to self-harm rather than a direct suicide method. This does not specify tools, locations, or substances for suicide itself.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of acquiring means or making preparations.
   - Since there is no explicit plan for suicide, and the guidelines instruct to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this fits ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (e.g., ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to kill oneself) but lacks any specific plan or preparation for suicide. Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category, as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing methods or behaviors.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide (""Im probably going to kill myself soon"" and ""strong urge to"" kill myself), expressions of wanting not to be alive (""i just wish i wasn't even born""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""the only people i have in my life dont care,"" ""They dont make any effort to keep me around,"" and ""life is fucking stupid""). There are no mentions of specific methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""strong urge to"" kill myself and ""wish i wasn't even born.""
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so this goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since no specific plan is present, this fits ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""probably going to kill myself soon"" and ""strong urge lately""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'ideation.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide mentions, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as there are no past actions.

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of temptation to end one's life, specifically by jumping from the highest floor, which implies death or severe harm. There are mentions of death (""plummet to the ground,"" ""end up crippled instead of a corpse"") and emotional indicators like guilt, fear, and internal conflict, suggesting despair and hopelessness. No specific preparations are mentioned, but a method (jumping from a height) is described. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post expresses temptation to ""plummet to the ground"" and references becoming a ""corpse,"" indicating a desire to die.
   - Since the expressions are direct about ending life, even without the word ""suicide,"" this leans toward explicit rather than vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies a method: going to the highest floor and jumping to the ground, which is a clear location and means for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as acquiring tools or writing a note, but the description of the method qualifies as explicit planning.
   - If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here the plan is evident, so it fits 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current temptation and future intentions (""so tempted to just go""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and a specific plan (jumping from the highest floor), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond vague ideation by detailing a method, so 'Behavior' is the best fit. If it lacked the specific method, it might be 'Ideation,' but the planning element makes 'Behavior' appropriate.

There are emotional indicators suggesting distress, as the user is contemplating suicide in response to potentially hurting their boyfriend, implying feelings of guilt or hopelessness. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include descriptions of standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage, trying to work up the nerve to jump, and repeated visits to this location. There are mentions of death and dying, as the user references attempting to jump (a method of suicide) and notes an incident where someone else died the same way 6 years ago. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, isolation, and a desire for someone to notice and care, as seen in phrases like ""I can never get the nerve to jump"" and ""hoping someone will stop me."" There are no explicit references to self-harm beyond the suicidal context, and no specific preparations like acquiring tools are mentioned, but the repeated behavior of going to the ledge could imply preparation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user describes trying to work up the nerve to jump from a ledge, which directly implies a suicidal act.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements like ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"" and the ongoing attempts to gain courage to jump.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the method is jumping from the ledge of a hospital parking garage, which is a specific location and means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user describes repeatedly going to the location, standing or sitting there for up to an hour, and trying to build up courage, which indicates behavioral preparation.
   - Since specific ideas of how to commit suicide (location and method) are present, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to current and ongoing intentions, as the user describes repeated present actions (e.g., standing on the ledge now). There is a reference to a past event (someone else's suicide 6 years ago), but no description of the user's own past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific method (jumping from the ledge), along with signs of preparation (repeated visits to the location). This fits the 'behavior' category, as it involves explicit planning and ongoing actions. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'ideation' because of the specific method, and not 'attempt' since no past action by the user is described.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of long-term depression since 2nd grade, worsening life circumstances (e.g., parents' deaths, abuse, arrest for shrooms, academic and job struggles), emotional indicators of hopelessness and exhaustion, specific references to past suicide attempts (e.g., using a phone charger as a substitute for rope), multiple attempts, and current actions like searching for ways to kill themselves that look like an accident. There are expressions of wanting to die and thoughts of the impact on family.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., past attempts and searching for methods).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., viewing death as the ultimate answer and past vows to die in combat).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., phone charger for a past attempt and recently searching for ways to make death look like an accident).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., searching for methods indicates potential preparation, though not fully detailed).
   - Since there are indications of methods and searching, this leans toward explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., previous suicide attempts) and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing struggles and recent searching for ways to end life).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes past suicide attempts and also mentions current plans (e.g., searching for methods), which per the definitions and rules, qualifies it as 'Attempt' rather than just 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of betrayal, loneliness, and frustration from interpersonal relationships. Phrases like ""more dead inside"" suggest emotional numbness or despair, but it's metaphorical and not literal. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, such as ""nobody cares about me"" and ""done with everything."" No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""more dead inside"" is vague and metaphorical, indicating emotional pain rather than a literal desire to die. ""Done with everything"" expresses general exhaustion and dissatisfaction but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to end one's life. Given the instructions to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, this supports 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but nothing here suggests even ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and experiences (e.g., recent betrayal), not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it involves vague emotional dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is preferred over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of jumping off, specifically from the bedroom window, with details about trees and mud below to make it seem less scary. There are emotional indicators such as gaining courage and hoping to do it soon, which suggest building resolve towards a potentially lethal action. No direct mentions of death or suicide, but the context implies self-harm. No specific preparations like acquiring tools are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, but the post implies a desire to end life through jumping. Since it's not explicit, I would lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the overall context points to suicidal intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as jumping out of the bedroom window, with details about the environment (trees and mud below). This indicates a specific plan or method. There are no clear signs of preparation like writing a note, but the description qualifies as a plan. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it seems explicit enough to indicate planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm getting more courage,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon""), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes expressions of suicidal thoughts (implied desire to end life) and mentions a specific plan (jumping from the window with details), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond just ideation due to the explicit method described.

There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist?

It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's hesitation to share their issues with their mom, family mental illness, pressure to be perfect, reluctance to seek therapy, and expressions of depression. There are mentions of suicide through ""writing suicide notes,"" which relates to self-harm or suicidal behavior. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as feeling like they'd waste a therapist's time and that depression hits hard. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed beyond the vague reference to writing notes. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user mentions ""writing suicide notes."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the context of depression leading to writing suicide notes, which implies suicidal thoughts. Since this is explicit, it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? The mention of writing suicide notes could suggest some preparation, but it's not explicit or detailed enough to qualify as a full plan. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or recurrent feelings and intentions (e.g., ""sometimes depression hits really hard""), rather than past events. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., writing suicide notes), indicating a desire related to not wanting to live, but without any specific plan or method. This fits 'Ideation' as there are no details of preparations or methods that would elevate it to 'Behavior.' It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, and it's not 'Attempt' since no past actions are described.

There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""hope i die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""hope i die"" and ""fuck me fuck da world."" This is explicit enough to move beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions, such as ongoing mental suffering and immediate expressions of hopelessness. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wishing to die), but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the 'Ideation' category, as it involves desires to not be alive without detailing how to act on them.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post states ""Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,"" which appears to be a shorthand or typo for ""Just cut too deep, fuck."" This could imply self-harm, such as cutting oneself, and expresses frustration or distress through the word ""fuck."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or explicit self-harm plans. Emotional indicators include possible anger or regret, but no clear hopelessness or despair. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post implies an action (cutting) but does not express a desire to end life.
   - The content is unclear and lacks explicit suicidal language, so I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The word ""cut"" might vaguely refer to a method of self-harm, but it is not detailed or specific (e.g., no tools or locations are mentioned). 
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no clear explicit plan, and the guidelines instruct to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It seems to refer to a recent or current action (""Just cut""), but it is ambiguous and not explicitly tied to past attempts or future plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or specific plans, making it fall under 'Indicator.' General distress is present, but without mentioning suicide or a clear desire to end life, it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation,' 'Behavior,' or 'Attempt.' When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over other categories.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include frustration and anger towards people giving unsolicited advice, such as ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else."" The poster expresses sarcasm and resentment, implying that they are dealing with involuntary feelings (e.g., ""what I'm feeling is something I do by choice""), which could suggest emotional distress or misery. However, there are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include anger, sarcasm, and a sense of being fed upon by others' actions, but no explicit hopelessness or despair is described. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post expresses general dissatisfaction and emotional distress through venting about external criticism, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, desires to die, plans, or past attempts. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks any direct expression concerning suicide. Even with implied misery, the guidelines specify that without explicit suicide mentions, it should be classified as 'Indicator'. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of confusion and indecision about life, a direct mention of wanting to die (""i kinda just wanna die""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., struggling to get up, finding everything boring, friends as the only motivator, getting bullied, stopping school attendance, poor grades). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""i kinda just wanna die,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive. This goes beyond vague distress and indicates suicidal thoughts.

Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""partially planning to die"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""want to justify dying"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are detailed; only a vague reference to ""methods"" exists.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No clear signs, such as acquiring means or writing a note; ""partially planning"" is mentioned but not elaborated.
   - Since this is uncertain and not explicit, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing thoughts (e.g., ""for the past few months,"" ""thinking about it most of the time""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, fitting 'ideation'. There is no specific plan or preparation, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'. No past attempts are described, ruling out 'attempt'. It is not vague enough to be 'indicator' due to explicit mentions.

   - Key elements in this post include the user's recent job loss, feelings of instability, isolation from living alone after an abusive relationship, financial and educational pressures, and overall hopelessness. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""better off dead"" and a detailed description of a plan to end their life. Emotional indicators include despair, worthlessness, and exhaustion with life. Specific plans or methods mentioned: driving to the mountains, hiking off paths, and hanging themselves. There are no references to past suicide attempts, though past struggles are noted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""end it"" and ""hang myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""better off dead"" and ""no reason to keep going.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging is specified as the method, along with details like driving to the mountains and hiking to a spot.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are indications of planning, such as choosing a location and outlining steps, which suggests more than just thoughts.
   - Since a specific plan is described, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions, as the user describes ongoing thoughts and a potential plan. There are references to past events (e.g., abusive ex, childhood fears), but the suicide-related content is focused on the present and future.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (method and location), which meets the criteria for 'behavior.' It goes beyond vague ideation by detailing how the user might act, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct expressions of wanting to die (""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""I don't enjoy anything,"" ""I am lonely,"" ""I am not healing,"" ""It is terrible""), and mentions of seeking help (""I am seeking therapy and taking antidepressants""). There are no mentions of suicide explicitly, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore."" Although not explicitly stating ""suicide,"" these are clear expressions of a desire to end one's life, which aligns with suicidal thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore""), which fits the definition of Ideation as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. There is no explicit plan or preparation, so it does not qualify as Behavior. It is not Indicator because of the direct expressions of wanting to die, and it is not Attempt as no past actions are described.

Its so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on when I dont even know what else to try at this point. I'm just tired of all of it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of ongoing frustration, exhaustion, and hopelessness despite efforts to improve mental health (e.g., working out, sleeping, eating well, therapy, medication, journaling).

Emotional indicators include despair, lack of hope, and tiredness. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""unbelievably suicidal."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user describes being ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts,"" which indicates a desire to not be alive. This is clear and not vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and ongoing experiences (""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"" for years), not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (e.g., being ""unbelievably suicidal""), which fits the definition of Ideation. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as Behavior. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and it is not Attempt as there are no descriptions of past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post discusses the user's need for therapy due to depression and anxiety, describing themselves as ""fucked up"" and lacking motivation to get up. Key elements include emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as general dissatisfaction with life and fear of judgment from parents. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The content focuses on mental health struggles without any explicit reference to suicide, so I lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clearly absent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., needing therapy now and lack of motivation), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness related to depression and anxiety, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide or desires to die. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator' as it lacks any explicit suicidal content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and a ""new suicide method"" inspired by a video about using eye drops to kill. Emotional indicators include expressions of trying to suppress these thoughts, not wanting to act on them, sighing, and wishing they weren't like this, which suggest distress and hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods in the sense of personal preparation, or references to past attempts; it's more about ideas triggered by external content.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post directly references ""suicidal thoughts"" and a ""suicide method."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the acknowledgment of suicidal thoughts, though the user expresses a desire not to act on them.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post mentions an idea inspired by a video (using eye drops), which could be seen as a specific method. However, there are no signs of preparation, such as acquiring means or taking steps toward action. Since it's uncertain if this constitutes an explicit plan (it's described as just an ""idea""), I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current thoughts and feelings, such as ongoing suicidal thoughts and a recent idea from a video. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, fitting the definition of 'ideation,' as there is a desire related to not wanting to live but no clear evidence of a specific plan or preparations. Although a method is mentioned, it's not accompanied by indications of intent to act, so 'ideation' is the best fit rather than 'behavior.'

I realized the date when I was going through my screenshots and found the note, primed and ready to be posted on social media so nobody wonders why I stopped responding to calls or going to work. Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include references to writing a suicide note, planning a time and place for suicide, feelings of calmness associated with the plan, self-sabotage of the plan, and current thoughts of coaxing back that feeling to possibly follow through. There are mentions of death and suicide through the note and implied actions. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, frustration, and despair about being the cause of one's problems. Specific plans or preparations are noted, such as writing the note and selecting a time and place. There are references to a past event where the plan was made but not executed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to the suicide note and the overall context of planning to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied in the note, the planning, and phrases like ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly (no tools or substances detailed), but preparations like writing a note, picking a time and place are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the suicide note and planning indicate preparation in the past, with hints of current intent.
   - Since there is mention of a plan, even if from the past with current undertones, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (a month ago, writing the note and planning), but also current or future intentions (coaxing the feeling back and possibly acting on it this time). No actual past attempt is confirmed, as the plan was sabotaged.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress, with explicit mentions of suicide and a plan (suicide note, time, and place), so it's not 'indicator'.
   - It includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a described plan, which aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.
   - It's not 'attempt' because no concrete past action (like an overdose) occurred; the plan was prepared but not executed, though current plans are hinted at.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' fits best due to the combination of explicit thoughts and mentioned planning.

I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay.

As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of suffering from an abusive household, feelings of loneliness, PTSD, anxiety, health problems, and a general sense of hopelessness. The user mentions feeling like a ""stain upon the world,"" that the world wouldn't change if they were gone, and they are ""hanging on by threads."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, loneliness, and pain, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there are implied feelings of worthlessness (e.g., ""the world would not change if I were gone""), these are not direct or explicit. Since it's unclear and not very explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no mention of any plans, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., abusive childhood) and current feelings of pain and loneliness, but there are no references to past attempts or current/future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because there is no explicit expression concerning suicide, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including ""slit my wrist,"" ""get into my broken car,"" and ""hang myself from a tree.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die) and specific plans with methods and a timeline, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts,"" desires for death (e.g., ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and pointlessness (e.g., questioning the purpose of life, feeling empty after activities). There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the post begins with ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" and includes direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), such as wishing for eternal sleep and stating it would be better to be dead.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are mentioned. The content focuses on thoughts and feelings without any explicit planning, so it aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current thoughts and feelings, not past events or attempts. It discusses ongoing suicidal ideation without indicating any historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method.

It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's search for a hotline that won't track them or involve the police. They mention a past experience where calling a hotline led to police intervention and a 3-day stay in a psych ward, which they say made them ""10x more suicidal."" There are mentions of suicide through the phrase ""more suicidal,"" indicating emotional distress, worry, and paranoia. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are described. There are no references to past suicide attempts, only to a past hospitalization.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""it made me 10x more suicidal."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the statement about increased suicidal feelings. Since this is explicit enough, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or any plans, so this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to a past event (the psych ward stay) but focuses on current feelings of paranoia and suicidal thoughts. It does not describe a past suicide attempt, only the consequences of seeking help.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""more suicidal""), but there is no mention of a specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves desires related to suicide without planning. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past attempt is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of dissatisfaction (""This is not right"") and a direct statement of not wanting to live (""I dont want to live anymore""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, as the user expresses a desire to not continue living. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""I dont want to live anymore"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive. Although it's not explicitly ""suicide,"" it qualifies as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts. Since this is clear but leans toward ideation, I'll note the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but here it's sufficiently direct.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any plans, so this does not indicate behavior. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but there's no uncertainty here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions (""I dont want to live anymore""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive (""I dont want to live anymore""), which fits the definition of Ideation (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). It goes beyond general dissatisfaction, as seen in Indicator, but lacks any plan or preparation for Behavior. There's no mention of past attempts, so Attempt doesn't apply. Based on the analysis, Ideation is the best fit.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to being ""suicidal,"" the idea of ""ending it silently,"" and expressions of emotional distress such as frustration, hopelessness, and anger. There are mentions of death (e.g., ""until I die"") and the user's struggle with seeking help while being accused of attention-seeking. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, and there are no direct references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned through the word ""suicidal"" and the phrase ""ended it silently."" There are indirect expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""until I die""), which suggest suicidal thoughts. Since these are explicit references, this leans away from 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, or signs of preparation are mentioned. The post discusses general suicidal concepts but lacks any details on how to carry out an action, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""suicidal"" and related ideas), indicating a desire related to not wanting to live, but without any specific plan or method. This best fits 'Ideation' based on the definitions.

Im sad to say this might be my final good bye. ill miss my family they've always taken care of me but there's only so much to be done.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of loneliness, tiredness, hopelessness, and explicit mentions of suicide such as ""i feel like killing my self every day"" and preparations like ""suicide note, bills, testament."" Emotional indicators show despair and a sense of giving up. There are no mentions of specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) but clear signs of preparation. No references to past suicide attempts are present; instead, it refers to past efforts in life and previous posts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""i feel like killing my self every day"" and ""suicide note.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indicated by ""i feel like killing my self every day"" and ""this might be my final good bye.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (e.g., no tools or locations), but there are signs of preparation such as ""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done."" This qualifies as preparations for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, explicitly stated.
   - Since preparations are mentioned, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""this might be my final good bye""), not past events. No past attempts are described; it's about ongoing thoughts and readiness.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions preparations (suicide note, etc.), which align with the 'Behavior' category as it includes explicit planning. It is not just ideation because of the preparations, and there are no past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt.' It's more than general distress, so not 'Indicator.'

222,"I'm holding it all in and i'm about to explode. I feel like I can't keep it to myself anymore or else i'm going to kms. I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting. I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog. I haven't talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks i'm ok. I'm not though. I don't know what to do anymore. I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kms"" multiple times, which means ""kill myself,"" indicating suicide. It also includes self-harm references like ""I can't stop cutting."" Emotional indicators include feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and despair, such as ""I'm holding it all in and I'm about to explode,"" ""I'm not ok,"" and ""I don't know what to do anymore."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for suicide beyond the general intent. No references to past suicide attempts are present, though ongoing self-harm is noted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes – Terms like ""kms"" and ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"" directly reference suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes – Phrases like ""I'm about to kms"" and ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"" express a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No – While self-harm (""cutting"") is mentioned, it is not described as a specific method for suicide, and no tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No – There are no indications of preparations like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this aligns more with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions, such as ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"" and ""I'm about to kms, just not yet."" There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, only ongoing issues like self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and desires to die (e.g., ""kms""), which goes beyond general distress, so it is not 'indicator.'
   - It lacks any specific plan or method for suicide, making it 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it is not 'attempt.'
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation.'

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of wanting to kill oneself, references to a suicide note that was written and discarded, desires to shoot oneself, and expressions of anger and hopelessness towards family interventions. Emotional indicators include deep resentment, feelings of burden, and a desire for revenge through suicide. Specific plans or methods mentioned: ""shoot myself on the spot"" (method: shooting) and the existence of a suicide note (preparation). References to past events: Writing and discarding a suicide note, but no description of an actual past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself,"" ""suicide notes,"" ""shoot myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., desires to end life as revenge and explicit statements of intent).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""shoot myself on the spot"" indicates a method involving a gun).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., writing a suicide note, which was found and discarded, counts as preparation).
   - Since specific methods and preparations are present, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (writing the suicide note, family intervention) and current/future intentions (increased desire to kill oneself now). No concrete past attempts are described, only preparations.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post goes beyond general distress or vague thoughts, with explicit suicidal expressions, a specific method (shooting), and preparations (suicide note). This fits 'behavior' as it includes explicit thoughts plus a plan/preparations. It's not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'ideation' due to the presence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past concrete action is detailed.

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of overdose (OD), specific prescription drugs (venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh, and inderal), and explicit thoughts of suicide. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""I can't feel anything right now and it's all I can think about."" There are specific plans mentioned, like intending to take all the drugs at once. No references to past attempts are present; it's focused on current thoughts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post states ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""Think I'm going to OD today"" and ""hope for the best"" indicate a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details overdosing on specific drugs (venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh, and inderal) by ""popping all of them at once.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions having a month's prescription, implying access to the means, and planning to act today.
   - Since a specific method is clearly described, this fits planning rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions, as indicated by ""Think I'm going to OD today"" and ongoing thoughts (""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (overdosing on named drugs), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of methods and preparations. There are no past attempts described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. 'Indicator' is not suitable as suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and exhaustion (""I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up""), regret and apologies (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt"" and ""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person""), gratitude (""thank you to those who brought any light into my life""), and a farewell message (""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson""). There is a vague reference to ""The end is the only thing that feels right now,"" which could imply death or ending life, but it does not explicitly mention suicide, self-harm, death, dying, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" is vague and not a clear statement of suicidal intent. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No, such as tools, locations, substances, or notes. Since there is no indication of a plan, this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and emotions, with no mention of past events or future intentions. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and a vague sense of ""the end,"" but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of extreme distress, including being suicidal and depressed. It mentions emotional indicators like feeling terrible, overwhelmed, and unable to cry. There is a specific method referenced: ""cutting my god damn throat."" No references to past attempts are present.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: Yes, the user explicitly states ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" and expresses a desire to ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through words like ""feel so bad,"" ""terrible terrible,"" and ""incredibly overwhelmed.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method is mentioned (cutting the throat), but no signs of preparations like acquiring tools or writing a note.
   - References to past attempts: None explicitly described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user says ""I was already suicidal and depressed.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat,"" indicating a desire to end life.
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cutting my god damn throat"" refers to a specific method of self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as notes or acquiring means.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation,' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, as indicated by phrases like ""I feel so bad"" and ""all I want to do is,"" with no reference to past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat""), which meets the criteria for 'behavior.' It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a plan, even briefly, so 'behavior' is the best fit. If there were no specific method, it might be 'ideation,' but the guidelines specify to classify as 'behavior' when methods are present.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicide"" explicitly in the first sentence and quotes a phrase about ""want to kill yourself,"" which references suicide. There are no mentions of death, dying, self-harm, or specific plans/methods. Emotional indicators like hopelessness are present in the quoted phrase (e.g., ""it doesn't matter""), but these are attributed to the quote, not the user. No references to past attempts or preparations.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used, and the quote includes ""want to kill yourself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, these expressions are in the quote and not presented as the user's own thoughts or feelings. The user is simply sharing and inquiring about the quote, so it's not a personal expression. Since it's unclear if this constitutes the user's explicit suicidal thoughts, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there's no indication of planning, and if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but this doesn't apply here as there's no personal suicidal content.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a recent discovery of a quote (past event in terms of finding it), but it doesn't describe any personal past attempts, current thoughts, or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post discusses a quote about suicide but does not express the user's own suicidal thoughts, desires, or feelings. It lacks any personal explicit expressions of wanting to die, plans, or behaviors. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no direct indications of the user's suicidal risk, even though suicide is mentioned in a third-party context. The rules emphasize that the risk applies only to the person writing the post, and here, it's not personalized. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die, such as ""i want to leave earth,"" ""wanting to die,"" and ""i'm ready to join my dog."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""i'm not happy anymore,"" ""i've never been truly happy,"" ""i give up on everything,"" and ""my life will never get better."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as in ""wanting to die."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (Yes), such as ""i want to leave earth"" and ""i'm ready to join my dog.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no signs of preparation. Since there is no explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions, such as ongoing feelings of wanting to die, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""wanting to die""), but there is no specific plan or method mentioned. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' best, as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's grandfather passing away, the user's previous decision to kill themselves before Christmas, their current decision not to due to the impact on their mother, reflections on gaining appreciation for life, and emotional insights from witnessing grief. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""I was going to kill myself""), emotional indicators of past despair and current relief, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I was going to kill myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, in the past tense. Since it's explicit, this clearly indicates suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed. It's a general expression of intent without specifics, so this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to past intentions (decision to kill themselves before Christmas) and current reflections, but not to any past attempts or ongoing plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill themselves), but without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of ""Ideation"" as it involves desires to end one's life without details of how.

I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of suicidal thoughts, family conflicts, feelings of unfair treatment, social anxiety, and seasonal depression. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""think about suicide,"" ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" and ""want to commit suicide."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, anger, and self-doubt (e.g., feeling like faking depression). Specific methods are referenced through research on ""easy painless ways to kill myself,"" but there are no clear signs of preparations like acquiring tools or writing a note. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""thoughts about suicide"" and ""want to commit suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself."" This is clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user mentions researching ""easy painless ways to kill myself,"" which indicates specific ideas about methods. Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations like acquiring means are described. However, the presence of specific ideas about ways to commit suicide aligns with the definition that pushes this toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to recent past events (e.g., thoughts in February) and current intentions (e.g., ongoing triggers and research). There are no descriptions of past attempts, only thoughts and feelings.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, and it mentions specific ideas about methods (researching ways), which per the definitions qualifies as 'behavior.' It goes beyond vague ideation by including details on how to commit suicide, even if no actual preparations are confirmed. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses dissatisfaction with life (""Life is useless""), idealizes a state after death (""something better on the other side... without thought or human Emotions""), and advocates for normalizing death and suicide (""Death and suicide need to be normalized""). There are mentions of death and suicide, indicating emotional distress and hopelessness, but no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly states ""Death and suicide need to be normalized.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? There are indirect expressions through phrases like ""Life is useless"" and describing a preferable state after death, which implies a desire for non-existence, but it's not a personal, direct statement like ""I want to die."" Given the instruction to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, this is noted as potentially ambiguous.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but since no plan is present, it doesn't qualify for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It appears to be general thoughts about life and death, without specifying past events or future personal intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post mentions suicide explicitly, expresses hopelessness, and implies a preference for death, which aligns with 'Ideation' as it involves explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire for a state without life). However, there is no specific plan, so it's not 'Behavior.' It's not purely 'Indicator' because suicide is directly mentioned, making it more than just general distress. Given the definitions, this fits 'Ideation' as the best category, though if extremely doubtful, 'Indicator' could be considered—ultimately, the explicit mention tips toward 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""the thought of death"" and describes it as beautiful, with phrases like ""to never feel pain anymore,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""to be nothing in a black sea of infinity,"" and ""to let go after holding on so tight."" These indicate a romanticized view of death and emotional indicators of despair or hopelessness, such as a desire to escape pain. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there are vague expressions about death and not feeling pain, which imply a desire for non-existence. Since this is not explicit and leans toward vague feelings, I must choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, there's no indication of planning at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or general thoughts about death, not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses vague feelings about death and a desire to escape pain, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to end one's life. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it involves general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, the rules specify choosing 'Indicator' over 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of emotional distress such as hopelessness, isolation, and despair (e.g., ""i'm so fucking tired,"" ""my will to live is hanging by a thread,"" ""all my life I just wanted to feel like I belong""). There are explicit mentions of suicide and death (e.g., ""I'll kill myself,"" ""use any method I can,"" ""not afraid of death anymore""). Emotional indicators show deep hopelessness and a desire to end life. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools or locations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I'll kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""my will to live is hanging by a thread,"" ""I don't think I can hold onto it any longer"").
   - The mentions are clear, so this leans toward a category beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are detailed; only a general statement like ""use any method I can"" is made, which is vague.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit or specific plan, I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., actions based on COVID results), not past events.
   - No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or preparation, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of specific methods, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" multiple times, describes taking an entire bottle of zopiclone as a failed attempt, expresses feelings of failure, being a burden, and disappointment, and seeks help. There are clear mentions of suicide and self-harm (e.g., attempting to overdose), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, a specific method (zopiclone), and a reference to a past attempt.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""kill myself and stop being a burden.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, taking an entire bottle of zopiclone is described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of taking the bottle implies preparation for a suicide attempt.
   - Since a concrete action is described, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event (taking zopiclone and it not working) and current intentions (asking what to do to kill themselves), indicating both historical action and ongoing thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (overdose on zopiclone), which fits the ""Attempt"" category. Additionally, it mentions current suicidal desires, and per the rules, posts referring to past attempts should be labeled as ""Attempt"" even if current plans are also present.

There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I might kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as it expresses a possible desire to end one's life.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and experiences (e.g., ongoing struggles), with the suicide mention implying a potential future intention (""I might""), rather than past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""I might kill myself""), indicating a desire to end one's life, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of Ideation, as there are no details of preparation or behavior.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""Goodbye,"" ""end it tonight,"" ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes""), explicit references to suicide (e.g., ""end it""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., struggling with depression for a long time).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end it tonight"" and ""I will be non existent."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as indicated by ""Goodbye world"" and the intent to end existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including taking whole bottles of Tylenol and Advil (substances for overdose). There are signs of preparation, as the post specifies the action will happen ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes."" This clearly indicates explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""going to end it tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) and a specific plan with methods (overdosing on pills), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the detailed plan, and it's not about past actions, so 'Attempt' doesn't apply. There's no ambiguity here, as the criteria for 'Behavior' are met.

Emotional indicators include physical discomfort, misery, and frustration about not remembering past events. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts; it's focused on current distress related to forgotten past misery.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through expressions of misery and inability to cope with memory loss.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit references; only vague mention of being miserable last year.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past events (last year's misery) but the suicidal expression (""i want to kill myself"") seems current, triggered by the discomfort of not remembering.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only general past misery is mentioned, not any attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to kill oneself) but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation'.

Now im sure that life is sending me the message that I should die. I'm not deserving of love or even fun. And life is right. I deserve to die and suffer while doing so. And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of death and suicide, such as ""kill myself,"" ""end myself,"" ""I should die,"" and ""I deserve to die."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, like ""everything is shit,"" ""I'm not deserving of love or even fun,"" and ""life is sending me the message that I should die."" There are references to a specific plan to commit suicide on the birthday in two weeks, and a mention of a past failed attempt in October. No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I deserve to die and suffer while doing so"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are detailed beyond the general plan to ""end myself on my birthday.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as writing a note or acquiring means, are mentioned. Since it's unclear if this constitutes explicit planning, I would lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if not for other factors.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""first failed attempt in October"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a plan, but the key factor is the reference to a past attempt combined with current plans. According to the definitions, if a post mentions past attempts and also current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt,' even though it might otherwise lean toward 'behavior' or 'ideation.'

Thanks to all of you that helped me survive to this moment.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a celebration of one month since the user's last suicide attempt, the absence of current suicidal thoughts, occasional thoughts about death without intent to act, a positive shift in mood due to personal realizations, and references to past depression. There are mentions of a past suicide attempt, but no current expressions of self-harm, plans, or methods. Emotional indicators show a shift from past hopelessness to current positivity.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user explicitly mentions their ""last suicide attempt."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user states that suicidal thoughts are gone and they feel good.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. The post does not indicate any current or past plans beyond the reference to a previous attempt.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to past events (the suicide attempt one month ago and two years of depression) and current positive feelings. There are no references to future intentions or ongoing suicidal behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt, which aligns with the ""Attempt"" category as it focuses on historic actions. There are no current suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors mentioned, so it does not fit ""Ideation"" or ""Behavior."" It is not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned in the context of a past event.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""awful thoughts"" is mentioned, it's not specified as suicidal. Since it's unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool.

My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-hatred, and despair (e.g., ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I fucking hate myself,"" worries about wasting time, body image issues, and social isolation). There are references to self-harm thoughts (e.g., ""imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself""), but no specific plans or methods. No references to past suicide attempts, though past hospitalization for depression is mentioned.

   - Emotional indicators: Yes (hopelessness, anger, self-loathing).
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No specific tools, locations, or preparations are described; only imagined self-harm.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past suicide attempts, only past depression-related hospitalization.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I want to die or reverse time,"" ""I fucking hate being alive"").
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so this goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No; there are thoughts of self-harm (e.g., amputating or burning), but these are described as imaginations, not concrete plans or means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No; no mentions of acquiring tools, writing notes, or other preparations.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""I think about dying every fucking day"") and some past events (e.g., hospitalization for depression), but there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts or current future intentions with specifics.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves desires to not be alive without concrete planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional pain and physical symptoms from depression, such as ""hurt so bad emotionally,"" ""muscles ache,"" ""everything is so exhausting,"" and ""it's like my own body is giving up."" There is a mention of hoping to die, specifically ""hoping I will die in my sleep tonight,"" which indicates a desire for death. No mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations are present. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the phrase ""hoping I will die in my sleep tonight,"" which expresses a desire to die. Since this is a direct expression of wanting to die but not explicitly suicide, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since there is no indication of a plan, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and a future intention (hoping to die tonight), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to die but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It goes beyond general distress (as in Indicator) but does not involve planning (as in Behavior) or past actions (as in Attempt).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions an overdose of Zoloft (6 pills, 300mg), which is a form of self-harm. It references death by stating ""It obviously wasn't enough to kill me,"" indicating an intent to die. Emotional indicators include slight nausea and sweatiness, with concern about not going to the hospital. There are specific methods mentioned (overdose of pills) and it refers to a recent action taken.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, implied through the overdose and the phrase about not killing them.
   - Emotional indicators: Concern and physical symptoms, suggesting distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, taking 6 pills at 11:30 is a specific method and action.
   - References to past attempts: This describes a very recent past event (the overdose).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the implication of the overdose intended to kill.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, inferred from the action and statement about it not being enough to kill.
   - The content is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, Zoloft overdose with dosage details.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of taking the pills at a specific time indicates preparation and execution.
   - This goes beyond ideation, as actual behavior occurred.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (overdose at 11:30) with current effects (nausea, sweatiness), but the core is a completed action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the overdose is described as having happened.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a concrete past action (overdose), which fits the 'Attempt' category as it involves a historic action. Although there's no mention of additional current plans, the primary focus is on the past attempt, so 'Attempt' is the best fit. It doesn't qualify as 'Behavior' since that's for current plans, and it's not just thoughts (ruling out 'Ideation') or vague distress ('Indicator').

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of chronic stress, trauma, health deterioration (severe chronic fatigue syndrome), and a decision to ""do it."" There are mentions of wanting to end life implicitly through phrases like ""destined to do it,"" ""I've made my decision,"" ""it's soon,"" and ""there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of peace about an impending action. There is a vague reference to a ""plan,"" but no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are detailed. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but phrases like ""destined to do it"" and ""I've made my decision"" strongly imply a desire to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, statements such as ""there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"" express a desire not to continue living.
   - Since it's not crystal clear (e.g., no direct phrase like ""I want to kill myself""), I lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the overall context suggests explicit suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, substances, locations, or means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a mention of ""hope my plan works,"" which implies some vague plan exists, but it's not explicit or detailed (e.g., no mention of acquiring means or writing a note).
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' as the plan is not specified.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers primarily to current and future intentions, such as ""it's soon"" and ""hope my plan works,"" indicating an upcoming action rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire not to live) but lacks specific plans or methods, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It goes beyond general distress because of the implied decision and plan, but since the plan isn't detailed, it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior.' There's no mention of past attempts, so 'Attempt' doesn't apply. If in doubt about explicitness, the rules push toward 'Indicator,' but the direct expressions of wanting to die make 'Ideation' the best fit.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, there are no direct expressions like ""I want to die,"" but the mention of seeking a suicide forum implies suicidal thoughts. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans toward ideation, but I must consider the rule to choose 'indicator' if in doubt about explicitness.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post only expresses a desire to find a forum, which is not a plan or preparation for suicide. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, there's no indication of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings (ongoing hopelessness) and a future intention (wanting to find a forum), but not to past events or attempts. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness, which could initially suggest 'indicator.' However, the explicit mention of ""suicide forum"" indicates suicidal thoughts without any specific plan, fitting the definition of 'ideation.' There are no elements of planning or past attempts, so 'behavior' or 'attempt' do not apply. Given the explicit mention, I classify it as 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'

Idc if no one responds I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die even though I know it's painful idc just want an end",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme distress, low self-worth (""I'm disgusting to look at""), desperation about life circumstances (considering sex work to escape parents), and a desire for comfort that wasn't received. It directly mentions self-harm and death with phrases like ""slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. There is a specific method mentioned (""slash my wrists""), but no clear references to preparations like acquiring tools. The opening ""I tried, I guess"" is vague and could imply a past effort, but it's not explicitly a suicide attempt.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, and frustration.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, ""slash my wrists"" as a method; no explicit preparations mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: Vague with ""I tried, I guess,"" but not clearly a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""slash my wrists and die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, ""just want an end.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slash my wrists"" indicates a specific self-harm method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring means or writing a note.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior,' but as per rules, if uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; however, the method is clear enough here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It has a vague past reference (""I tried, I guess""), but the main content focuses on current intentions (""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the past reference is ambiguous and not detailed as a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""slash my wrists""), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves planning (e.g., a described method). It's not just vague ideation, and while there's a possible past hint, the focus is on current intentions, so 'attempt' doesn't fit best. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category.

That is the most bullshit phase I have ever heard. I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone. ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying through phrases like ""I cannot wait to die"" and references to funeral costs. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""my life is not able to be fixed,"" ""no-one I know has gone through the things I have,"" and dismissing ""life will get better"" as bullshit. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations beyond vaguely arranging funeral costs, which could imply preparation but isn't explicit. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with ""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone.""
   - Since there is a direct expression, it goes beyond just vague distress, so it's not 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" could suggest preparation for death, but it's not explicit (e.g., no suicide note or acquiring means). Given the uncertainty, I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""I cannot wait to die""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die, fitting 'ideation,' as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned. It exceeds 'indicator' due to the direct desire to die but does not meet 'behavior' criteria due to lack of explicit planning. Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit.

(Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent)",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as questioning the point of life if it won't improve, describing past happiness that has ended, and predicting a future of depression. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and a sense of loss, but there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post expresses general dissatisfaction with life but does not directly state a desire to end one's life. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or method, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but in this case, it doesn't even reach ideation level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future pessimism (e.g., ""i'm destined to live a depressed life""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' because there is no explicit suicidal content, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include references to jumping from a bridge in NYC to achieve death, which implies a method of suicide. There's a mention of selecting a bridge with the highest chance of death and a timeline (""by the weekend""). Emotional indicators include a sense of resignation or determination, as seen in phrases like ""wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want."" No references to past attempts or self-harm are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of jumping from a bridge to ensure death.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post seeks information on the most lethal bridge and indicates intent to proceed.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, jumping from a bridge is specified, with consideration for which one in NYC offers the highest chance of death (specific locations as means).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post mentions deciding on a bridge by the weekend, indicating a timeline and decision-making process.
   - Since this involves explicit planning, it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as the post discusses upcoming actions (e.g., picking a bridge by the weekend). No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (wanting to die via jumping) and a specific plan (selecting a bridge with a timeline), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of a method, nor 'Ideation' because of the plan, nor 'Attempt' as it's not about past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and feeling misunderstood by parents, a sense of isolation and lack of support, self-doubt about personal efforts, and a belief in perpetual suffering and pain as one's destiny. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as feeling like an ""alien"" meant to suffer and questioning if this is deserved. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post includes vague feelings about never being free or dying, but these do not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to end one's life. Following the guidelines, when unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning or means related to suicide, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and frustrations, with no mention of past events or future intentions related to suicide. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of death and suicide, such as the user's sister's suicide and her past attempts, as well as the user's own ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses hopelessness, pain, doubt, and a desire for a ""welcome end to everything,"" along with thoughts that death (e.g., sleep lasting forever) is appealing.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned for the user.
   - References to past attempts: The user explicitly describes their own aborted suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through references to the sister's suicide and the user's past attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, with phrases like ""it would be a welcome end to everything"" and ""the idea of that state lasting forever is hard to turn away from.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances for the user.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, none are indicated.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events (sister's suicide and user's own past attempt) and current/future intentions (ongoing thoughts of wanting an end, but not as immediate plans).
   - Past attempts are specifically described, particularly the user's aborted attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt by the user, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it involves a concrete action in the past (e.g., an aborted attempt qualifies as a historic action). Although current suicidal thoughts are present, the explicit description of the past attempt makes 'Attempt' the best fit, per the definition that prioritizes historic actions. It does not qualify as 'Ideation' alone because of the past attempt detail, and there's no current plan for 'Behavior.'

I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, and emotional numbness (e.g., ""There's no hope anymore. There's no joy anymore. There's no emotion anymore. The pain is numb now""). There are mentions of suicide implied through phrases like ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess,"" which suggests self-harm or suicide. Emotional indicators show deep distress and a sense of futility. Specific plans are mentioned (location: tub, to reduce mess), but no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""I plan on doing it,"" which in context clearly refers to ending one's life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the post conveys a desire to end the suffering.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as using the tub to minimize mess, which implies a method like drowning or self-injury in water. There are signs of preparation in the planning aspect. Since this involves a specific plan, it goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I plan on doing it""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (method and location), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not just ideation because of the explicit plan mentioned.

Emotional indicators show distress or sadness, such as wanting relief from pain, but nothing explicitly indicating hopelessness or despair tied to ending life. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a general desire for pain relief, which is vague and not explicitly linked to suicide, so I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there's no indication of any plan, this doesn't qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings (wanting a hug now to alleviate pain), not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator' as it involves sadness without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of wanting to end it, which directly relates to suicide and dying. Emotional indicators are prominent, such as hopelessness, despair, loneliness, trauma, body dysmorphia, anorexia, and addiction. The post describes a history of mental health issues like epilepsy, selective mutism, and self-harm behaviors (e.g., taking painkillers leading to addiction and physical harm). There are no explicit specific plans or methods for suicide mentioned, but past self-harm through substance abuse and starvation is referenced. No clear preparations for suicide are noted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""wanting to end it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through phrases indicating a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No clear specific methods for a suicide plan are detailed; past substance abuse (e.g., painkillers) is mentioned but not as part of a current plan. No signs of preparation like acquiring tools or writing notes are present. Since there's uncertainty about an explicit plan, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers mostly to past events (e.g., childhood traumas, past self-harm) but includes current intentions (e.g., ""wanting to end it""). No specific past suicide attempts are explicitly described, though self-harm behaviors are implied.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to end it) without a specific plan, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to lack of a clear plan, and not 'Attempt' as no concrete past suicide attempt is detailed.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, explicitly states ""I really want to fucking kill myself,"" describes a plan involving train tracks, and mentions ""cutting myself again.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, anger towards parents, and feelings of loss.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I really want to fucking kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, including desires to end their life.
   - The mentions are clear and direct, so this goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, describes using train tracks at a nearby station as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly (e.g., no mention of notes or acquiring means), but the description of the plan is detailed enough to indicate a specific method.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It references past suicidal thoughts and self-harm but focuses on current feelings and a future plan (e.g., ""I'm thinking about running away"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No concrete past attempts are detailed, only implied through references to overcoming thoughts and self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (train station and tracks), which fits the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond ideation because of the mentioned method, and it's not solely about past events, so 'attempt' doesn't apply.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no explicit current plan is present, this leans toward 'ideation' or 'attempt' based on other factors, but not 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past attempts (historic) and current desires to die, but no specific future plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, as concrete actions that occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. While there are current suicidal thoughts (which could suggest 'Ideation'), the presence of described past attempts makes 'Attempt' the best fit. There are no current plans mentioned, so it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior'. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions.

257,"Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real. Nothing in my life feels real. I think it's all a dream. A dream we are all so desperately attached too. Nothing about it feels real. Unless I'm trying to kill myself. Then, I feel guilty for my family. I feel the pain of trying to end my own life. I feel anger of not being able to get over my own survival instincts. I feel shame for failing. I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off. I'm not sure exactly when, I think tommorow maybe. But I don't know. I have plenty of opportunities. Maybe tommorow, maybe next week, maybe next month, maybe next year. Who tf knows. Idk, not that anybody cares or is going to read this. I can't blame anybody for not reading anyway. I'm such a fucking loser. And all the people who've abandoned me, lied to me, got sick of me have proven that time and time again.

Or even if they do now, they won't eventually. Fuck me",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of trying to kill oneself, feelings of unreality in life, guilt towards family, emotional pain from previous attempts, anger at survival instincts, shame for failing, and plans to try again. There are clear references to death and suicide (e.g., ""trying to kill myself,"" ""end my own life""), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, guilt, and anger, as well as hints of a past attempt (""shame for failing""). Specific plans are mentioned, such as using a ""different method"" that is easier and involves calculations (""my math is off""), with a vague timeline (e.g., ""tomorrow maybe"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""trying to kill myself,"" ""end my own life""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., desire to try again and end life).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., a ""different method"" that is easier and involves calculations, implying something like a drug overdose). Are there signs of preparation? Indirectly, through references to the method and timing, though not fully detailed. Since there is mention of a method, this leans toward planning, but I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain—however, the context suggests explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., ""shame for failing,"" implying a previous attempt) and current/future intentions (e.g., planning to try again soon, possibly tomorrow).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a plan (e.g., different method, timing), which could suggest 'behavior'. However, it also describes a past attempt (""shame for failing"") and mentions current plans. According to the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts but also includes current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, such as ""A day feels like a month,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""Nothing to do,"" ""Reminded every second of others successes,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""No money will rot your brain,"" and ""It's over."" There are mentions of wanting to ""end it,"" which implies a reference to death or suicide, but no explicit details on self-harm, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include despair, isolation, and mental pain, with no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" expresses a desire to end one's life, which is a veiled but clear indication of suicidal thoughts. Since this is not entirely unclear, it leans toward being an explicit expression of suicidal feelings.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and intentions, as seen in phrases like ""All I want is courage to end it,"" which is in the present tense. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to ""end it""), fitting the definition of Ideation, as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It is not Indicator because of the direct indication of wanting to die, not Behavior due to the absence of any plan, and not Attempt as it does not describe a past action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The user mentions a specific date and time (April 13, 2021, at 13:14 hours), references their birth at that time 18 years ago, and expresses intent to ""go out of this world"" at the same time. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I'm offing myself then"" and ""Goodbye world."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm not worth living""). No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I'm offing myself then.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I'm not worth living"" and ""Goodbye world.""
   - The language is clear and explicit, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or ways to carry out the act.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post specifies a date and time, which could imply intent, but it does not describe any concrete preparations like writing a note or acquiring means. Since there is no explicit method or preparation, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure, this leans toward ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions (on April 13, 2021), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan involving methods or preparations. This fits 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without the details required for 'Behavior.' If there were a method mentioned, it might shift to 'Behavior,' but per the rules, I am choosing 'Ideation' due to uncertainty on explicit planning.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which rules out 'indicator.' There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.'

There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but there are no specific plans, methods, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the post implies a vague sense of wanting to stop existing, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or means, so if there were any uncertainty, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's absent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as feeling lost, alone, hated by family, self-hatred, and a sense of being a burden. There are mentions of death and dying indirectly through phrases like ""I would have done it already,"" ""if I did it,"" and ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it,"" which imply suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a desire for non-existence. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools or locations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of self-hatred, depression, feelings of failure as a parent and individual, hopelessness about life, and a desire to end life in the future.

Emotional indicators include despair, lack of motivation, and a sense of worthlessness. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""not wanting to live,"" ""I'm suicidal,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""Why am I even here"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of ongoing struggle and emotional distress, such as ""I'm struggling to hold on,"" ""Been depressed and feeling like shit for years & years,"" and ""I just want off this life."" There are mentions of hopelessness and despair through words like ""struggling"" and ""feeling like shit."" However, there are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I just want off this life"" implies a desire to escape life, which could suggest wanting to die, but it is not a direct or explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life""). Since this is unclear and not very explicit, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since nothing indicates a plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post expresses general dissatisfaction with life and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include phrases like ""By this time next week I'll be gone,"" which implies death or absence, and expressions of hopelessness such as ""There's no possible way to turn my life around anymore,"" ""No point in trying anymore,"" ""My own body has given up on itself,"" ""I'm just so tired of fighting this constantly,"" and ""It's a cycle that I can't escape."" There are emotional indicators of despair and depression, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" implies a desire to not be alive, though it's not explicit in using words like ""suicide"" or ""die."" Since it's somewhat unclear but leans toward indicating suicidal thoughts, I must consider the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt; however, this phrase suggests a stronger expression of not wanting to live.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates steps like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since there's no evidence of a plan, if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions (""By this time next week I'll be gone""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses hopelessness and a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""I'll be gone""), which aligns with explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan, fitting the definition of 'Ideation.' It goes beyond general dissatisfaction because of the implied desire to end one's life, even if not using explicit terms. It's not 'Indicator' as there's a clear expression of wanting to be gone, not just vague distress. It's not 'Behavior' due to the absence of any plan, and not 'Attempt' as there's no reference to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""another attempt,"" which implies a previous suicide attempt. It also includes expressions of wanting to die (""I just want to die"") and not surviving (""I hope I don't make it""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as the user expresses frustration with their parents and a desire to avoid further interaction. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to self-harm beyond the implied past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""another attempt"" strongly implies it. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, with phrases like ""I just want to die"" and ""I don't want to survive another attempt."" Since this is direct, it goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is indicated. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this doesn't apply here as no plan elements are present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past attempt (""another attempt"") while expressing current desires (""I hope I don't make it"" and ""I just want to die""). This combines historic reference with present feelings.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post describes a past attempt, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. Additionally, it mentions current desires, and per the rules, if a post refers to past attempts and also implies current intentions (even without explicit plans), it should be labeled 'Attempt'. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit expressions of wanting to die, not 'Ideation' alone since a past attempt is referenced, and not 'Behavior' as no specific plan is mentioned.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include reflections on past suicidal behaviors, specifically two events where the user engaged in actions related to suicide. There are mentions of death and dying, such as ""intention of dying"" and ""testing my method"" until nearly the point of no return. Emotional indicators include ongoing distress, struggle with categorization, and feelings of being bothered by these memories. Specific plans or methods are vaguely referenced (e.g., ""testing my method""), but not detailed. There are clear references to past attempts, describing actions taken in the past.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user discusses ""suicide attempt"" and describes intentions to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, in the second event, they state they went in with the intention of dying.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, indirectly through ""testing my method"" and going to the brink. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, as they describe preparing and executing a test. Since this involves past actions with some form of method testing, it goes beyond mere ideation, but I must consider the context of past events.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to past events, with both described incidents happening ""long enough ago."" It focuses on historical actions rather than current or future intentions, though there's ongoing emotional reflection.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past actions that constitute attempts, such as going through with a method up to the point of no return with the intention to die in one case. This aligns with the 'Attempt' category, which is for content describing past suicidal actions where concrete steps were taken. There's no indication of current plans, so it's not 'Behavior.' It's more than just thoughts, so not 'Ideation' or 'Indicator.'

270,"Why exactly should I even have hope anymore? Its evident from my entire life up until now that I was never meant to be happy. I have to learn to not get my hopes up or get excited over shit. Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, despair, and a desire to die, such as ""I really want to die"" and ""I'd rather die than submit to anyone."" There are emotional indicators like ongoing frustration, anger about past traumas (e.g., bullying, beatings by parents), and general dissatisfaction with life, relationships, and existence. No mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are present. There are references to past events like childhood abuse and bullying, but no references to past suicide attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I really want to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I'd rather die than submit to anyone."" This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond vague feelings.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items. Since there's no indication of a plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., childhood bullying and family abuse) but focuses on current feelings of hopelessness and a desire to die, which seem present-oriented. No past suicide attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' since no past attempts are detailed.

Specific methods are referenced (jumping in front of a car, stabbing oneself), and there's an indication of preparation (""looking up how to do it""). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""contamplating suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""i wish i had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself so this nightmare could all be over"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., jumping in front of a car, stabbing oneself).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., ""looking up how to do it"").
   - This indicates explicit planning, so it aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific methods (e.g., jumping or stabbing), which meet the criteria for 'behavior.' It goes beyond vague ideation by mentioning ways to commit suicide, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape life, such as ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" and ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all."" There are mentions of death indirectly through the wish for a nuclear bomb, and emotional indicators like despair, anger, distrust, and feelings of failure. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are references to past relationship issues (e.g., the ex leaving), but no references to past suicide attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" and ""I want to leave and never come back"" directly express a desire not to be alive. Although not using the exact term ""suicide,"" these are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts. If unclear, I should lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation,' but here the desire to not be alive is clear enough to qualify as explicit under the Ideation definition.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations like writing a note or acquiring means. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as Behavior. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current feelings and frustrations (e.g., ""I'm so fucking done with this shit""), with some references to past events like the ex leaving. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts; it's focused on present desires.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (e.g., wanting to leave and never come back), which fits the Ideation category as it involves suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction (which would be Indicator) because of the direct statements about not wanting to live. There are no plans or past attempts, so Behavior or Attempt do not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct mentions of death and dying (""I want to die,"" ""It will all be done after I die""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and distress due to racial pressure (""I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color""), and a specific method implied (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""). There are no references to self-harm beyond this or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""I want to die"" directly expresses a desire to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die"" and the implication in ""pull the trigger.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pull the trigger"" refers to using a gun as a method. Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, such as acquiring a weapon or writing a note, but the mention of a method qualifies as part of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I want to die"") and mentions a specific method (""pull the trigger""), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category as it involves both ideation and an explicit plan or method. According to the definitions, if a specific idea of how to commit suicide is present, it should be classified as 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"" and ""my forearms with my wounds""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness""), and a reference to death as an escape (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and it references a past self-harm event.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free,"" which implies a desire for death.
   - Since it's not explicitly worded as suicide, but leans toward indicating suicidal thoughts, I would note this as an indicator of ideation; however, the past event must be considered separately.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates current planning.
   - Since there's no evidence of explicit planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to a past event (""I hurt myself two months ago""), which is a concrete action, and current feelings of despair and a desire for death. There are no future intentions described, but the past attempt is a key element.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a past self-harm action (""I hurt myself two months ago""), which qualifies as a past attempt at suicide based on the definition requiring a concrete action. Although there are current expressions of wanting to die, which suggest ideation, the presence of a described past attempt takes precedence per the category definitions. Therefore, the best fit is 'Attempt.'

I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, sadness, and ongoing suicidal thoughts. There are explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I think about suicide every day,"" and ""seriously consider it once a week."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, fear of hospitalization, and a desire for help. Specific plans are referenced with ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" and ""long conversations with myself about suicide."" There are no references to past attempts or methods like tools or locations, but the plans suggest some level of detail.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in phrases like ""the more suicidal I get"" and ""seriously consider it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? The post refers to ""detailed plans in my journal,"" which implies specific ideas or methods are being written, even if not explicitly detailed here. This could indicate planning, as it involves documenting suicide-related thoughts. Signs of preparation are present through journaling, which aligns with explicit planning. Since specific ideas are mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing experiences, such as daily thoughts and weekly considerations, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions detailed plans in a journal, which qualifies as explicit planning (e.g., specific methods or ideas). This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it goes beyond mere ideation by including elements of preparation. If there were any doubt, the guidelines specify to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here the evidence supports 'behavior.'

There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as the language suggests overwhelming emotional or physical suffering. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""I cant take it anymore"" implies severe distress, it does not explicitly state a desire to end one's life. Since this is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so if it were to be considered for a higher category, it wouldn't qualify, and I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if needed, but it's not.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings of pain and inability to cope, with no reference to past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or a plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., capability of committing suicide) but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though phrases like ""I just want it to be over"" suggest vague dissatisfaction, it does not explicitly state a desire to end one's life.

I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable.

Emotional indicators are prominent, including hopelessness, despair, loneliness, physical pain, and anxiety. Specific plans or methods are discussed, like the details of using a handgun (e.g., caliber and shooting through the upper palate) and overdosing, with references to real examples like Mark Linkous. There are no clear references to past attempts, focusing instead on current thoughts and fears.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, including shotguns, handguns with details on caliber and technique, and overdosing.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is evidence of research or consideration of methods, which suggests some level of planning, though not explicit actions like acquiring tools.
   - Since specific methods are clearly described, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'

It includes explicit expressions of suicidal desires along with specific methods (e.g., handgun details, overdosing), which aligns with the 'behavior' category as it involves explicit planning. It does not qualify as 'attempt' since no past actions are described, and it's more than just 'ideation' due to the specificity of methods mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and exhaustion (""Can't do any of it!""), dissatisfaction (""Just don't want this anymore""), and a desire to escape permanently (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up""). There are indirect mentions of death through the phrase ""sleep and never ever wake up,"" which implies a wish to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive, as it metaphorically indicates wanting to die without waking. Although not using explicit terms like ""kill myself,"" this is a clear indicator of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out the desire. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and intentions, as the language is in the present tense (e.g., ""don't want this anymore,"" ""wanna sleep""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, which aligns with the definition of Ideation (suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). It is not Indicator, as there is a direct expression of wanting to die, even if indirectly phrased. It is not Behavior, due to the absence of any plan or method. It is not Attempt, as no past actions are described.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out? I want to be done, I want to be out of this and I wish I could just sleep for now but I can't. I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of extreme tiredness, ongoing struggles with depression, shame from past decisions, isolation, unemployment, family concerns, lack of appetite and sleep issues, and identity-related challenges as a Black trans man. There are direct mentions of ""ideations of suicide,"" feelings of wishing not to be alive, and a sense of hopelessness and worthlessness. Emotional indicators include despair, shame, loneliness, and a battle to stay alive. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly states ""ideations of suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive"" and ""Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it"" indicate a desire to not be alive.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., daily struggles and ideations), with mentions of past life events like mistakes and relationships, but not past suicide attempts. It's focused on present intentions rather than historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and desires to not be alive, which disqualifies it from 'indicator.' There is no specific plan or preparation, so it's not 'behavior.' It's not 'attempt' as there are no descriptions of past suicide actions. Therefore, it best fits 'ideation,' as it involves explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme loneliness, lack of friends, self-doubt, and emotional pain. There is a mention of ""thinking about killing myself,"" which directly references suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and the statement ""I can't take this anymore.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""thinking about killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as it implies a desire to end one's life due to loneliness. Since this is explicit, it goes beyond just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Therefore, this does not qualify as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and thoughts, such as ongoing loneliness and present suicidal thoughts, rather than past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""thinking about killing myself""), which fits the definition of Ideation. There is no specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as Behavior. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and it is not Attempt as there are no descriptions of past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include a metaphor of being strapped in a car with no brakes, traveling at high speed with weak lights, and not knowing the destination. This represents feelings of anxiety, sadness, and a pointless situation. The user expresses a desire for this to stop by crashing into another car, mentioning they frequently come close to doing it but refrain due to fear of not dying and experiencing prolonged pain.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There are indirect references to death through the idea of crashing to end the situation, implying a desire to die, but no explicit use of words like ""suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, anxiety, and sadness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method is mentioned—crashing into another car—as a way to stop the feelings, and the user notes coming close to doing it, but no actual preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are described.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned; this appears to be about current thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly, as the user wants to crash to end their anxiety and sadness, expressing a desire for death.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While not fully explicit, the desire is tied to a method, so it's more than vague; however, I must consider the rules carefully.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, crashing into another car is specified as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only thoughts of coming close to the act are described, without evidence of actual preparations.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is a specific idea of a method (crashing), which per the definitions pushes this toward 'behavior', as the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts with a mentioned method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and ongoing thoughts (""I frequently come close to doing it""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post goes beyond general distress because it includes explicit expressions of wanting to die and mentions a specific method (crashing), which aligns with 'behavior'. It's not 'indicator' due to the presence of suicidal thoughts with a method. It's not 'ideation' because a specific plan element (method) is described, per the rule that specific ideas of how to commit suicide classify as 'behavior'. It's not 'attempt' as no past actions are referenced.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, abandonment by a friend, abuse from job and parents, and an explicit statement ""I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when."" There are mentions of death and suicide, emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, with the phrase ""I'm going to kill myself.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are described. Since there is no explicit plan, this aligns with choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and future intentions, not past events or attempts.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death as an option and questioning whether such thoughts are considered suicidal. There are emotional indicators of passive acceptance of death (e.g., ""it's not the worst outcome""), but no explicit despair, hopelessness, or general dissatisfaction with life. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned. The user explicitly states, ""I won't commit,"" indicating no intent to act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post directly references ""suicidal thought"" in the question. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Indirectly, through the idea that death via accident isn't the worst outcome, but the user denies any intent to commit. Since it's explicitly mentioned, this leans toward ideation, but I must consider the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post only discusses a hypothetical accident, which is not self-inflicted. There are no signs of preparation. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's clearly no plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current thoughts rather than past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., questioning if thinking death is an option counts as suicidal), indicating a desire to not be alive in a vague sense, but without any specific plan. This fits 'Ideation' as per the definition, which requires explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan. However, given the rule to choose 'indicator' if in doubt about explicitness, I note the direct mention of ""suicidal thought"" makes it explicit enough for 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of intent to end one's life (""finally kill me""), a sense of urgency and timing (""Tonight is the last chance""), references to long-term planning (""Its been a year since i planned this""), and indications of preparation (""I even have the stuff prepared and everything""). There are emotional indicators of regret and resolve (""I wish i didnt have to do this, but im doing the right after all""). Mentions of death and suicide are present, with signs of specific preparations, but no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""kill me"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the post clearly conveys an intent to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? The post refers to ""the stuff prepared,"" which implies means or tools for suicide, though not detailed. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, with mentions of planning for a year and having items ready. Since preparations are indicated, this goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions (""Tonight is the last chance""), with a history of planning but no description of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of a desire to die, along with clear indications of planning and preparation (e.g., ""the stuff prepared""). This aligns with the 'Behavior' category, as it involves both suicidal ideation and explicit plans or preparations. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, 'Ideation' because of the added planning element, or 'Attempt' since no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of self-hatred (""I hate my body,"" ""I look like I'm 12""), a direct mention of suicide (""kill myself""), and a plan involving self-starvation (""I've decided to stop eating all together and starve myself""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"" and ""I see no reason to fuel it with energy."" No references to past attempts are present, but there is a specific method mentioned (starvation) and a desire for death.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as stopping eating to starve oneself, which is a form of self-harm intended to lead to death. There are no explicit signs of further preparations like notes or tools, but the decision to starve is presented as a plan. Since a method is specified, this leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user states ""I've decided to stop eating,"" indicating an ongoing plan rather than past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself"" and hoping for death) and mentions a specific plan (starvation as a method). This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it combines suicidal ideation with an explicit plan. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, 'Ideation' because of the plan, or 'Attempt' since no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of ongoing distress, sadness, loneliness, past hardships, confusion, and terror. There are emotional indicators such as hopelessness and a vague sense of not always wishing to be gone, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is vague and not a direct expression, so I lean toward 'No'. Since it's unclear, I follow the rule to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plan, so if it were to be classified beyond 'indicator', it wouldn't qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers mainly to past events (hardships survived) and current feelings (loneliness), with no references to future intentions or past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts. Based on the definitions, this fits best as 'Indicator', as suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and in cases of doubt, 'indicator' is preferred.

295,"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it. Nothing is happening and I don't believe my environment facilitates forward moment. Therefore it is probably best I head out before it gets worse. If nothing changes, the fuck am I getting up in the morning for?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life,"" and ""Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like ""Nothing is happening in my life,"" ""I just feel stagnant,"" and ""My body is destroyed constantly."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""take my own life,"" ""end myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""whether it would be best to end myself,"" ""it is probably best I head out"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No (no details on tools, locations, or substances).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No (no mentions of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations).
   - Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and potential future intentions (e.g., ""Recently, I've been thinking about..."" and ""if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions self-harm (""I just slit my wrists""), death (""my death will only benefit people,"" ""I won't have much time to live,"" ""Goodbye""), and suicide through descriptions of intent and actions. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I have been so distant,"" ""I am not a good person,"" ""it took me years to decide this""), despair, and a desire to end life. Specific plans and methods are detailed, such as looking at pictures of the radial artery, marking it, using a dremel with a saw attachment, and performing the act. There are no direct references to past attempts beyond the current description.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""my death will only benefit people,"" ""I just want to get it over with,"" and the description of self-harm leading to death.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, evident in the intent to end life and the statement ""if you are seeing this then it's already too late.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, including slitting wrists, targeting the radial artery with a dremel and saw attachment.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, such as researching artery locations, marking the area, and typing the post beforehand.
   - Since explicit planning is present, this leans toward 'behavior' or 'attempt,' but I must evaluate further based on timing.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a current or very recent event (""I just slit my wrists,"" ""I typed this out before and will post it once I have done it,"" ""if you are seeing this then it's already too late""), indicating an action that has just occurred. It describes a concrete past action in the context of the post, qualifying as an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes a concrete action that has happened (slitting wrists), which fits 'Attempt' as it involves a past attempt. It also includes elements of planning, but the key is the description of the action taken. This aligns with 'Attempt' per the definitions, especially since it refers to a historic action in the post's timeline.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself. Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of the user's friend being suicidal and the user admitting to being suicidal themselves. There are emotional indicators such as feelings of hypocrisy, not wanting to keep going, and internal struggle, which suggest hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned by the user. There are no references to past attempts by the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states, ""I'm suicidal myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I don't want to keep going myself."" This is clear and not vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of any plan or method, and the instructions say to choose 'ideation' if uncertain, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions, as the user discusses their ongoing state (""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I'm starting to find it hard""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., admitting to being suicidal and not wanting to continue), which fits the definition of Ideation. There is no specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as Behavior. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and it is not Attempt as no past actions are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself""), indicating suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method. This fits the 'Ideation' category, as it expresses a desire related to not wanting to live further in a conditional context, but lacks details on execution. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, 'Behavior' due to no plan, or 'Attempt' due to no past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of gender dysphoria (""I'm a man, that's feels like a woman, but could never be a woman""), feelings of being a ""broken human being"" and a ""prison,"" causing pain to others, and overall despair.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I'm better off dead"" and ""Can't stand this anymore,"" which express a desire to not be alive.
   - Since there is a direct expression of wanting to die, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as it's not just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward carrying out a plan.
   - Since no plan is mentioned, this fits ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""Can't stand this anymore""), with no reference to past events or attempts. It's focused on the present state of mind.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I'm better off dead""), which aligns with the definition of ideation as it involves a desire to not be alive without any specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to past suicidal thoughts, such as setting a date to end one's life, writing letters, and having a set plan. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""set plan""). Emotional indicators include past despair and hopelessness, contrasted with current hope and decision to live. Specific preparations are noted (writing letters and having a set plan), but no explicit methods or tools are detailed. There are references to past near-attempts without confirming an actual action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killing myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, in the past tense (e.g., coming close to killing oneself).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly (no tools or substances named), but there are signs of preparation (writing letters and having a set plan). This indicates explicit planning, so it goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers primarily to past events (e.g., setting a date, writing letters, being days away from the plan), with no current or future intentions mentioned. It describes a near-attempt but not a completed one.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific plan (e.g., set plan and preparations), which aligns with 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses regret for not having ""done it"" years ago, which implies suicide. It includes wishes of not being alive, wanting things to be over since 2012, and ongoing anger about not acting on those thoughts. Emotional indicators include regret, anger, hopelessness, and a desire to have ended life earlier. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations, and no references to actual past attempts—only past thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) The word ""suicide"" is not used, but phrases like ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" and ""done it"" directly indicate a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) Yes, with clear statements of wishing not to be alive and regretting not acting on those wishes.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is clear enough as expressions of wanting to die are present, so it leans toward ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) No tools, locations, substances, or any details about how to carry out suicide are mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) Nothing indicates preparations like writing a note or acquiring means.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? (No) It mentions past thoughts but not actual attempts; it's about not acting on ideas.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wishing not to be alive) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress, as there's a clear desire to die, but lacks the elements of planning required for 'Behavior' or a past attempt for 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, and killing oneself. The user expresses depression, suicidal feelings, and an internal conflict about administrative tasks. Specific preparations mentioned: writing a suicide note that details what to give to people. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. There are no mentions of specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or self-harm beyond the note. References to past actions: The user states they have already written a note, indicating past preparation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user says ""I'm depressed and suicidal"" and ""killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""wanting to die"" and ""get ready to die"" are used.
   - This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions writing a suicide note and thinking about canceling things, which qualifies as preparation under the definition (e.g., suicide note is listed as an example).
   - Since preparations are explicitly mentioned, this suggests 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.' However, if unsure, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but the note is a clear indicator of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (writing the note) and current/future intentions (ongoing thoughts of killing oneself but hesitating). There are no descriptions of actual past attempts, only preparations.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions of preparations (e.g., writing a suicide note), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the explicit planning element. It's not 'attempt' because no actual past suicide attempt is described, just past preparations. It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions.

Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? It implies a desire related to suicidal thoughts but does not explicitly say ""I want to die."" Since the term ""suicidal"" is used, this qualifies as an explicit mention.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any plans. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (the trespassing yesterday) and current feelings (being more suicidal now), focusing on the present state of mind rather than future intentions or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts through the phrase ""I've never been more suicidal,"" which fits the definition of ideation as it expresses a desire related to not wanting to live without any specific plan or method. There is no indication of planning (ruling out behavior) or past attempts (ruling out attempt). It is not merely general distress without explicit suicide mention, so it is not indicator.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses historical and societal themes without any personal suicidal thoughts, so I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of any plan, this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current societal issues and historical events (e.g., Hitler), but there are no references to past events related to the poster or current/future intentions involving suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness about life and society but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator', as there are no explicit suicidal expressions.

Its seems so terrifying. I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, rejection, and emotional pain, such as ""Everybody in my life... just dislike or are indifferent to me,"" ""I feel so alone,"" and ""It just hurts so much."" There are mentions of death and dying, specifically ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, like feeling unloved and terrified about the future. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I just want to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I just want to die and go to Heaven."" This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just general distress.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future fears (e.g., going to college), but it does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation,' as it involves wanting to end one's life without detailing how. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

311,"I want to help my suicidal online friend who has been through literal hell but I don't know how and I'm scared. I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks. Sorry for the post that is all over the place I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user's concern for their friend who has experienced suicide attempts, abuse, mental health issues (e.g., depression, BPD, bipolar, insomnia, eating disorders), and vivid descriptions of the friend's suffering. The user expresses their own fear, confusion, and emotional distress about helping. There are mentions of death and suicide related to the friend (e.g., multiple attempts, dreams of hanging), but for the user, there is a direct statement: ""I'm suicidal myself."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and the user's breakdown, but no specific plans or methods are described for the user. References to past attempts are present but only for the friend.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, for the user, as they state ""I'm suicidal myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, for the user, through the phrase ""I'm suicidal myself,"" indicating a desire related to not wanting to live.
   - Since this is explicit for the user, it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, for the user; the post does not describe any tools, locations, or preparations related to the user's own suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing is mentioned for the user.
   - Since there are no indications of a plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? For the user, it refers to current feelings (""I'm suicidal myself""), with no mention of past attempts or future plans.
   - Past attempts are described, but only for the friend, not the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post focuses on the user's own statement of being suicidal, which is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of ""Ideation,"" as it involves desires related to not wanting to live but lacks details of planning. The risk is evaluated only for the person writing the post, so the friend's experiences are not considered. Based on the rules, this is not ""Indicator"" due to the explicit mention, not ""Behavior"" due to no plan, and not ""Attempt"" due to no past actions described for the user.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct pleas like ""Just kill me,"" ""end my life,"" and ""end my pain."" These indicate a desire for death and express emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""kill me"" and ""end my life,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die. (Yes to both questions.)

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current intentions or feelings, not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) but lacks any specific plan or method, making it a clear fit for 'Ideation.'

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to end their own life based on a utilitarian perspective, discussions of anger issues affecting relationships and self-directed harm, feelings of hopelessness, and a cry for help. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself""). Emotional indicators include despair, self-directed anger, and belief that their existence causes more pain. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are references to past anger-related behaviors but no past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as they discuss the logic of ending their life and question if it's the right decision.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. This is purely about thoughts and feelings without concrete planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events like anger issues hurting relationships, but the suicidal thoughts are current or future-oriented. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation' as defined. There is no evidence of planning or past attempts, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' does not apply. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, it is not 'Indicator'.

Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme exhaustion, persistent negative thoughts, unhappiness with the world, and a sense of everything being a chore or pressure. There are mentions of not wanting to continue (""I don't want it anymore"") and a desire for options to ""end it all."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life. There is a reference to a gun as a potential method that would ""solve everything,"" but it's tied to the user's location in the UK where it's inaccessible. No mentions of self-harm, specific preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) - The word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are expressions implying a desire to end life, such as ""I don't want it anymore"" and ""end it all if we don't want to be here.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) - Phrases like not wanting to be here and seeking ways to end it indicate suicidal thoughts, though not with the exact words.
   - Since it's somewhat unclear if this is fully explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the rules, but the overall context suggests suicidal ideation due to the desire expressed.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (Yes) - A gun is mentioned as a method that would ""solve everything,"" but it's presented as unattainable and not as an active plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) - No indications of acquiring means, writing notes, or taking steps toward action.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.' Here, while a method is referenced hypothetically, there's no evidence of a concrete plan, so I classify it as ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? (Current/future) - The post focuses on ongoing feelings and frustrations, with no reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not be alive and end it all) but lacks a specific plan or preparations. According to the definitions, this fits 'Ideation' because it involves suicidal feelings without concrete planning. Even though a method (gun) is mentioned, it's not in the context of an explicit plan, so I choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' as instructed when unsure.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

The user discusses family issues, mental health struggles, and daily life, but there are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""I wish I could die""). This qualifies as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts.

I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support.

I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to self-harm (cutting), past incidents of cutting, emotional distress such as feeling numb, empty, and hopeless, accusations from others about faking it, and mentions of scars. There are no direct mentions of death, dying, or suicide, but self-harm is described as a way to relieve pain. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"") and despair from social rejection. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for future actions are mentioned. There are references to past attempts, specifically a self-harm incident a few months ago where the user cut themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" suggests vague hopelessness. Since this is not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, past cutting is described, but only in the context of a previous event, not current or future plans. Are there signs of preparation? No. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's no indication of any planning, so it doesn't qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to past events, such as the self-harm incident a few months ago. There are no clear current or future intentions mentioned, though the vague statement about wondering if it's worth it could imply present distress. Past attempts are specifically described (e.g., cutting to relieve pain).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete past action of self-harm (cutting), which aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' as it involves historic actions that could be considered a suicide attempt. Although suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the description of the past incident qualifies as a past attempt. There are no current plans, so it fits 'Attempt' rather than 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'. If it were only vague distress, it might be 'Indicator', but the past concrete action takes precedence.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through references to suicidal thoughts, even if not phrased as a direct desire to die. Since it's explicit, this clearly indicates beyond just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. The user expresses a preference to go to the hospital instead of acting, but without detailing any plan, so this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and potential future intentions (e.g., considering the hospital), not past events. No specific past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., suicidal ideation) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are detailed.

320,"I hope I die soon. I have started to do heroin pretty much daily. Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead""), ongoing self-harm behavior through daily heroin use, emotional indicators of hopelessness, anger, and despair (e.g., ""Fuck that,"" ""it just kills me inside,"" ""They will pay for how they made me feel""), and references to past negative experiences with antipsychotics. There are mentions of death and dying, but no explicit suicide term. No specific plans or methods for suicide are detailed beyond the heroin use, which is described as current behavior rather than a deliberate suicide method. No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead,"" which indicate a desire to not be alive.
   - Since there are direct expressions of wanting to die, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator,' as per the instructions to choose 'indicator' only if not explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Heroin use is mentioned as daily behavior, which could be a risky substance, but it's not explicitly linked to a suicide plan (e.g., no details on dosage for overdose or intent to use it for that purpose). No other tools, locations, or preparations are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as writing a note or acquiring means specifically for suicide.
   - Since there's no clear specific plan or method for suicide, and the instructions state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this fits 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""Soon I will be finally dead""), with a mention of a past negative experience with antipsychotics, but no description of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of wanting to die, fitting the definition of 'ideation' (desire to not be alive without a specific plan). It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to the direct expressions of wanting to die. There is no explicit plan or preparation, so it does not meet 'behavior.' No past attempts are described, so it is not 'attempt.'

321,"What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem. I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a question about the best position of a gun to hit the brain stem, which implies a method for self-inflicted death. There are mentions of death indirectly through the reference to targeting the brain stem, and emotional indicators of indifference to life-affirming reasons (e.g., family, regrets), suggesting hopelessness. Specific plans or methods are referenced, as the user is inquiring about a precise way to use a gun. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the user does not directly say ""suicide"" or ""I want to die,"" but they express a clear intent related to ending their life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, but the context strongly implies it. Since it's unclear if suicide is explicitly mentioned, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines, but the overall context must be weighed.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as the position of a gun to hit the brain stem, which is a tool and a precise way to end life. There are no clear signs of preparation like acquiring means, but the inquiry about a method indicates planning. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the specific method described tips it toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is asking for information now, not describing past events. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes expressions of suicidal thoughts (through indifference and method inquiry) and specifically mentions a plan (gun position for brain stem), which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves a method. It goes beyond vague ideation due to the explicit planning element, so 'behavior' fits best.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of ""killing myself,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself,"" ""it wont leave my head,"" and ""everything just keeps getting worse."" Additionally, references to self-harm scars suggest past self-injurious behavior. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past suicide attempts, only to self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post describes constant thoughts of killing themselves.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so this moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing notes is indicated.
   - Since no plan is present, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This primarily refers to current and ongoing thoughts (""hasn't been a single day,"" ""it wont leave my head""), with a mention of past self-harm (scars seen by the mother). However, the self-harm is not described as a suicide attempt, so it doesn't shift to 'attempt.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill themselves) but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past suicide attempt is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme frustration and hopelessness, such as ""I don't know what the fuck to do anymore,"" ""I still feel like trash,"" and ""I'm sick of life."" There are direct mentions of suicide and killing oneself (""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself"" and ""Let's just do it""). Emotional indicators show despair and a desire to end life, but there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself"" and ""Let's just do it."" This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned?

My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better.

My body has lost the fight and my mind has won. Goodbye.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I'm going to attempt again,"" ""I've tried to overdose three times,"" and ""I want to die."" Emotional indicators show deep hopelessness and despair, like ""I'm just so tired. Not even sleep can fix this type of tired,"" self-hatred (""I hate every little thing about myself""), and giving up (""I give up fighting for a body that I don't want to live in anymore""). There are references to specific methods (overdose) and past attempts (""I've tried to overdose three times"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year""). Additionally, there's an indication of future intention with ""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""attempt again,"" ""I want to die,"" and references to past overdoses. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I want to die"" and ""my mind has won"" in the context of ending life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, overdose is specified as a method from past attempts and implied for the future. Are there signs of preparation? The post indicates an imminent plan with ""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again,"" suggesting a timeline, but no explicit details like acquiring means. Since there is a clear mention of a plan, this aligns with 'behavior' criteria, but I must consider the overall context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., ""I've tried to overdose three times"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year"") as well as current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to attempt again"" in a few hours). This combines historical actions with prospective plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a plan (""going to attempt again""), which initially suggests 'Behavior.' However, it also describes past attempts (e.g., overdoses), and per the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'Attempt.' Therefore, the best fit is 'Attempt' based on the rule for combined past and current elements.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of personal struggles such as family issues, loss of a friend, parental problems, isolation, and alcoholism. There are mentions of emotional pain, hopelessness, and a desire for the pain to end, but no direct references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair and exhaustion (e.g., ""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore"" and ""I just want this pain to end""). No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""I just want this pain to end"" implies distress, it is vague and not a direct expression of suicidal thoughts. Since it is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plan, so if it were to be considered further, it would not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings of pain and past events (e.g., the friend's drowning), but not to future intentions or past suicide attempts. It is focused on ongoing distress without indicating any timeline for action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and vague distress but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of being suicidal, expressions of hopelessness and despair (e.g., not thinking they'll make it past this summer, frustration with the mother's reaction), and a vague statement about it being time to ""fucking go."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states ""I'm suicidal."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"" indicate a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no explicit plan is present, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society.

I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of death, dying, and suicide (e.g., ""I should have killed myself,"" ""hanging is painless,"" ""I tried but it didn't work,"" and plans to ""buy the right stuff"" and ""be gone after this weekend""). Emotional indicators show extreme hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, and depression (e.g., ""I cant take it anymore,"" ""I'm drowning in depression""). Specific plans or methods are referenced, such as hanging and acquiring means. References to past attempts are present (e.g., ""I tried. I tried. But it didn't work"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., hanging, buying the right stuff).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., saying goodbyes, planning to act after this weekend).
   - Since there are explicit plans, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., past attempts: ""I tried but it didn't work"") and current/future intentions (e.g., plans to act soon).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, a specific plan (method and preparations), and references to past attempts. According to the definitions, since it mentions past attempts and also current plans, it fits the 'attempt' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct statement about planning to kill themselves at a specific age (25 or 30), expressions of hopelessness (""It's not worth it""), gratitude and farewell sentiments (""I'm sorry to the people I know in advance"" and references to another life), and uncertainty about the future (""I still have a long time to rethink my decisions""). There are no mentions of death or dying outside of suicide, no specific methods (like tools or substances), no signs of preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I'm planning on killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through statements like ""Adios I can't. It's not worth it"" and implying a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No, only a vague timeline (age 25 or 30) is referenced, without any concrete actions like writing a note or acquiring means. Since this lacks explicit planning details, it leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves desires to end life without concrete details.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The phrase ""teetering on the edge lately"" suggests emotional instability or being on the brink, possibly metaphorically related to mental health. There's a mention of the suicide rate for men being four times higher than for women, which is a factual reference but not personal. Emotional indicators include distress about being perceived as a threat due to gender identity, implying general dissatisfaction and empathy for others, but no direct expressions of hopelessness, despair, death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post references suicide rates statistically but not in a personal context. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, ""teetering on the edge"" is vague and metaphorical, not a clear indication of suicidal thoughts. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but there's no basis for either here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current state (""lately""), but there's no indication of future intentions or past attempts; it's more reflective.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post shows general distress and awareness of suicide statistics but lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, plans, or past attempts. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it involves expressions of dissatisfaction without direct suicide references. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is preferred.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of ""suicide"" in the mom's statement, an implied reference to the user's own potential death with ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours,"" emotional indicators of sarcasm, bitterness, and sadness (e.g., ""Thanks mom,"" farewell message, and emoticon "":(""), and well-wishes to others indicating a possible goodbye. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned in the mom's quote. There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, as ""I'm gone within 24 hours"" implies the user might end their life, which counts as an explicit indicator in context. Since this is not unclear, it leans toward ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are mentioned. There are no signs of preparation. Since there's no explicit plan, this fits ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""within 24 hours""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., implying the user might be gone soon), indicating a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include descriptions of childhood abuse by parents, current living situation with them, dismissal by authorities, emotional manipulation, self-hate, threats to safety and possibly life, feeling forced to stay silent, and a desire for a restraining order without proof. There are mentions of emotional distress, such as ""it's killing me,"" which could metaphorically indicate severe pain, but no direct references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-hate, and feeling trapped, but no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses a relapse into self-harm after four months of abstinence, triggered by old issues and panic attacks. It mentions emotional distress, promises to stop self-harm, and explicit thoughts of suicide. There are mentions of death and suicide (""before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now and save time""), emotional indicators like hopelessness and frustration, current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now""), and references to past self-harm attempts.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, explicitly with phrases like ""before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, and frustration are evident in the relapse and broken promises.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) are mentioned, but current self-harm is described, and there's an implication of escalating to suicide.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, implied through the four months without self-harm, indicating prior self-harm behavior.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct phrases like ""before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as seen in the intent to ""kill myself"" and end it immediately.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no details on tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations, but current self-harm is occurring, and the language suggests immediate action.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no clear plan, but the post exhibits self-harming behavior, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category definition.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past self-harm (four months without), current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now""), and future intentions (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, past self-harm is referenced, but not as a full suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and exhibits self-harming behavior (""I'm bloodying myself up now""). The 'Behavior' category requires explicit suicidal thoughts plus a plan or self-harming behavior. Although no specific plan is detailed, the presence of ongoing self-harm qualifies it under 'Behavior' per the definition. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, 'Ideation' because of the self-harming behavior, or 'Attempt' as it's not solely about past actions.

I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to die, such as ""someone blow my head off,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" and ""please kill me."" These directly reference death and a violent method. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, with phrases like ""im fucking done"" and ""im tired of these stupidass ignorant people."" There are no mentions of specific preparations or past attempts, but ""blow my head off"" implies a method (e.g., shooting). Self-harm is indirectly suggested through the desire for someone to kill the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the user doesn't use the word ""suicide,"" but there are direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""i fucking deserve death,"" ""please kill me""). This leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts rather than vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my head off"" suggests a method involving a gun or similar tool. There are no signs of preparation like acquiring means. Since a specific method is referenced, this indicates more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and feelings, not past events. There are no references to past attempts; it's focused on the present desire.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""blow my head off""), which aligns with the definition of ""Behavior"" as it involves a plan or method. It's not just ideation because of the method reference, and it's not an attempt since no past action is described. Therefore, ""Behavior"" is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to end life, such as ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life right now,"" which imply suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness about the future, anxiety regarding graduation, and despair over financial and familial issues. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life right now,"" which directly express a desire to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed. Since there are no signs of explicit planning, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ending life to avoid future problems), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses deep feelings of failure in various life roles, hopelessness, self-hatred, isolation, and substance use. There are mentions of death and suicide, including ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and a specific description of taking muscle relaxers and pain killers yesterday with the hope of not waking up. Emotional indicators include despair, inability to face others, and self-loathing. Specific methods are mentioned (taking pills), and there are references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and describing the act of taking pills to not wake up.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, explicitly stated as ""I want to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details taking ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills indicates an action was taken, though it's described as a past event.
   - Since this involves a concrete action, it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events, specifically attempts in the last 4 days and yesterday, with ongoing emotional distress but no new future plans explicitly outlined.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes concrete past actions (e.g., overdose attempts), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. It focuses on historic actions rather than just thoughts or plans, making 'Attempt' the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of dissatisfaction with life, comparisons to others, societal inequalities, personal struggles with family, culture, relationships, bullying, and a sense of hopelessness due to external factors like luck and societal structures. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and frustration, but nothing explicitly tied to suicidal thoughts. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses life as a ""curse"" and general unhappiness, but this is vague and not explicit. Since it's unclear and not direct, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events like bullying and family issues, but these are not related to suicide attempts. There are no references to current or future intentions regarding suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans.

No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""feeling suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" and ""the only escape is suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post expresses that suicide is the only escape from the situation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about acquiring means or writing notes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, such as jumping in front of a train and knowing the train schedule. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions living close to the tracks and having tried before but backing out. Since there is explicit planning, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events, including previous attempts where the user backed out or had 911 called. It also discusses current and future intentions, such as wanting to overcome fear to follow through with the plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (e.g., ""the first time I actually attempted"") and also mentions current plans (e.g., knowing the train schedule).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, isolation, bullying, family rejection, and suicidal thoughts. There are mentions of death (e.g., ""most people want me dead""), emotional indicators like feeling unloved and alone, and explicit references to suicide and self-harm (e.g., ""I can kill myself on graduation night"" and ""stick some knives through my stomach""). No specific preparations are detailed, but a method and timeline are mentioned. There are no references to past suicide attempts, only past bullying and emotional pain.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I can kill myself on graduation night"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I don't have much to live for"" and ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""stick some knives through my stomach"" as a method).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but a timeline is implied (graduation night), which suggests planning. Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., on graduation night), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress or vague thoughts, with explicit suicidal expressions and a specific method/timeline, fitting the 'behavior' category as it includes both suicidal thoughts and a plan (method and time). It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'ideation' due to the presence of a plan, or 'attempt' as there are no past actions described.

There are clear mentions of suicide and self-harm preparations. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, as seen in phrases like ""It doesn't seem to exist, not for me anyway"" and ""I can't anymore."" Specific plans and methods are referenced (e.g., tall bridges, multiple methods), and preparations are noted (e.g., drafting suicide notes). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with words like ""commit"" in the context of suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements implying an end to their life and inability to continue.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, such as researching tall bridges and referring to ""a few methods to try."" Are there signs of preparation? Yes, including drafting suicide notes. This goes beyond vague thoughts, indicating explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to recent actions (researching over the past few days) and future intentions (committing suicide after the holiday). It does not describe past attempts but focuses on current preparations and future plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, along with specific plans and preparations (e.g., methods, locations, and suicide notes). This aligns with the 'Behavior' category, as it involves both suicidal ideation and explicit planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include multiple mentions of death, dying, and suicide, such as ""end it all,"" ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't,"" and ""end it."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and relief, like ""I don't have anyone worth staying alive for anymore"" and ""This is a weight off my chest."" There are signs of preparation, such as ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" and ""once I'm ready to end it,"" but no specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are detailed.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, phrases like ""getting my ducks in a row"" and ""looking into my options"" suggest some form of preparation, but it's vague and not explicit (e.g., no mention of a suicide note or acquiring means). Since it's uncertain if this constitutes explicit planning, I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post primarily refers to current and future intentions, such as ""finally free to end it all"" and ""once I'm ready,"" rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, which rules out 'indicator.' It does not include specific plans or methods, so while preparation is hinted at, it's not explicit enough for 'behavior'—thus, 'ideation' is the best fit.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes – The user expresses a desire to end their life through these statements.
   - Since these are explicit, this moves beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No – There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plans.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No – Nothing indicates actions like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - As there's no explicit plan, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ongoing suicidal thoughts), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, fitting 'ideation' as there's no specific plan or method mentioned. It's not 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'behavior' due to lack of planning, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct statement of intent (""Gonna end myself soon"") and specific details about substances (""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on""). There are mentions of death and suicide through ""end myself"" and the reference to overdosing (OD), which implies self-harm. Emotional indicators include the expression of intent to die, suggesting hopelessness. Specific plans and methods are mentioned (overdose on Benadryl and Prozac), and there are signs of preparation (having the substances). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""end myself"" directly expresses a desire to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the phrase ""Gonna end myself soon.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies overdose (OD) as the method and names the substances (1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac). Are there signs of preparation? Yes, by stating they ""have"" these substances, indicating possession. Since a specific plan is described, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (""Gonna end myself soon""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and includes a specific plan (overdose method and acquired substances), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

345,"I'm Lonely. I don't know why but I'm constantly feeling alone. When I was in kinder I was always bullied and I didn't really make much friends. The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses persistent feelings of loneliness, bullying in kindergarten, lack of friends in grade school and high school, feeling like an inconvenience, and having only one close friend. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and self-doubt (e.g., feeling like a coward). Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The user references past incidents with a knife to the wrist, imagines family seeing them dead, and expresses a desire to commit suicide. There are no specific current plans or methods described beyond past thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong themes of hopelessness, isolation, and worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No current specific methods, tools, or preparations are mentioned; only past instances where the user held a knife but did not act.
   - References to past attempts: The user describes having a knife to their wrist three times but not following through, which suggests attempted self-harm that did not result in injury.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it"" and references to past knife incidents.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as imagining family seeing them dead and feeling the need to ""do it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The knife is mentioned in the context of past events, not as a current plan. No tools, locations, or substances are described for future use.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No indications of current preparations, such as writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit current plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past events (e.g., bullying, knife incidents) and current feelings (e.g., ongoing loneliness and the urge to ""do it""), but no specific future intentions are detailed.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the knife incidents are described as past actions that did not result in harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die, imagining death), but lacks any specific current plan or preparation, which rules out 'behavior'. It describes past actions with the knife, but these did not result in a completed attempt, and the post focuses on current ideation rather than solely past events. Therefore, it best fits 'ideation' as there are explicit suicidal feelings without a detailed plan. If unsure about planning, 'ideation' is chosen over 'behavior'.

I am not entirely a good person.""), a strong emotional need for love and validation (""I really need to feel loved... is there any hope of still being loved despite it?""), and a direct mention of suicide (""before I kill myself""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, as the user questions if love is possible despite their past. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, and there are no references to past suicide attempts, only to past wrongdoings.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""before I kill myself,"" which directly expresses an intent to end one's life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user implies a desire to die if they don't feel loved. Since it's explicit, I don't need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. It's a general statement about killing oneself without details. Since there's no explicit plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, but here it's clear there's no plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past events (the user's wrongdoings) but focuses on current feelings and future intentions (wanting to feel loved before suicide). There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""before I kill myself""), indicating a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without planning. It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past attempts are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, misery, pain, lack of motivation, feelings of being unwanted, and an explicit mention of ""the thought of suicide.""

The lockdown and cold winter put everything that much more true. I've never felt as alone as I did there. I was very depressed, bored and lots of anxiety. Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.

It is not 'Indicator' due to the presence of direct expressions of wanting to die. It is not 'Behavior' because no plan is evident, and it is not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds .

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child!

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (previous suicide struggle and hospitalization) and current/future intentions (e.g., joining their mother after she passes, indicating potential future suicide).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (hospitalization), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current suicidal thoughts, and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also implies current plans (even vaguely, as in ""I will be joining her""), it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. This takes precedence over 'Ideation', which would apply if there were only thoughts without a past attempt reference.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses severe emotional distress from a breakup, including feelings of hopelessness, mental exhaustion, persistent thoughts and dreams about the ex-partner, and a sense of being ""tired of living."" There are mentions of trying various coping methods like talking to others, taking Prozac, and engaging in new activities, but nothing helps. Phrases like ""waking up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" suggest vague despair and a potential end to suffering, but there are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, weakness, and pain from unreciprocated love. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""I have to stop it"" imply exhaustion and possible thoughts of ending the pain, they are vague and not direct. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, there's no indication of any plan, so it doesn't qualify for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events (the breakup 6 months ago and starting Prozac in December) but focuses on current ongoing feelings and a vague sense of future limitation with ""I don't have much time left."" No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and distress but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because it involves vague feelings of despair without explicit suicidal expressions. When in doubt about explicit mentions, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation.' There's no evidence of ideation, behavior, or past attempts, so 'Indicator' is the best category.

I used to love making shit. I used to love trying and experimenting and wasting time because it wasn't a waste to me. But capitalism and instant gratification has irreparably fucked up my brain. I don't want to anymore. It wasn't supposed to happen to me but it did. I don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have. I don't know anything anymore. I hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't. And that's life too. Is it alright to work a corporate job you're content with and live a mediocre existence? All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide and be depressed. Would've been better for me to not be here at all.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and exhaustion with daily activities like cooking, cleaning, and self-care. The user mentions losing interest in hobbies such as making art, attributing it to influences like capitalism and instant gratification. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of lost purpose, as seen in phrases like ""I don't want to anymore,"" ""I don't know where I want to go,"" and questioning the value of life. There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically ""constantly contemplate suicide"" and ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all."" No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""constantly contemplate suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all,"" which indicates a desire not to exist.
   - This is not unclear, as suicide is directly referenced, so it goes beyond mere general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and ongoing contemplation, with no mention of past events or attempts. It's focused on present despair and future uncertainty.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., contemplating suicide and wishing not to be here), which fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves a desire to not be alive without any specific plan. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of any plan or preparation. It is not 'Attempt' as there are no descriptions of past actions.

To say hey jesus or whatever I had an impossible situation can I go back?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses ongoing struggles with trauma, OCD, anhedonia, lack of friends, and abuse since age 12 or 13. The user, nearing 20, expresses doubt about life's value and questions if ""suicide is better"" as a release, implying a desire for escape from an ""impossible situation."" There are mentions of suicide and ""the release,"" indicating thoughts of death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of a wasted life. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly states ""When to know if suicide is better"" and refers to ""the release"" as potentially better. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases implying suicide as a preferable option and questioning if life is a ""bust."" This is explicit enough to move beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated. Since there's no explicit plan, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It references past trauma and current feelings of hopelessness, with a focus on present thoughts about suicide as a release. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire for release, fitting 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are detailed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to ""go sleep forever,"" which is a euphemism for death, and mentions of specific substances: 58 pieces of 100 mg seroquel, 58 pieces of viepax 150 mg, and viepax 75 mg. These could imply intent for overdose. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as seen in phrases like ""can't take this shit no more"" and ""I'm sick and tired of my shitty life."" There are no mentions of self-harm directly or references to past attempts, but the substances listed suggest potential preparation for a method.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wanna go sleep forever"" directly expresses a desire to die permanently.
   - Since the mention is not explicitly the word ""suicide,"" but the intent is clear, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the expression of wanting to die is evident.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post lists specific medications (seroquel and viepax with quantities), which could be used for an overdose, indicating a potential method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, having a large number of pills suggests possession of means, which could be preparation.
   - If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but the mention of specific substances as a way to ""go sleep forever"" indicates explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions, as the language is present tense (""I wanna go sleep forever""), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die and mentions specific methods (medications), which qualifies as explicit planning. This fits 'Behavior' as it involves suicidal thoughts plus a plan, rather than just ideation. It does not describe a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. While the suicide mention is not explicit in wording, the overall content pushes it beyond 'Indicator' or 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to die, depression, misery, hopelessness in a loveless marriage, resentment from kids, and feeling burdensome to others. There are mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive""), but no references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion.
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm beyond the general desire to die.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive"" indicate a desire to not be alive.
   - Although not explicitly ""suicide,"" these are direct expressions of suicidal thoughts, so I lean toward considering this as more than just an indicator based on the definitions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is mentioned.
   - Since there is no evidence of planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the instructions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts; it's focused on the present state of mind.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die and feelings of not wanting to be alive, which fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without any specific plan. It goes beyond general distress (which would be 'Indicator') but lacks the elements of planning required for 'Behavior' or past actions for 'Attempt'.

I want this to end but I am scared.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to past attempts at self-harm (e.g., ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work""), current possessions that could be used for self-harm (e.g., ""I have a rope""), potential locations (e.g., ""There's a building""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I hate myself so much,"" ""I want this to end but I am scared""), and expressions of intent (e.g., ""I have to do it,"" ""I should've done it a long time ago""). There are mentions of death and dying implied through these attempts and desires to end life, along with specific methods like a knife (past) and a rope (current).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or end life (e.g., ""I want this to end,"" ""I have to do it""). This leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts, as it goes beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as a knife (from past attempts) and a rope (currently possessed), along with a potential location like a building. There are signs of preparation, like having the rope but not yet checking the place. Since there is uncertainty about full preparation, I would lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if not for other factors, but the post includes explicit elements of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., multiple attempts with a knife) and current/future intentions (e.g., having a rope, considering a building, expressing the need to act). Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes past attempts at suicide, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans (e.g., rope and building), and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also includes current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. This overrides other considerations like planning, as the definition prioritizes past actions in such cases.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of depression, pain, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness. There are mentions of wanting to ""end it,"" which implies a desire related to death or suicide. Emotional indicators include despair and self-deprecation (e.g., feeling useless compared to a fly). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there is a direct expression of wanting to ""end it,"" which indicates a desire to not be alive. This leans toward an explicit suicidal thought.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. This is just a general expression of desire without details.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I feel pain and I just want to end it""), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses a clear desire to end one's life (""I just want to end it""), which qualifies as explicit suicidal thoughts under 'Ideation'. There is no specific plan or method, so it doesn't reach 'Behavior'. It's not 'Indicator' because of the direct expression of wanting to die, and it's not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions hoping not to wake up tomorrow, which implies a desire for death. It also references emotional distress like loneliness, tiredness, and potential depression from missing Christmas. There's a mention of ""attempt properly again,"" suggesting past suicide attempts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair.
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: Yes, through ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" and ""attempt properly again.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, loneliness, and tiredness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, implied by ""attempt properly again.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through references to past attempts and the desire not to wake up.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, e.g., ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow.""
   - The content clearly expresses suicidal thoughts, so it's not just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward ideation or attempt rather than behavior, but we must consider the full context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings (e.g., hoping not to wake up) and future intentions (e.g., getting depressed enough to attempt again), while also alluding to past attempts (""attempt properly again"").
   - Past attempts are specifically referenced, and the post combines this with current suicidal thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and references past attempts. According to the definitions, if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans or intentions (as in ""to attempt properly again""), it should be classified as 'attempt'. Even though no specific plan is detailed, the rule prioritizes 'attempt' when past attempts are mentioned alongside current intentions. Therefore, 'attempt' fits best.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a request for someone to harvest the user's organs, kill them, chop them up, and hide their body to ensure they are never found by family. There are clear mentions of death and dying through phrases like ""kill me,"" ""chop me up,"" and ""hide my body."" Emotional indicators include a desire to disappear permanently, suggesting hopelessness and despair. Specific plans or methods mentioned involve organ harvesting, chopping up the body, and hiding it. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user is asking to be killed and made to disappear. Since this is a direct expression of wanting to die, it goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post references methods such as harvesting organs, chopping up the body, and hiding it, which imply specific ways to end life and dispose of remains. Are there signs of preparation? No direct signs, as the user is seeking someone else to act, but the methods described qualify as explicit planning. Given the presence of specific methods, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is actively seeking someone to carry out the act. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die and mentions specific methods (e.g., chopping up and hiding the body), which align with the definition of 'behavior.' It is not merely ideation, as plans are detailed, and it is not an 'attempt' since no past action is described. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death,"" and ""I consider it,"" which relate to suicide and death. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and exhaustion, such as ""fed up,"" ""fighting down suicidal thoughts,"" ""none of it matters,"" and ""rock bottom lows."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts—only ongoing thoughts over 10 years.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the post refers to ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death."" There are direct expressions of considering suicide on some days (""I consider it""), though the user states ""I have no desire to die,"" which adds nuance. Since suicide is explicitly referenced, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. There are no signs of preparation. Since there is no explicit plan, this fits ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to ongoing and past experiences (e.g., ""going on 10 years""), but focuses on current thoughts and daily struggles rather than specific past attempts or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., fantasizing about death and considering it on some days) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not Behavior due to the absence of a plan, and not Attempt as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of severe emotional distress, such as wishing to end one's life, feelings of hopelessness, depression, emotional neglect from parents, envy of others receiving love, and an inability to seek help due to fear of parental reaction. There are mentions of death and dying through phrases like ""wish to end my life"" and ""end all this,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feeling unimportant, and envy. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""wish to end my life"" and ""end all this,"" which directly express a desire to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes. This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. The post emphasizes the inability to harm oneself, which indicates no active planning. Since there's no evidence of a plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current and ongoing feelings and struggles, with mentions of past emotional neglect, but there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts. It's focused on present intentions rather than historical events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to end one's life, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing how to act on them. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post expresses feelings of losing control, emotional distress (wanting to cry, can't breathe, want to scream), and a plea for help. There's a phrase ""I don't want to live this again,"" which suggests general dissatisfaction with a situation or experience, but it doesn't explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair through words like ""lost control"" and the overall plea for help. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""I don't want to live this again"" could imply a vague unwillingness to continue with a situation, it is not a clear or direct expression of wanting to die. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no mention of any plans, tools, or methods, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post seems to describe current feelings of distress (""I lost control,"" ""I just want to cry""), with ""I don't want to live this again"" possibly alluding to a past event, but it does not describe a past suicide attempt or future intentions explicitly.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress and sadness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. The vague phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" does not meet the threshold for 'ideation' as it is not an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts. Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' category, especially since the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions.

I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as hopelessness and despair (""It's too hard,"" ""I'm tired,"" ""it's so goddamn horrible""). There are mentions of ""my reason to die,"" which directly references wanting to die, and a suicide note (""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it""). No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances for suicide are mentioned. There are references to past events like relationship issues and a ""sickness,"" but no explicit descriptions of past self-harm or attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""my reason to die"" and the implication of a suicide note. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""my reason to die."" This goes beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the mention of leaving a suicide note indicates preparation for a potential suicide action. Since this qualifies as explicit planning, it leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., relationship issues and leaving a note) and current feelings of distress. It does not explicitly describe a past suicide attempt, but the note suggests a historical action related to suicidal intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""my reason to die"") and signs of preparation (suicide note), which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the note, and while it references the past, the overall context doesn't confirm a completed attempt without more detail. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and dying, such as ""I wanted to die,"" ""I just want to die,"" and ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, loneliness, feeling like a burden, and despair about ADHD and life circumstances. There are references to past suicidal thoughts (e.g., screaming he wanted to die in middle school) but no clear self-harm or explicit past attempts. The post also inquires about methods of suicide that avoid leaving a body, which suggests thinking about specific ways to end life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I wanted to die,"" ""I just want to die,"" and ""How do I kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, these are clear and direct.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post asks ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body,"" which implies consideration of specific ways (e.g., methods that result in disappearance or destruction of the body, such as jumping from a height into water). This goes beyond vague thoughts and touches on means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, as there's no mention of acquiring tools or writing notes, but the inquiry about methods indicates potential planning.
   - Since specific ideas of how to commit suicide are referenced, this leans toward 'behavior' per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., past suicidal thoughts in middle school) and current/future intentions (e.g., current desires to die and questions about methods). The focus is on ongoing feelings rather than solely past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and includes specific ideas about methods (e.g., ways to avoid leaving a body), which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of potential means. Although not fully detailed, the guidelines specify that if specific ideas are present, classify as 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being trapped, such as ""No point in it all,"" ""I hate being trapped in limbo,"" ""I won't get anywhere in life,"" and ""I don't really see a future for myself."" There are implied references to death or dying through phrases like ""push me over the edge,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" Emotional indicators show deep dissatisfaction and hopelessness, but there are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrases ""push me over the edge"" and ""faced with the eternal void"" suggest a desire for escape that could imply death, but they are vague and not direct. Since this is unclear and not very explicit, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since there is no indication of a plan, and if uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but the lack of explicit suicide mentions already points away from 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is""), but it does not describe past events or attempts. It focuses on ongoing distress rather than historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and vague allusions to death, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, I must choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation.' There are no elements of planning or past attempts, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' do not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a defense of people who commit suicide, suggesting they are not weak due to bottling up emotions and eventually snapping. There is a mention of ""commit suicide,"" which directly references suicide. Emotional indicators include references to painful emotions, bottling things up, and breaking down, implying despair and hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""commit suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as the post discusses people in general rather than the writer's own desires. The use of ""we've"" might suggest personal inclusion, but it's not a clear, direct expression from the writer. Since it's unclear if this indicates the writer's suicidal thoughts, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no evidence of planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to general processes that lead to suicide (e.g., bottling up emotions), but it does not specify past events, current feelings, or future intentions for the writer. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post mentions suicide explicitly, but it lacks direct expressions of the writer's own suicidal thoughts or feelings. It is a general statement about others, with possible indirect implication through ""we've,"" but not explicit enough to classify as 'ideation.' Given the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt, this fits best as 'indicator.'

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme tiredness of living, failure in college, social isolation, frustration with a friend, anxiety, depression, inability to perform daily tasks (e.g., showering, brushing teeth), and a bleak future outlook.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There is a direct mention of ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead,"" which implies a desire to not be alive. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, anxiety, and depression. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive, along with statements like ""I am so tired of having to live.""
   - Since this is a clear expression of not wanting to live, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as per the instructions to choose ideation if there's any explicit indication.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is mentioned, this does not qualify as behavior; it should be classified as ideation if suicidal thoughts are present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""in five years? Dead""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to be dead), fitting the definition of ideation, which covers desires to not be alive without a specific plan. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction, so it's not indicator. There's no plan or past attempt, so it's not behavior or attempt.

   - Key elements in the post include a mention of ""kill their self,"" which refers to suicide, and a reason like ""to end their pain."" There are emotional indicators of distress implied through the discussion of pain and the reason for suicide, but no explicit self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""kill their self.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as the post is phrased as a hypothetical question about ""someone"" rather than a direct personal statement from the poster, despite the addition of ""(Asking for a personal reason)."" Since it's not a clear, direct expression from the writer, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but in this case, there's no indication of planning at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a general or hypothetical situation rather than past events, current feelings, or future intentions specific to the poster. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post mentions suicide but does not explicitly express suicidal thoughts or feelings from the poster themselves; it's framed as a question. According to the definitions, this lacks the direct expression required for 'ideation.' When in doubt about explicit mentions, I must choose 'indicator.' Therefore, it fits best as 'indicator.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post describes being suicidal since age 10 or 11, including a past incident where the user thought about jumping into a lake to drown but didn't act on it.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, explicit references to being suicidal, thoughts of drowning, and planning suicide by train.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and depression are evident through descriptions of faking daily life and constant suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, mentions suicide by train as a method, specifies putting neck on train tracks, and plans it for their 18th birthday.
   - References to past attempts: The lake incident is described as a thought (""I thought jumping in""), not an actual attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ongoing suicidal thoughts and planning to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, suicide by train and details about train tracks.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, planning for a specific date (18th birthday) indicates preparation.
   - This clearly involves a plan, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past thoughts (lake incident) but primarily focuses on current and future intentions (daily thoughts and plan for 18th birthday).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (method and timing), which aligns with 'Behavior'. It does not qualify as 'Attempt' since no concrete past action occurred, and it's more than just ideation due to the explicit plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to the user's past suicidal thoughts, current thoughts triggered by someone else's attempt, feelings that suicide now seems more attainable and ""ok to try,"" and a desire to stop thinking this way.

Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""it's now ok to try,"" indicating a desire related to suicide. Since it's explicit, this leans toward 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions feelings of disassociation, dysphoria, emotional numbness (e.g., not feeling anything about the dog's passing), and a sense of disconnection from life. There are references to death and suicide, specifically ""nearly killing myself one night"" (indicating a past event) and ""it'll only take one day where I step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" (suggesting a potential future action). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, lack of control, and numbness. Specific plans or methods: ""Step off a building or over a bridge"" implies methods like jumping. References to past attempts: ""Nearly killing myself one night.""

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post implies a desire for control through potential self-harm or suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""step off a building or over a bridge"" describes potential methods.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the mention of methods suggests planning intent.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""nearly killing myself one night"" describes a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes a past attempt (""nearly killing myself one night"") and also hints at current/future plans. According to the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. The post mentions fear that it might be painful, but this does not constitute a specific plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of preparations like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings and future intentions, as seen in ""i want to take myself out"" and ""i just need it to stop."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to take oneself out) but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned; it is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan; and it is not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

380,Screw this. The more I live the more I want to die. Can't be fucked with anything anymore,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair. Specifically, the phrase ""the more I live the more I want to die"" mentions wanting to die, but there are no references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts. The post conveys general frustration and apathy.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with ""the more I live the more I want to die."" Since this is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive, it leans toward ideation, but it's not explicitly the word ""suicide,"" so I must consider the definitions carefully.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or any plan, so this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or ongoing feelings (""the more I live""), not past events or future intentions specifically. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit expression of wanting to die, which fits the definition of Ideation (desire to not be alive without a specific plan). It goes beyond general distress, as it directly states a desire to die, but lacks any plan or method, so it's not Behavior. There's no mention of past attempts, so it's not Attempt. While the explicit mention of suicide isn't present, the direct desire to die aligns with Ideation based on the definition.

My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post describes a 16-year-old struggling with mental health due to quarantine, family criticism (being called lazy, useless, a failure), dropping grades, and feelings of burnout and exhaustion. There are mentions of death and dying, such as ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" and ""I want to die."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, feeling like a coward, and believing no one will care if they're gone. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" and ""I want to die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die) but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no planning, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are detailed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme distress, hatred towards life, parents, a doctor, and daily circumstances. There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically: ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop"" and ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, anxiety about the future, and a general sense of hating everything. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific methods, or preparations beyond the vague reference to emails. References to past events include taking medications and complying with treatment, but not past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""thought about killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""thought about killing myself"" and the implication in ""before I do it.""
   - The mentions are explicit enough to go beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or detailed ways to end one's life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a vague mention of ""emails to send to my parents before I do it,"" which could imply a suicide note or farewell, but it's not explicitly detailed as preparation. Since the instructions emphasize choosing 'ideation' if unsure about explicit planning, I will not classify this as a clear plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to ongoing and past feelings (e.g., thinking about suicide for 5 years and past medication use), with a potential future implication in ""before I do it."" However, it does not describe a past attempt or concrete future action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill oneself), which rules out 'Indicator.' It does not mention specific plans, methods, or preparations in detail, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior.' There are no descriptions of past attempts, ruling out 'Attempt.' Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation,' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

I ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of severe depression and hopelessness, such as ""I'm so fucking depressed,"" mentions of stressors like fear of losing a parent to a virus, living in an anti-LGBT environment, job loss, and a recent negative experience. There are direct references to death or dying through ""Ending it soon,"" which implies suicidal intent. Additionally, there's a specific plan mentioned: ordering 14 grams of dextromethorphan (a substance that can be lethal in high doses) and intending to take it all upon arrival. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""Ending it soon"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the phrase ""Ending it soon"" and the overall context of depression and intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including ordering 14 grams of dextromethorphan, which is a substance, and planning to ingest it all. This constitutes signs of preparation, as the user has acquired means via mail and specified their intention to use it. Since there is clear evidence of a plan, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings of depression and future intentions, such as taking the substance ""as soon as it gets here."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""Ending it soon"") and a specific plan involving a method (ordering and intending to take dextromethorphan), which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' because of the presence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as it describes future actions rather than past ones.

When did Human thought it would be cool living so much?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include questioning the value of life, frustration with the length of life (e.g., humans die around 80, the user is 21 with 60 years left), and reflecting on their own life experiences (e.g., only ""really lived"" 15 years which wasn't good). There are mentions of death in a general sense (e.g., humans tend to die around 80), but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, or dying by one's own hand. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, as seen in phrases like ""it wasn't really good"" and questioning why people want to live. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post expresses general dissatisfaction and philosophical questioning about life, but does not directly state a desire to die or end one's life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plan, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings about future life prospects (e.g., 60 years left), but it does not describe past events, attempts, or concrete future intentions. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal thoughts, and when in doubt about explicit mentions, we choose 'indicator'. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (no explicit desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan), or 'Attempt' (no past actions).

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to ""passive suicidal,"" ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal,"" and ""suicide by cop."" It discusses the potential risk of provoking someone to suicide but does not mention death, dying, or self-harm in a personal context. Emotional indicators like hopelessness are implied in the description of others, but not expressed by the writer. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for the writer, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, terms like ""suicidal"" and ""suicide by cop"" are used, but these refer to hypothetical others, not the writer. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die from the writer? No, the post is advisory and not personal. Since the mentions are not about the writer, and the rules specify focusing on the writer's risk, this leans toward no explicit mention for classification purposes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""suicide by cop"" is referenced as a potential method, but again, for someone else, not the writer. There are no signs of preparation or personal plans from the writer. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but since it's not the writer's own content, this doesn't apply directly.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to hypothetical or general future scenarios (e.g., what might happen if cops are called), not past events or the writer's current/future intentions. No past attempts are described for the writer.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post does not contain any explicit expressions of the writer's own suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts. It is a general discussion about suicide risk in others, which does not qualify as 'ideation,' 'behavior,' or 'attempt' for the writer. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there are no direct indications of the writer's suicide risk, and when in doubt, we lean toward 'indicator.'

Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden. My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens. Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses a potential Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis, access to insulin pens, a past incident of almost going into shock, feelings of depression and not wanting to be a burden, and explicit thoughts of using an insulin pump as a method to end life. There are mentions of death and dying indirectly through phrases like ""the way I choose to go"" and ""how to do it."" Emotional indicators include lifelong depression and hopelessness. Specific plans include using insulin pens or a pump, and references to past thoughts of attempting but not following through due to hassle.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through references to ""the way I choose to go"" and ideas for ending life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the user expresses thoughts of using the pump for this purpose.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, insulin pens and a potential pump are specified as means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user has access to insulin pens and anticipates getting a pump, with ideas already formed.
   - Since methods and preparations are mentioned, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., almost going into shock and prior thoughts) and current/future intentions (e.g., planning to use the pump if obtained).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific plans (e.g., using insulin as a method), which aligns with 'Behavior' as it mentions preparations and methods. It does not qualify as 'Attempt' since no past concrete action is described, and it's not just vague thoughts, so 'Ideation' is insufficient. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit mentions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to ""kill yourself"" on their birthday, feeling ignored and unimportant on their birthday, and general tiredness of everything. There are mentions of suicide through the phrase ""kill yourself,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""tired of everything,"" ""Worst birthday ever""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday? well I do."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user states ""I do and I have a chance right now."" This is clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means. The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" suggests a vague opportunity but does not indicate any concrete preparation or plan. Since it's not specific, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions, as indicated by ""I do and I have a chance right now."" It is not about past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill themselves), which goes beyond general distress and fits the definition of ideation. However, there is no specific plan or method described, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not an indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and it is not an attempt since no past actions are described.

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of stress, mental health struggles, hopelessness, and explicit mention of suicide. Specifically, the user says, ""I'm finally considering suicide,"" which directly references suicide. There are emotional indicators like despair (""I don't want to do this anymore,"" ""It feels incredibly desolate,"" ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit""), but no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I'm finally considering suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements like ""I don't want to do this anymore"" and rhetorical questions about death implying a desire to not continue living.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; it remains at the level of thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""considering suicide"" in the present), with no mention of past events or attempts. It's focused on immediate distress rather than historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (e.g., considering suicide and expressions of not wanting to live), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'ideation.' It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a description of attempting to end their life, physical actions like cutting wrists and thighs with a knife, emotional indicators of distress such as shaking, bawling, feeling like a shell, hopelessness, and regret for not following through. There are explicit mentions of death, dying, and suicide, with references to the act being imminent but stopped. Specific methods (knife) and signs of self-harm (bleeding) are present, along with references to a recent event.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user states they were ready to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (knife). Signs of preparation include having the knife and starting the act (cutting). Since there is evidence of a method and action, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a very recent past event (""I just attempted""), describing an action that was initiated but not completed. It focuses on what just happened rather than future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a concrete action taken (cutting with a knife as part of an attempt), which aligns with 'Attempt' as it involves a past suicidal action. Although there's ongoing distress, the core is the description of the attempt, making 'Attempt' the best fit.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die, such as ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would,"" and ""I feel like killing myself."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""I'm at a dead end,"" ""There's no point to anything,"" and descriptions of verbal abuse and isolation. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools or locations. No references to past attempts are present; instead, the user states they've never attempted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""wanting to.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""despite wanting to"" and ""I feel like killing myself.""
   - The mentions are clear and direct, so this goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or ongoing feelings and intentions, such as present desires to die, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die but lacks any specific plan or method, which fits the definition of 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

My fat ass of a guidance councillor was too busy eating chips to check her email and pull me out of the college level class early on. What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail? I got a fifty last term and the only way to pass is to get a 80 this term. That's impossible. Plus I only have a week left. And my parents, mostly mom, are pure evil when it comes to school and mental health. Killing myself is the only escape.

Kinda sad I never got to do anything. Not that I could've anyways.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape"").
   - Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail?"" ""That's impossible,"" ""stop being a coward"").
   - Specific plans and methods are mentioned, such as slitting wrists with scissors, writing a suicide note, deleting everything, and timing the act when everyone is going to bed.
   - There are no references to past attempts; this focuses on current/future intentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""ending my life,"" ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods are mentioned, such as slitting wrists with scissors.
   - Signs of preparation include writing a suicide note on the notes app and planning to delete everything before the act.
   - This clearly indicates explicit planning, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""when everyone is going to bed""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

392,"""friend"" snitched on me and told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me. this is like preventing someone to get euthanized. what the fuck.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a reference to ""my plan to kill myself,"" which directly mentions suicide. Emotional indicators show frustration and anger, as seen in phrases like ""what the fuck"" and the analogy to preventing euthanasia. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations detailed, such as tools, locations, or substances. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""plan to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by the mention of the plan. Since it's explicit, this moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, only a general ""plan"" is referenced without details like tools or locations. Are there signs of preparation? No evidence is provided. Since no specific methods or preparations are described, and the rules instruct to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure, this leans toward 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a current or recent situation (the plan being revealed and family watching), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts via ""plan to kill myself,"" indicating ideation, but lacks any specific plan details or preparations, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.' It is not merely general distress, ruling out 'indicator,' and there are no descriptions of past attempts, ruling out 'attempt.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of suicide (""im gonna kill myself""), a specific timeline (""3 weeks from now""), and expressions of withdrawal from social interactions (""minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, as evidenced by the intent to isolate and the hope for the baby's safety. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, substances, or preparations beyond the timeline and social withdrawal. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""im gonna kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it directly states an intention to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? The post mentions social withdrawal for 3 weeks, which could imply preparation, but it's not explicit (e.g., no mention of a suicide note or acquiring means). Since it's uncertain if this constitutes explicit planning, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""3 weeks from now""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks specific methods or clear preparations beyond a timeline. This fits 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a detailed plan. It does not qualify as 'Behavior' due to the absence of explicit methods or preparations, and it's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, nor 'Attempt' as there are no past actions.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a question about lethality (""Would this kill me"") and a list of specific substances: Midol (3 bottles), Prozac (30 20mg pills), Tylenol (one bottle), and a water bottle full of alcohol. There are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm, but the query implies potential fatal consequences. Emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair are absent. Specific plans or methods are suggested through the detailed list of substances, which could be used for an overdose. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post is phrased as a question about whether the combination would kill, which is indirect. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' for this step, but I must consider the overall context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post lists exact substances, quantities, and combinations (e.g., pills and alcohol), which are common methods for overdose. Are there signs of preparation? The listing suggests consideration of a method, though not explicit preparation like acquiring items or writing a note. If uncertain about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but the presence of specific ideas (as per the definitions) overrides this and points to 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a potential future or hypothetical action, as it's phrased as a question about outcomes. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post does not explicitly mention suicidal thoughts, so it might initially seem like 'indicator'. However, the Ideation definition states that if the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (such as methods or means), it should be classified as 'behavior'. Here, the detailed list of substances qualifies as specific ideas of a method, even without a direct expression of desire. Therefore, despite the lack of explicit suicide mentions, the presence of a specific plan makes 'behavior' the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of death and suicide, such as ""planning to end it,"" ""suicide,"" and ""doing it in a way that doesn't look like suicide."" It also references a specific method like ""a car accident."" Emotional indicators include conflict over the impact on loved ones and a desire to ""get what I want,"" suggesting hopelessness and despair. There are no references to self-harm or past attempts, but there is a clear indication of planning.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""planning to end it"" and ""I'll get what I want"" express a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, it specifies ""a car accident or something"" as a method to make it not look like suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are indications of thinking about the method, which implies planning, though no explicit details like acquiring tools are mentioned. Since a specific method is described, this leans toward a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""recently I've been thinking of doing it"" and ""How I'm planning to end it."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to die, which rules out 'indicator.' It also describes a specific method (e.g., staging as a car accident), indicating a plan, which goes beyond just ideation and fits 'behavior.' There are no past attempts mentioned, so 'attempt' does not apply.

Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of deep hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness, failure in life aspects like job applications and personal endeavors, and being a burden to family. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair, hopelessness, and resentment from family, but nothing directly related to suicidal thoughts. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts. The word ""attempts"" is used, but it clearly refers to efforts to improve life situations, such as applying for jobs or booking driving lessons, not suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general dissatisfaction with life and a sense of being a ""lost cause,"" but there are no explicit references to suicide or death. Since it's unclear and leans toward general distress, I will choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan related to suicide, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's no evidence of ideation either.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., failed job applications, family interactions) and current feelings of failure, but there are no references to future intentions or past suicide attempts. It's focused on life struggles rather than suicidal behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, plans, or past attempts. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks explicit suicidal content and emphasizes large general dissatisfaction with life. When in doubt about explicit mentions, 'Indicator' is the appropriate choice.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of feeling ""like shit,"" ""alone and depressed,"" and ""fucking sad."" These indicate emotional distress and hopelessness. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general sadness and depression but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear or not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or method, so I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, but here it's clearly absent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general expressions of distress and sadness but lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, plans, or past attempts.

I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try.

I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of emotional distress such as hopelessness, severe anxiety, feelings of worthlessness, and a desire not to continue living. There are indirect references to death through phrases like ""fear of non-existence after death"" and ""I just can't continue."" The post also mentions writing a note, which could imply preparation for suicide, and a recent event involving the ER and hospital transport, which suggests a possible past crisis or attempt. Emotional indicators include despair, isolation, and exhaustion from ongoing struggles. No specific methods, tools, or locations for suicide are mentioned, but the note and ER visit are notable.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going,"" ""it feels like I just can't continue,"" and references to fear of non-existence not deterring anymore, indicating a desire to end life. Since it's not fully explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context pushes toward ideation or beyond.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, substances, or locations are detailed. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions writing a note, which could be a suicide note as a form of preparation. However, since it's not tied to a specific method, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this alone doesn't fully qualify as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events, such as the ER visit and hospital transport last night, which could indicate a recent suicide attempt or crisis. It also discusses ongoing and current intentions, like feeling at the end of their rope and this being their last chance for help, blending past actions with present despair.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a past event (ER visit and hospital transport), which aligns with a concrete action that may constitute a suicide attempt. Although not explicitly labeled as such, the context suggests it was related to a crisis from the described emotional state. The rules for 'Attempt' state that if the content describes past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. Therefore, despite elements of ideation, the presence of a described past action makes 'Attempt' the best fit.

There are mentions of death and dying through phrases like ""Tried to end my life again,"" indicating self-harm or suicide attempts. Emotional indicators include implied frustration and repetition, suggesting despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are references to past attempts, as the post describes multiple failed tries.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""Tried to end my life again,"" which directly implies suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post expresses attempts to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed. Since there are no signs of planning, this does not qualify as explicit behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past events, as it describes attempts that ""didn't work"" and ""tried again,"" indicating historical actions rather than current or future intentions. Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past attempts at suicide, focusing on actions that have already occurred (e.g., ""Tried didn't work"" and ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work""). This aligns with the 'Attempt' category, which is for content detailing historic suicide attempts.

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a detailed description of a past accident (falling from a tire swing), subsequent physical symptoms (e.g., fogginess, hot water feeling in the head, inflammation), various treatments attempted (e.g., doctors, CBD oil, medications), and emotional indicators like feeling hopeless and not knowing what to do anymore. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and frustration, but they are tied to physical health issues rather than suicidal thoughts. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post expresses hopelessness about health symptoms but does not indicate a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear and leans toward general distress, I will choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

I don't show it, I'm not thirsty, I don't act like an entitled incel. I just keep to myself. I don't even try anymore, what's the fucking point? I'm just a fucking sad man. And who wants to be with a sad man? Noone. So that's my company, forever. Noone. I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of loneliness, obligation to live, self-loathing (e.g., ""hideous fucking mutant,"" ""fat retard""), loss of romantic love, and overall despair and emptiness. There are mentions of death and dying, such as ""I will die alone"" and ""the second they're gone, so am I,"" which imply a potential end to life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, sadness, and a sense of permanent isolation. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the post does not use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, phrases like ""the second they're gone, so am I"" suggest a desire to end one's life, indicating a wish not to be alive. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, indirectly through ""I'm only alive by obligation"" and the implication of dying when parents are gone. Since this is not fully explicit, I must lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the overall context shows a clear desire to not continue living.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. The post expresses general intent but lacks details on how it would happen. If uncertain about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, there's no indication of a plan at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""the second they're gone, so am I""), rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (e.g., living only by obligation and implying self-end after parents' death), which fits 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not just 'Indicator,' despite the lack of direct wording. There's no plan or past attempt, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' doesn't apply.

403,"don't know what to do but I'm here for now. got bad urges tonight. not even just suicidal ones, self destructive ones in general as well. they've been happening again for a while now, since I dropped out of college. I'm talking to some friends now. not about them or anything, just random stuff. it's helping, but I'm just lying here wondering if I should tell them. every conversation I have with them these days, I'm just thinking ""this might be our last conversation"". during our dnd sessions, I'm thinking it could be my last. then I read this post on tumblr about the aftermath of suicide on people left behind and I started crying. and there's four friends in particular I'd be worried about and I can't help but think about them and hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling. and now it's just a guilty downward spiral but I can't do much about it right now, and I don't want to worry any of my friends by telling them how bad it is, like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad. I don't know what I want anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of ""bad urges tonight,"" specifically ""suicidal ones"" and ""self-destructive ones,"" which have been recurring since dropping out of college. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, guilt, worry about friends and family, crying after reading about suicide's aftermath, and thoughts like ""this might be our last conversation."" There are references to suicide and killing oneself, but no specific methods, locations, or preparations are detailed. No past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicidal ones,"" ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., thoughts of last conversations and hating oneself for considering suicide).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No; the post says ""I have a plan but no date set,"" but it doesn't specify tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since no specific details are provided, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this leans toward ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and ongoing urges and thoughts, not past events. No past attempts are described; it's focused on present feelings and a vague plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die, guilt over killing oneself), which rules out 'indicator.' It mentions ""a plan"" but without specifics, so it doesn't meet the criteria for 'behavior,' which requires explicit methods or preparations. Thus, it fits 'ideation' as it involves suicidal desires without a detailed plan. No past attempts are indicated, so 'attempt' doesn't apply.

404,"The questionnaires that include a question asking if I've had suicidal thoughts actually make me less likely to talk about. Because I know it'll cause a massive issue and result in a lot of stress. There going to ask me too many details, and be too insistent with their questioning. I find therapy tough enough as it is, and if lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff, then that's great. Well it's great till it starts to happen more and more frequently. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses questionnaires about suicidal thoughts, the user's reluctance to talk due to resulting stress and intrusive questioning in therapy, lying to avoid focus on it, and a metaphorical reference to being in a ""grave I dug myself"" indicating personal struggle or hopelessness. There are emotional indicators of distress, such as stress, difficulty in therapy, and uncertainty about overcoming the situation, suggesting general dissatisfaction and hopelessness. No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post refers to ""suicidal thoughts"" in the context of questionnaires, but it does not directly express that the user has these thoughts; instead, it discusses avoiding them. There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. Since it's unclear and not very explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. No signs of preparation, tools, locations, or any planning are indicated. Therefore, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and ongoing situations (e.g., therapy and questionnaires), with no reference to past events, attempts, or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts or desires. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there is no direct expression of suicide, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There are no elements of planning or past attempts, so 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt' do not apply.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of ""nearly killing myself"" and ""shooting up the school,"" which relate to suicide and potential self-harm. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""feeling like I'm just rotting away,"" ""I fucking hate living,"" and frustration with life's injustices. There are no clear specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned in the current context, and references to past events like ""nearly killing myself"" suggest a near-attempt but not a completed one.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""nearly killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I fucking hate living.""
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""shooting up the school"" implies a method (e.g., using a gun), but it's referenced in the past as something that was nearly done, not currently planned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs in the current context.
   - Since this appears to be about past thoughts rather than current planning, and instructions advise choosing 'ideation' if uncertain, I lean toward 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to past events (""nearly killing myself""), with current expressions of distress, but no indication of future intentions or ongoing preparations.
   - Past attempts are not specifically described as completed; it's only ""nearly,"" so it doesn't qualify as a full attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., hating living, nearly killing oneself), which fits 'ideation' as there are no details of a current specific plan or behavior. It doesn't qualify as 'behavior' due to the lack of current planning, 'attempt' because no concrete past action occurred, and it's not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions.

I can hear my mom In the back of my head saying 'you can't kill yourself with ibuprofen' taking down to a show or someone she knew (at this point I can't remember) I feel stupid because I can hear her voice in my head saying it can't be done. When I sat there and swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle. I definitely feel like my OD was like a *rawrxd* why do I feel like that. Why can't my brain just recognize like I could've died. I wouldn't have (in my brain) I wanted to. . I held off going to the hospital for as long as I could. I don't remember giving consent to go but my boyfriend said I did. Not that I could consent to anything (obv) idk I'm still processing everything and still feel weird even Calling it an OD. Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post describes a past overdose (OD) attempt involving swallowing 120+ pills of ibuprofen and drinking hard liquor. It mentions emotional distress, such as feeling stupid, hearing the mom's voice doubting the lethality, wanting to die, delaying hospital visit, and ongoing processing of the event. There are mentions of death and dying through the OD description and the phrase ""I wanted to."" Emotional indicators include confusion, regret, and distress. Specific methods are referenced (ibuprofen pills and liquor), and it's a clear reference to a past attempt. No current plans or preparations are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of the OD and the statement ""I wanted to,"" indicating a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I wanted to"" in the context of the OD.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, swallowing 120+ pills of ibuprofen and drinking hard liquor, but this pertains to a past event.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post implies preparation in the past (e.g., acquiring and consuming the pills and liquor), but no current signs.
   - Since this is about a past action, it doesn't qualify as current behavior; thus, lean toward 'attempt' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to past events (the OD attempt and its aftermath). There are no indications of current or future intentions, only reflection on what happened.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (OD), which fits the 'Attempt' category as it involves a concrete action that occurred. There are no current plans mentioned, so it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior.' It goes beyond mere thoughts (as in 'Ideation') since an actual attempt is detailed. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include feelings of helplessness, misunderstanding, paranoid delusions, dissatisfaction with the world, wanting to get away, frustration with others' responses, and an explicit mention of suicide as a solution.

No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post states ""Suicide has become my quick solution.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like wanting to ""get away from it all"" and viewing suicide as a solution.
   - The mention is clear, so this indicates suicidal thoughts.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include discussions of depression, the difficulty in continuing daily life, repetitive feelings of monotony, challenges in being understood by others, and the persistent nature of depression. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as seen in phrases like ""it makes it hard to keep going,"" ""every day feels like the previous one,"" and questioning if a long-term cure exists. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of self-harm (cutting for a long time, resulting in scars), emotional numbness since age 12, military discharge for psychological reasons, diagnosis of sociopath and self-mutilation, contemplating suicide for the past month due to lack of joy, love, and tendencies to lie and hurt others.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., the need to die), rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of ""Ideation."" It is not ""Indicator"" due to the explicit mentions, not ""Behavior"" due to the absence of a plan, and not ""Attempt"" as there are no past actions described.

To be continued.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include multiple mentions of suicide, self-harm, and death, such as ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""Just shoot yourself already,"" ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" Emotional indicators include expressions of hopelessness, despair, and abuse from the parents, like dismissing the user's depression and suggesting their disappearance would make others happier. There are references to past attempts (e.g., trying to kill oneself or cutting wrists) and suggestions of methods (e.g., gun, shooting, cutting), but these are from the parents. No specific user preparations or current plans are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the parents' quotes implying the user should die, and references to the user's past actions. The post shares the user's experiences, so these indicate suicidal thoughts related to the user.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (e.g., gun, shooting, cutting wrists), but these are suggestions from parents, not explicit plans by the user. There are no signs of the user preparing or detailing a current plan, so this does not elevate to 'behavior' for the user.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" indicating previous attempts) and ongoing abuse, but does not explicitly describe current or future intentions from the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past attempts at suicide (e.g., references to trying to kill oneself or cutting wrists), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Although there are elements of ideation through the parents' suggestions, the focus on historical actions by the user makes 'Attempt' the best fit. The rules specify that posts referring to past attempts should be classified as 'Attempt', even if other elements are present.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct question about the ""least painful way to kill yourself,"" which explicitly mentions suicide and killing oneself. There are emotional indicators of desperation and rejection of positive advice, such as ""I know I shouldn't be asking this"" and ""I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described by the user, nor are there references to past attempts. The phrase ""I just need a way to Kim's"" appears to be a possible typo (e.g., ""end this""), but it still aligns with seeking a method for suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post uses ""kill yourself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied through the inquiry about painless suicide methods.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user is asking for methods but not specifying any. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no explicit plan or preparation is detailed, and the rules instruct to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this leans toward ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is seeking information now. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill oneself), but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves desires to die without detailing a plan. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no explicit planning, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""write a suicidal note,"" which directly references suicide. It also includes emotional indicators like ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside,"" suggesting severe internal distress and hopelessness. There are no mentions of specific methods, locations, or self-harm beyond the note. The word ""again"" implies this has happened before, possibly referencing past suicidal thoughts or actions.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through the description of physical pain from emotional turmoil.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Writing a suicidal note is mentioned as an intended action, which can be seen as a preparation for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: ""Again"" suggests prior instances, but it does not explicitly describe a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""suicidal note"" directly references suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the intent to write a suicidal note, which implies a desire related to ending one's life.
   - Since it is explicit, this leans toward a category beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the intention to write a suicidal note is a sign of preparation, as per the definition (e.g., suicide note is listed as a preparation).
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, the mention of preparing a note qualifies as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current/future intention (""I think I'm going to write""), with ""again"" indicating past occurrences, but the focus is on the present/future.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only implied through ""again,"" without details of a concrete past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., intent to write a suicidal note) and mentions a preparation (suicidal note), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves explicit planning/preparations. It is not just ideation, as preparations are specified, and it's not an 'attempt' since no past action is described. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""committing a massacre"" and ""slaying myself."" ""Slaying myself"" appears to be a reference to self-harm or suicide, implying a desire to end one's own life. There are no mentions of death, dying, or suicide in standard terms, but ""slaying myself"" suggests self-inflicted harm. Emotional indicators include a violent tone, possibly indicating distress or anger, but no explicit hopelessness or despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""slaying myself"" implies a desire to kill oneself, which could be interpreted as a suicidal expression. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""slaying myself"" directly suggests a wish to end one's life.
   - Since it's not entirely clear if this is an explicit mention (as it's phrased indirectly), I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' if in doubt, per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward action.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.' Here, there's no plan, so it doesn't reach 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to future intentions with ""I will end up,"" but focuses on possibilities rather than concrete plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes an expression that implies suicidal thoughts (""slaying myself""), which suggests a desire to not be alive. However, it's not a standard or explicit mention of suicide, and there's no plan or method. Per the definitions, this could lean toward 'ideation' for explicit suicidal feelings without a plan, but given the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions, 'indicator' fits best as suicide is not directly stated.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, lack of friends, laziness, daydreaming, shame, and feelings of inadequacy. There are emotional indicators such as hopelessness, overwhelm, and a sense of mediocrity. Suicide is explicitly mentioned as ""suicidal ideation,"" which stems from shame, but there are no mentions of death, dying, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states ""my suicidal ideation."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the acknowledgment of suicidal ideation, though they contrast it by saying ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since there is no explicit planning, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and ongoing thoughts (e.g., suicidal ideation stemming from present shame), with no mention of past events, attempts, or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""suicidal ideation"") without any specific plan or method, which fits the definition of 'ideation.' It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly referenced, not just general distress. It is not 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'attempt' as there are no descriptions of past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of wanting to use a handgun to shoot themselves in the head, which is a clear reference to suicide and self-harm. Emotional indicators show despair and hesitation due to fear of potential outcomes like permanent disability. There are specific plans mentioned, such as acquiring the father's handgun and the method of shooting in the head. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the user states ""shoot myself in the head."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), with the user describing their intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), including the use of a handgun and the location on the body (head). There are signs of preparation implied, such as planning to get the handgun. Since a specific method is described, this goes beyond ideation into behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions and future possibilities, as the user discusses what they ""wanna"" do now, with hesitation. No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (handgun and method), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not just 'Ideation' because of the detailed plan, and not 'Attempt' as it involves current plans rather than past actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although phrases like ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving"" imply general dissatisfaction, they do not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die. Following the rules, when in doubt, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' since the mentions are not very explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

However, it does not describe past suicide attempts or explicit future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct mentions of suicide (""kill myself soon"", ""I'll be gone""), expressions of hopelessness (""don't see the point anymore""), and a vague timeline for the action (""not on Christmas"", ""wait a bit"", ""by February""). There are no mentions of self-harm methods, tools, substances, locations, or preparations. Emotional indicators show despair and a lack of purpose. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself soon"" and ""I'll be gone"". Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through statements indicating a desire to end life and lack of purpose. This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, or locations. Are there signs of preparation? There is a vague timeline (e.g., after Christmas and by February), which suggests some intent, but it does not constitute explicit preparations like acquiring means. Since there is uncertainty about a full plan, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions (""going to kill myself soon"", ""by February""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which rules out 'indicator'. It lacks specific plans or methods, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'. There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it's not 'attempt'. The best fit is 'ideation', as it involves explicit suicidal desires without a detailed plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include direct mentions of suicide (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"" and ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday""), expressions of hopelessness and despair (""I've tried everything,"" ""nothings gonna work,"" ""maybe I wasn't cut out for life,"" ""I'm done being this sad fucked up person""), and indications of considering help (""checking myself into a hospital multiple times a day""). There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, substances, or locations for suicide, but it does reference planning (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out""). No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"" and ""If I kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements indicating a desire to end life and feelings of being unsuited for life.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post mentions a specific time (""on my birthday"") and intent to plan (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out""), which indicates an outline of a plan, even if not fully detailed. This goes beyond vague thoughts and suggests explicit planning, aligning with 'behavior' criteria.
   - Since there is mention of a plan (timing and preparation intent), this fits 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., planning for a future date on the birthday), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and includes a mention of a plan (specific timing and intent to plan), which meets the 'behavior' definition. It goes beyond mere ideation by outlining elements of preparation, so 'behavior' is the best fit. If there were no plan mentioned, it might be 'ideation,' but the explicit reference to planning tips it into 'behavior.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of depression, feelings of failure, being a burden on the family, loneliness, and hopelessness. There are emotional indicators such as despair (""I'm a failure,"" ""I don't deserve love or happiness,"" ""all I deserve is pain and loneliness,"" ""fighting this battle alone,"" ""what is the point anymore""). There is a mention of ""thinking of ending it all,"" which suggests suicidal thoughts, but no references to death, dying, suicide explicitly as a word, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""thinking of ending it all"" implies a desire to end one's life, which is a common euphemism for suicide. However, since it's not a very explicit mention like directly saying ""I want to kill myself,"" I must lean toward 'indicator' if unclear—but this phrase is recognizable as suicidal ideation, so I'll note it as an indicator of thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. It's just a general thought, so if uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here it's clearly not detailed enough for behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and thoughts (""now I've been thinking of ending it all,"" ""This week was not the best""), with no mention of past events or attempts. It's focused on present intentions rather than history.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses suicidal thoughts through ""thinking of ending it all,"" which qualifies as explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, fitting the Ideation category. There is no specific plan or method, so it's not Behavior. It's not Indicator because of the direct implication of wanting to end life, and it's not Attempt as no past actions are described.

Specific plans or preparations are noted, such as planning to ""attempt this weekend"" and getting a ""will in place"" to handle assets. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned through words like ""attempt"" and references to one's own death. There are direct expressions of wanting to die, as seen in phrases like ""I want to get it over with"" and ""my death will be following very soon."" This is clear and not vague, so it's beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not detailed (e.g., no tools or substances mentioned), but there are signs of preparation, such as planning the attempt for ""this weekend"" and arranging a will. This indicates explicit planning, which goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and future intentions, specifically an attempt planned for this weekend and death following soon. There are no references to past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to die) along with a specific plan (timing of the attempt) and preparations (getting a will in place). This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it involves both expressions of suicidal thoughts and explicit planning/preparations. It does not qualify as 'Ideation' because of the presence of a plan, nor as 'Attempt' since it's about future actions, not past ones. 'Indicator' is not appropriate due to the explicit mentions.

427,"I don't want to. The final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October is coming up. But for the first time i don't wanna die, it's not like i wanna live either but i have stuff to do and I'm in the middle of making plans to move and i don't want to waste money to then die right after. But i really cannot live if i fail. The right time is gone, i have no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep. It's like for the first time in my life I'm almost happy, I'm almost enjoying doing stuff for my new room and I'll have more space to put all the projects i have in mind, I'm having millions thoughts of stuff i wanna do (probably just mania acting up), it's like i have a purpose or something.

I don't know how much I'll have to wait before i finally get some antidepressants but I'm feeling better nonetheless and i don't even know how I'll do it",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions thoughts of dying and not wanting to live, particularly tied to failing a test (""I really cannot live if I fail""). It includes references to death and suicide indirectly through phrases like ""I don't wanna die"" and conditional survival. Emotional indicators include ambivalence (not wanting to die but not fully wanting to live), a mix of hope (e.g., plans to move, enjoying life) and despair (fear of failure). Specific methods are mentioned: lack of access to meds (implying overdose), no place to jump from, and past use of blades for cutting (self-harm). There are no clear references to past suicide attempts, only past self-harm.
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: Yes, through ""I don't wanna die"" and implications of not living if failing.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness conditional on failure, but also moments of positivity.
   - Specific plans/methods: Methods like meds, jumping, and blades are referenced, but in the context of not having access now, indicating past thoughts rather than current preparations.
   - References to past attempts: Mentions past cutting with blades, which is self-harm but not explicitly a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through expressions like ""I don't wanna die"" and references to methods.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, indirectly, as the post discusses not wanting to die now but implies past desires and conditional future ones.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' – However, the mentions are sufficiently explicit to go beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes: meds, places to jump, and blades for cutting.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No current signs; it's about past access and current lack thereof.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' – Since there's no description of active planning or preparations, this fits ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past self-harm (blades) and current thoughts, with future intentions conditional on a test outcome. No concrete past suicide attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., desires not to live under certain conditions and mentions of methods), but lacks a specific current plan or preparations. This aligns with 'Ideation' as it involves expressions of suicidal feelings without active planning. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no current preparations, and not 'Attempt' as no past suicide attempt is detailed.

And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time.

This neverending process only helps the things I hate the most, and I don't know what to do anymore with my life.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of exhaustion, lack of motivation, dissatisfaction with school, work, and family dynamics (e.g., parental comparisons), and a general sense of being trapped in a system that drains one's energy. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and feeling useless, but these are general and not tied to suicidal thoughts. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post discusses not seeing a point in life and not knowing what to do, but it does not explicitly express a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear and leans toward general distress, I am choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., experiences with school and work) and current feelings of dissatisfaction, but there are no references to future intentions or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it emphasizes vague feelings without direct suicidal references. When in doubt, the rules specify choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of failure in classes, toxic family dynamics, feelings of worthlessness, depression, fear, regret, and explicit desires to end one's life. There are direct mentions of death and suicide, such as killing oneself by slitting wrists and bleeding out, shooting with a gun, and starting to cut oneself. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being a burden (""It's a net gain for the world if I die""). Specific plans or methods are mentioned, like slitting wrists, using a gun, and cutting. There are no references to past attempts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, such as slitting wrists, shooting with a gun, and cutting to ease pain. Are there signs of preparation? There is an indication of timing (""Once I get a place""), which could imply some planning, though not fully detailed. Since specific methods are described, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers primarily to current feelings and future intentions, such as ""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"" and ""I'm just waiting for the end."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die) and specific methods for suicide (e.g., slitting wrists, using a gun), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'ideation' because of the specific methods, and not 'attempt' as there are no past actions described.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include multiple mentions of death, dying, and suicide (e.g., ""Death is a mercy I do not deserve,"" ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""contemplating suicide""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, and feeling like a burden (e.g., ""I hate myself,"" ""I'm not worth their time""). Specific plans and methods are detailed, such as ingesting isopropyl alcohol, using a noose, and jumping in front of a car. There are also signs of preparation (e.g., calculating alcohol dosage, testing attachment points, determining timings). References to past thoughts exist, but no explicit past suicide attempts are described.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""suicidal thoughts"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I want to die because I hate myself,"" ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., isopropyl alcohol for poisoning, noose for hanging, jumping in front of a car).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., calculating exact amounts, testing points for a noose, planning to avoid family).
   - Since explicit planning is evident, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to ongoing and past thoughts (e.g., ""for years now"") and current intentions (e.g., ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans""). No specific past attempts are described, only historical ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and detailed plans/methods, fitting the 'behavior' category, as it includes expressions of wanting to die along with specific preparations. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of concrete methods and steps.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to contact family and friends as a potential goodbye, references to ""the day I chose is very soon,"" long-term desires to end life, and feelings of hopelessness (e.g., ""i'm not cut out for life,"" ""everything is fucked up"").

Emotional indicators include despair, selfishness, and dismissal of anti-suicide arguments. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed, and no references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as seen in phrases like ""i shouldn't kill myself"" and ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or explicit preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post hints at possible preparation through ""the day I chose is very soon"" and thoughts of saying goodbyes, but this is not explicit or detailed enough to confirm. Since it's uncertain, I should lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past desires (over a decade), current emotions, and future intentions (the day is soon), but it focuses on ongoing thoughts rather than past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, fitting 'ideation.' There are no specific plans or methods mentioned, so it doesn't qualify as 'behavior.' It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide references, and it's not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

Emotional indicators include despair and exhaustion. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post states ""This the most suicidal I've been in a couple months."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I just want to be out of my misery."" This is clear, so it goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? The mention of ""Not going to contact anyone I know for a while"" suggests isolation but does not constitute explicit preparation like acquiring means or writing a note. Since there is no specific plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end misery, which fits the definition of ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post: The post expresses anger and resentment towards someone who reported the user's account, leading to a ban. It includes a wish for that person to ""die a horrible painful death ASAP."" 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: There is a mention of death and dying, but it is directed at another person, not the user themselves. No references to suicide or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: The post shows anger and hostility, but not personal hopelessness, despair, or distress related to the user's own life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned, as the content is about wishing harm on someone else.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not mention suicide at all.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the expressions are about wanting someone else to die.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is clear, as there are no indications of the user's own suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post vaguely describes a ""horrible painful death"" for another person, but no methods are specified for the user.
   - Are there signs of preparation? None.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no uncertainty here, as nothing relates to the user's own actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current wish for someone else's harm, with no reference to the user's past, present, or future regarding suicide.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post lacks any explicit expressions concerning the user's own suicide, death, or self-harm. It is an expression of anger toward another person, which qualifies as general dissatisfaction but does not mention suicide or a desire to die. Therefore, it fits best under 'Indicator', as per the definition that requires very explicit mentions of suicide to classify otherwise. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen.

   - Key elements in the post include mentions of killing or murdering another person (the bully), expressions of frustration and jealousy from the bully, and a desire for peace by eliminating the bully. There is a reference to ""type of suicide"" in the context of killing others, but it does not explicitly involve the writer harming themselves. No mentions of death, dying, or suicide for the writer themselves. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life due to bullying, but these are tied to plans to harm others, not self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for the writer's own suicide are present. No references to past attempts by the writer.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in the phrase ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others,"" but it is in the context of killing others, not the writer themselves. This does not constitute an explicit mention of the writer's own suicidal thoughts or desires.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, for the writer themselves; the post expresses a desire to kill someone else to improve their life.
   - Since the mention is unclear and not directly about the writer's suicide, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, but they are for killing the bully (e.g., asking for suggestions on how to murder her), not for the writer's own suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs related to the writer's suicide; any preparation discussed is for harming others.
   - Since there are no elements related to the writer's own suicide plan, this does not factor into 'behavior' for suicide risk.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions to kill the bully, with mentions of past efforts to stop the bullying. No references to past suicide attempts by the writer.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but there are no explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or plans for the writer's own suicide. The focus is on harming another person, which does not align with the definitions of 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt' for the writer's suicide risk. According to the rules, suicide risk pertains only to the person writing the post, and since no explicit suicide-related content for the writer is present, the best fit is 'indicator'. When in doubt, choose 'indicator' over other categories.

438,I'm on the verge of suicide. 19F I seriously cannot do this anymore. My mental health really bad and the stress of college is making. Honestly the stress might kill me before I even kill myself. I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide (""I'm on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""I just want to end it all"") and self-harm indicators.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""I seriously cannot do this anymore,"" ""My mental health really bad,"" ""the stress of college is making,"" and ""I'm such a disappointment and failure.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" suggests a possible plan, but no specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are detailed.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I'm on the verge of suicide"" and ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I just want to end it all.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances are named, though ""I know exactly what to do"" implies a plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of preparations like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since the plan is vague and not explicitly detailed, I will lean toward 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""on the verge,"" ""want to end it all""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, fitting 'ideation'. However, while it hints at a plan (""I know exactly what to do""), it lacks specific details on methods or preparations, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'. There are no references to past attempts, ruling out 'attempt'. It is not merely general distress without explicit suicide mentions, so 'indicator' is not appropriate.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to die and a plea for someone to kill the user. There are mentions of death and dying, indicating emotional distress and hopelessness. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""Someone kill me"" and ""I just wanna die."" Since there are direct expressions of wanting to die, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no mention of any plan or method, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings or intentions, not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (""I just wanna die""), which fits the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan, so it is not behavior. It is not indicator because of the direct expression of wanting to die, and it is not attempt as no past actions are mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of distress related to sexual orientation (being attracted to males), gender dysphoria, past trauma (molested at 5 years, raised by women doing girl things), unhappiness, depression, rejection, and loneliness. The post is a plea to God for change, asking to be made ""straight,"" ""normal,"" and free from negative thoughts, gayness, gender dysphoria, and depression.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: None are present. The language focuses on wanting to be ""normal"" and ending struggles, but not through death or harm.
   - Emotional indicators: There are signs of hopelessness, despair, tiredness, and depression (e.g., ""tired of being unhappy,"" ""lost and alone,"" ""always rejected""), indicating general dissatisfaction with life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mentions of any plans, methods, or preparations for suicide or self-harm.
   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts; only past trauma like molestation is mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire for change and relief from distress but does not include any statements about wanting to end life.
   - Since there are no explicit mentions, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no indication of any planning, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but uncertainty isn't present here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., molestation at 5 years, unhappy life) and current/future intentions (e.g., pleading for God to make changes now and in the future). However, it does not describe or imply any suicidal intentions in any timeframe.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or any plans. According to the definitions, this aligns with 'Indicator' because it lacks direct suicidal expressions. Even with strong emotional indicators like depression and rejection, without explicit suicide mentions, it remains 'Indicator'. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post: The post discusses chronic knee pain from a mild ACL sprain that has persisted for 8 months, with no improvement despite efforts like stretching. It expresses frustration and hopelessness about the pain. 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: There is a mention of ""suicidal"" in the question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" but it's phrased as an inquiry rather than a personal statement.
   - Emotional indicators: Indicators of frustration, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life due to pain.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used, but it's in a question format asking if others feel that way, not as a direct expression from the poster.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, there are no direct expressions; it's indirect and unclear if it applies to the poster.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since the mention is not a clear, personal explicit expression, I am leaning toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no indication of any plan, so this doesn't factor in.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current ongoing pain and frustration (e.g., ""it's been 8 months""), but the suicidal mention is not tied to past or future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes a vague mention of suicide in a question, but it lacks explicit expressions of the poster's own suicidal thoughts or desires. The definitions emphasize that for 'ideation', there must be explicit expressions of wanting to die, which isn't clearly present here. Given the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions, this fits best as 'indicator'. There are no plans, methods, or past attempts, so 'behavior' or 'attempt' don't apply.

I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, and emotional distress, such as ""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""I'm so tired,"" ""Nothing interests me anymore,"" and references to grief and anger.

Yes, such as ""I just don't want to go on anymore."" This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including a pistol, an escape bag, and dousing in gasoline to light up. These indicate explicit planning with tools and methods suitable for suicide. There are no signs of preparations like acquiring means, but the mention of specific methods qualifies as planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of acceptance of death (""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""die at 50 or earlier""), hopelessness (""the future is really grim,"" ""it's not worth pushing my life further""), and passive behavior like stopping visits to the doctor. There are mentions of death and dying, emotional indicators of despair and indifference to life, but no specific plans, methods, or references to past attempts.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases indicating acceptance of early death and not valuing life extension.
   - This is not unclear, so it goes beyond just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post explicitly states ""I don't have any plans to end it.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is mention of stopping doctor visits, which could imply passive risk, but it's not explicit preparation like acquiring tools or writing a note. Since it's not clear-cut, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future acceptance, not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not prolong life and acceptance of death) but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of self-hatred, depression, feelings of inadequacy, and cowardice. There is a direct mention of ""kill myself,"" which relates to suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through admitting to being a coward for not killing themselves, which implies suicidal thoughts.
   - Since it is explicit, we do not lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? There is a vague mention of ""starve myself or something,"" which could imply a method, but it is not specific or detailed (e.g., no tools, locations, or concrete steps).

   - Since this is uncertain and not a clear explicit plan, we choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself""), indicating a desire related to not wanting to live, but without any specific plan or preparations.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and dying, such as ""no reason to live,"" ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""it's time to die."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, isolation from losing a partner, friends, and family, as well as struggles with mental health, abuse, and substance use (e.g., stopping medication and drinking heavily). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, like tools or locations. No references to past suicide attempts are present; the content focuses on current feelings.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""suicide is their life's purpose"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""no reason to live,"" ""it's time to die"").
   - The mentions are clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No; there are no details about tools, locations, or substances for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, though they mention stopping medication and taking their last Ativan, which indicates risky behavior but not a clear plan for suicide.
   - Since no specific plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., the partner's departure, abuse, therapy) and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing hopelessness and thoughts of suicide), but there are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die) but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and dying, specifically through drowning as a method of suicide. Emotional indicators show a sense of acceptance or peacefulness about death, with phrases like ""sounds rather peaceful"" and ""a nice smooth transition to death."" There are references to a specific plan or method, such as drowning in the ocean, and it's tied to a potential future trigger (getting kicked out of the house). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post discusses ""drowning yourself"" and presents it as an option for the person. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, with statements like ""I think it's the best option for me"" and describing it as a ""guaranteed death.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including drowning in the ocean as a location and means. There are signs of a conditional plan, as the person states they might do it if kicked out, which implies future intention. This goes beyond vague thoughts, as a method and trigger are specified, so it qualifies as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current or future intentions, particularly with the conditional statement about getting kicked out, rather than past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (wanting to die via drowning) and mentions a specific plan (method, location, and trigger), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not just 'Ideation' because of the specific plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

452,"Is life actually worth living anymore?. We've been in this pandemic for a year now and very little, if anything, seems to have improved. I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring items or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; it aligns more with thoughts without concrete steps.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current and future intentions, such as ongoing struggles and fears, but does not describe any past attempts. It's focused on present despair rather than historical events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (e.g., mentioning suicide directly), but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" which are direct references to suicide and self-harm. Emotional indicators include a mix of positivity (excitement about Star Wars) and casual references to suicide, with emojis suggesting a lighthearted tone, but still indicating underlying thoughts of death. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through ""kill myself,"" which expresses a desire to end one's life, though it's framed as something being postponed.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items.
   - Since there is no evidence of a plan, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this fits ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions, as in ""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade,"" rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself"") without any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me,"" which are references to dying and a desire to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and endless misery, as seen in phrases like ""feeling like shit,"" ""There's no end to anything,"" and descriptions of stress and depression. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are explicitly described, though ""again"" suggests prior similar feelings.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not use the word ""suicide"" directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me,"" which express a desire to die.
   - Since these are direct expressions of wanting to die, but not explicitly the word ""suicide,"" I am considering the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear. However, the expressions are clear enough as desires to not be alive, so I'll proceed cautiously toward ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is mentioned.
   - Since there's no indication of a plan, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, but here it's clear there's no plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to current feelings (""Until now. I'm back to feeling like shit"") and implies past similar emotions with ""again,"" but does not describe any past attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only vague references to prior feelings.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me""), which qualify as suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include complaints about the landlord and neighbors causing distress (e.g., reporting a dead body smell, keeping the user awake), severe sleep deprivation, a recent MS diagnosis, feelings of exhaustion, paranoia, and a desire to leave the situation. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm directly related to the user. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and frustration (e.g., ""I'm so tired,"" ""I cant take this torture,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell""). No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; phrases like ""I just wanna leave this place"" and ""I want to leave"" appear to refer to escaping the living situation, not ending life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no indications of any plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current events and ongoing distress (e.g., sleep issues, MS diagnosis), with no mention of past events, attempts, or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life circumstances but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""Possible suicide date is in July""), and there are indirect expressions of wanting to die through debating it. This confirms explicit mentions, so it's not just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: There is a mention of a potential date (""in July""), which suggests a vague timeline, but no specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) or signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means) are described.

There are mentions of death and suicide through phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself."" Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. No references to past attempts.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., suicidal thoughts and the implication of wanting to end life but being restrained by religion).
   - The mentions are clear, so this goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No (no tools, locations, or substances are specified).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, regret over lost relationships, and explicit references to suicide. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" and ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and fatigue, as seen in phrases like ""I'm just so tired of failing everyone"" and ""I can't fucking do another year."" Specific preparations are noted with the mention of suicide notes, but no specific methods, tools, or locations beyond the timeline of New Year's Eve. There are references to past preparations (previous suicide notes) but not actual past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""ending it all"" and ""suicide notes."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I'm thinking of ending it all"" and the overall desire to not continue living.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, substances, or detailed methods are described. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post mentions having made three previous suicide notes and implies this one is final, which counts as preparation. Since preparations are present, this leans toward 'behavior,' but if uncertain, the rules specify to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; however, the explicit mention of suicide notes qualifies as sufficient preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (losing friends and making previous suicide notes) and current/future intentions (thinking of ending it on New Year's Eve). It does not describe a concrete past attempt, only past preparations.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to end it all) and signs of preparation (suicide notes), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by including preparations, even without a detailed method. This is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' due to preparations, and not 'Attempt' as no concrete past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of self-harm (""tried to cut myself""), emotional indicators such as a ""breakdown,"" a ""very bad night,"" being drunk, and wanting to ""feel something real,"" which suggest distress and emotional turmoil. There are no mentions of death, dying, or suicide explicitly, but self-harm is referenced. No specific plans, methods beyond the act itself, or preparations are detailed. There is a reference to this being a past attempt, as it occurred ""last night"" and is described as a first-time event.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No; the post focuses on self-harm as a way to cope, not a desire to end life. Since it's not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the self-harm action complicates this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (""cut myself""), but this is in the context of a past action, not current planning or preparation. There are no signs of ongoing preparation. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this seems to describe an executed action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to a past event (""last night""), with no indication of current or future intentions. It specifically describes a past attempt at self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete past action of self-harm (""tried to cut myself""), which aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' as it involves a historic action that could be considered a suicide attempt. There are no current plans, so it doesn't fit 'Behavior'. It's not just thoughts, ruling out 'Ideation', and it's more than general distress, so not 'Indicator'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""plan to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements implying no purpose in life and questioning why not to proceed.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since there's a mention of a ""plan"" but no specifics, I am choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines when uncertain about explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""plan to kill myself."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and a general desire to die, fitting 'ideation' since there's no specific plan or method described. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'behavior' due to lack of details on methods, and not 'attempt' as it's not about past actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""killing yourself soon."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the post discusses the idea of ending one's life. This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No, only a general intent is implied without any explicit steps or preparations. Since no specific plan is described, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to future intentions (""killing yourself soon""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (desire to kill oneself), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of ideation.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""I've been suicidal since I was 9""), self-harm (""I self-harmed""), wanting to die (""I didn't want to be here,"" ""decide to throw myself off a bridge""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""I can't take it,"" ""tired of everything around me"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I'm gonna commit suicide,"" ""twist my dick off,"" and ""die of blood loss."" Emotional indicators show distress related to not getting a boner, implying frustration and hopelessness. Specific plans or methods are mentioned, like twisting body parts to cause harm and waiting for blood loss. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I'm gonna commit suicide"" and ""die of blood loss."" This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ""twist my dick off"" (a form of self-harm that could lead to death) and ""die of blood loss"" (implying a method involving injury and bleeding).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""I'm gonna,"" with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific plans/methods (e.g., twisting and blood loss), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of methods, and it's not about past attempts, so 'attempt' doesn't apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying in the context of a worsening disease (""My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker. I will eventually die in a much painful way""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, loneliness, and a lack of reason to live (""I endured the physical pain and mental depression for years. I am lonely and have no reason to live""). There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? There is an indirect expression through phrases like ""I have no reason to live"" and references to inevitable death from disease, but it is not explicit (e.g., no direct statement like ""I want to kill myself""). Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no indication of a plan, and if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but in this case, it doesn't even reach ideation level due to lack of explicit suicide mentions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post refers to past events (e.g., ""I endured the physical pain and mental depression for years"") and current/future intentions tied to the disease (e.g., ""I will eventually die""), but these are not linked to suicide or self-inflicted actions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and vague thoughts about dying due to illness, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to end one's life actively. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and the guidelines instruct to choose 'Indicator' when in doubt. It does not qualify as 'Ideation' due to the lack of explicit suicidal thoughts, nor 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there are no plans or past actions described.

The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious.

Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of severe stress, anxiety, isolation, and emotional distress from school, lack of friends, family and social pressures related to being atheist and bisexual, and the ongoing impact of the pandemic. There are mentions of death and suicide: specifically, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, crying themselves to sleep, lack of motivation, and the idea that their little brother is the only thing keeping them alive.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of not wanting to be alive, a ""will to die,"" references to past attempts (""if I do attempt again""), and emotional indicators like hopelessness, tiredness, indifference due to PTSD, constant fear, pain, and dissociation. There are no direct mentions of specific methods, tools, or self-harm, but there is a vague timeline for potential future action.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: Yes, through phrases like ""will to die,"" ""if I do it,"" and ""attempt again.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident in statements like ""I'm tired of buying time,"" ""I don't really want one [future],"" and indifference toward loved ones.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No explicit methods (e.g., tools, substances) are mentioned, but there is a reference to a timeline (""it'll be at least a few months out"") and plans that delay action (""I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time""). This suggests some form of future intention without details.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, implied by ""if I do attempt again"" and ""I'm not going to fail,"" indicating a history of attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through references to ""attempt again,"" ""will to die,"" and ""if I do it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a vague indication of delaying action with ""plans to look forward to,"" but this seems to refer to life events rather than suicide preparations. Since no explicit method or preparation is described, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past attempts (""attempt again"") and current feelings of despair, while also mentioning future intentions (""if I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"" and ""not going to fail""). This combines past, present, and future elements.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die) and references to past attempts. It also mentions current plans or intentions for the future, even if not highly detailed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts along with specific methods (gun, knife) and preparations (waiting period), which meets the criteria for 'behavior.' It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of plans and means, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current thoughts and future intentions (e.g., seeking inpatient care), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts, indicating 'ideation' as it involves desires related to not wanting to live without any specific plan.

I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge. Can't sleep. No future.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include descriptions of daily routine (lying in bed, boyfriend playing video games), emotional distress (feeling mute, nothing to say, graying hair, unemployed, can't sleep, no future), and a direct statement about suicide (""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge.""). There are mentions of death and suicide, emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, and specific references to a plan (time: Monday; method: Bridge). No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it expresses an intent to end one's life.

There is a specific time mentioned (Monday), which suggests intent toward action, though no other explicit preparations are detailed. This indicates more than just thoughts, as a method is specified.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (on Monday), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal expressions and a specific plan (method and time), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond ideation due to the mention of a method, and it's not an attempt since it's future-oriented.

Gah but it's so hard. One of the hardest decisions I've taken iny life. Wish I have more sex before I go though lol. Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions a hangman's noose as a wallpaper to ""stay on track,"" which implies a suicide method. It includes ""kms"" (likely ""kill myself""), expressions of overcoming a hurdle to kms, and references to future actions like ensuring his mom won't be affected. Emotional indicators include despair over a girl, life decisions, religious struggles, and a wish for experiences ""before I go,"" suggesting hopelessness and thoughts of ending life.
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: Yes, explicitly with ""kms"" and the noose.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, regret, and distress.
   - Specific plans/methods: Hangman's noose is mentioned as a method; preparations implied by setting wallpaper and considering timing (e.g., mom's situation).
   - References to past attempts: ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" suggests a recent struggle or near-attempt, but it's not clearly a completed past action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kms"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., planning around it and ""before I go"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (hangman's noose).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (setting wallpaper as a reminder and considering circumstances like his mom's location).
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events? Yes, partially with ""recently overcame a big hurdle to kms,"" which might indicate a past struggle.
   - Does this refer to current/future intentions? Yes, with phrases like ""when I do it"" indicating future plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts (""kms,"" wanting to die) and mentions a specific method (hangman's noose) with signs of preparation, which fits the 'behavior' category. It's not just ideation because of the explicit plan elements. There's a hint of past events, but the focus is on current/future intentions, so 'attempt' doesn't fully apply as no concrete past action is described. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to die, feeling overwhelming pain, mental clutter, inability to sleep or think straight, a diagnosis of depression, feelings of not belonging, unhappiness for two years, anxiety leading to quitting jobs, self-perception as a failure, and a desire not to continue living.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., not wanting to continue), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), which rules out 'indicator'. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'. It is not about past attempts, so 'attempt' is not appropriate. Therefore, it best fits 'ideation' as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing any plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness, but there is no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. The vague phrase ""getting it over with"" is not sufficiently explicit to classify as 'ideation', so I must choose 'indicator' when in doubt, as per the rules.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post includes key elements such as descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., taking 120 aspirin pills at 15, attempting with a gun at 21, and trying hanging with rope recently), current preparation of an exit bag, specific methods (aspirin, gun, rope, exit bag with gas), and emotional indicators like hopelessness, despair, loneliness, anxiety, numbness from depression and depersonalization. It explicitly mentions death, dying, and suicide multiple times.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a desire to die and fears of failing or succeeding in suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (e.g., aspirin overdose, gun, rope for hanging, exit bag with gas), and there are signs of preparation (e.g., researching how to use these methods, acquiring items, setting up the exit bag). This indicates explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (attempts at 15, 21, and recently) as well as current and potential future intentions (preparing and considering the exit bag now).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes multiple past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans, and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also includes current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and worthlessness, such as ""Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile,"" ""I'm a garbage person,"" and ""I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything."" There is a direct mention of ending one's life (""should just end my life""), which implies suicide. Emotional indicators show despair and a sense of being a burden. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""end my life."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it states the user should end their life for their own and others' benefit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since there is no explicit plan, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and future perceptions, not past events or attempts. It expresses ongoing thoughts rather than historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'Ideation.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method.

   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying explicitly through phrases like ""face death,"" ""until I die,"" and ""if I survived... if not, you know what happened."" There are emotional indicators of anger, frustration, and hopelessness, such as ""I'm too pissed,"" ""don't even want to feel good anymore,"" and ""just gonna embrace the pain."" There is a specific plan mentioned: working out until death or passing out, with a timeline of 12 hours. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or face death (e.g., ""until I die"" and implying a fatal outcome). Since this involves clear expressions of desiring death, it goes beyond vague feelings.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through phrases indicating intent to embrace death.
   - Although not using the exact word ""suicide,"" the context is explicit enough to not lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post describes a method: working out excessively until death or passing out, which could be seen as a plan to induce fatal exhaustion.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user states they are starting immediately and provides a timeline (back in 12 hours if survived), indicating intent to act.
   - This constitutes explicit planning, so it aligns with 'behavior' rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions, as the user describes an action they are about to take (""I'm now gonna start working out""). No past events or attempts are referenced.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and a specific plan (method of working out to death with preparation indicated by the timeline).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide (""I have contemplated suicide for years,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" ""I plan to be dead long before I retire"").

No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a question about whether duloxetine (a medication) can kill, which indirectly relates to death or dying. There are no clear emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair. It mentions having a few pills saved for later, which could imply preparation or means for self-harm, but doesn't specify suicide. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post is indirect, focusing on the lethality of a drug, so I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (duloxetine pills as a potential means), and there might be signs of preparation (saving pills for later). However, since it's not clear if this constitutes explicit planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, but overall, the lack of explicit suicide mention overrides this.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current possession of pills and possible future intentions (""saving for later""), with no mention of past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post lacks explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or desires to die, as required for 'ideation' or 'behavior'. It only indirectly suggests risk through a question about lethality and having pills. Given the rules to lean toward 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, this fits best as 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of distress, such as lying about how bad things are, describing the day as ""hell,"" feeling uncared for, feeling empty (likely a typo for ""empire""), out of place, and a statement ""I just want to end but haven't yet."" This suggests emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly, but ""I just want to end"" implies a desire to end one's life. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""I just want to end but haven't yet"" indicates a desire to end one's life, which can be interpreted as suicidal thoughts.
   - This is somewhat unclear, as it's not a direct statement like ""I want to die,"" so per the rules, I should lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt. However, it aligns with explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, as defined in 'Ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - There are no signs of preparation, so this does not qualify as 'Behavior.' If uncertain, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I just want to end but haven't yet""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) without any specific plan, which fits 'Ideation.' It goes beyond general dissatisfaction, as it includes a clear indication of wanting to not be alive. It's not 'Indicator' because of this explicit desire, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are mentioned.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""buy the gas"" indicates a specific method for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is an implication of preparation, as the user mentions not leaving the house to acquire the gas, which suggests a contemplated plan.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as the post discusses potential actions like dying today and the barrier of not buying gas. No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die) and mentions a specific method (gas), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond vague ideation by including a plan, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

490,"I should stop being a pussy and do it. I post about suicide constantly, I should just suck it up and do it already.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""do it"" in the context of suicide, as it references ""I post about suicide constantly."" This implies a desire related to suicide. Emotional indicators include self-criticism and urgency (""stop being a pussy,"" ""suck it up and do it already""), suggesting frustration and hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with ""I post about suicide constantly.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through ""do it"" in the suicide context, expressing a desire to act on suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated. Since it's vague and not explicit, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as it uses phrases like ""I should just suck it up and do it already,"" indicating an urge for immediate action. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., referencing suicide and urging to ""do it""), but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing how. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user's struggles with school, self-harm (cutting their leg), emotional detachment (feeling unmotivated but happy), and explicit plans for suicide. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as planning to kill themselves and specific methods like hanging and cutting off a finger. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., faking school, giving up classes) and despair (e.g., nervous tics, self-harm). Specific plans and methods are detailed, including using a rope, axe, and car, with preparations noted. References to past self-harm (cutting) and a previous unexecuted plan in January are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I planned to kill myself,"" ""I plan to hang myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""it's time to stop the lie and end it"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., hanging with a rope, cutting off a finger with an axe, using a car, in the forest).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"").
   - This clearly indicates explicit planning, so it fits beyond just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., self-harm and a previous plan in January that was not acted upon) and current/future intentions (e.g., the ongoing plan to hang themselves). There is no description of a completed past suicide attempt, only self-harm and unexecuted plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a detailed plan with preparations, which aligns with the ""Behavior"" category. It goes beyond ""Ideation"" due to the specific methods and readiness mentioned. There are no completed past attempts described, so ""Attempt"" does not apply primarily, even though self-harm is noted. The rules specify to choose ""Ideation"" if unsure about a plan, but here the plan is explicit.

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses themes of death and the meaninglessness of life, such as ""you're just going to die anyway"" and ""I wish I was never born."" It expresses emotional indicators of hopelessness and existential despair, like ""What's the point of living"" and ""there still is no point for us being here."" There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although there's a vague wish to not have been born, it is countered by ""don't really want to die,"" and it's not a clear desire to end life. Since this is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no indication of any plan, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but in this case, it's not even at the ideation level due to lack of explicit suicidal thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current general feelings and philosophical thoughts about life, not past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction and hopelessness about life but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit suicidal expressions. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation.'

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include feelings of shame and embarrassment about buying a used pocket pussy, which has led to social ridicule. The user expresses fear about starting a new school and how this incident will affect others' perceptions of them. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include shame, fear, and a sense of having messed up, but these are tied to social and personal distress rather than hopelessness about life in general. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on social anxiety and regret, with no indication of suicidal thoughts. Since it's unclear or absent, I lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no mention of any suicide-related plans, so no need to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (buying the item and starting Nofap) and current/future fears (starting a new school), but there are no references to past or current suicidal intentions or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and sadness about a personal situation, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, desires to die, plans, or past attempts. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it lacks any direct suicidal content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post expresses frustration and anger towards family for bringing the person into the world and not allowing them to ""kill yourself."" It includes mentions of suffering, dissatisfaction with life, and a direct reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and resentment. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill yourself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the discussion of not being allowed to end one's life and enduring suffering for others' sake.
   - The mention is explicit, so this goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It appears to be about current feelings and frustrations, with no reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to ""kill yourself"" due to suffering), but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits 'ideation' as defined. It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide mention, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of loneliness (""lol god damn am i lonely""), feelings of being uncared for (""nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever""), self-deprecation (""Im such a spoiled piece of shit""), and a plea for ending life (""pls fucking end me before the day""). 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There is an indirect reference to suicide in ""say im going to do it,"" which likely implies a suicidal act, and ""pls fucking end me"" expresses a desire for death, though not explicitly self-inflicted.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, and loneliness are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances.
   - References to past attempts: None are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) - The phrase ""say im going to do it"" implies suicide but does not state it directly, and ""pls fucking end me"" expresses a desire to die without specifying suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) - ""Pls fucking end me"" indicates a desire for life to end.
   - Since this is somewhat unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) - No tools, locations, substances, or preparations are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) - Nothing indicates active planning.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, there's no evidence of planning, so it doesn't reach 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and possible future intentions (e.g., ""im going to do it""), but not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? (No)

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general distress and a vague desire to die but lacks explicit mentions of suicide or plans. According to the definitions, very large dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicide mentions should be 'indicator.' Given the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions, this fits best as 'indicator' rather than 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions stabbings (implying death or violence), explicitly references suicide, and expresses a desire for an external event to end their life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and a wish to avoid family shame through death. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned by the poster. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly says ""with a suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the poster expresses a hope to be the next stabbing victim, which implies a desire for death.
   - The mention is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post references stabbings as a method, but it's not a plan initiated by the poster; it's an external hope. No signs of preparation (e.g., no mention of acquiring tools or writing notes).
   - Since there's no explicit plan or preparation from the poster, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (hoping for a future stabbing), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die via an external event and explicit mention of suicide) but lacks any specific plan or preparation. This fits 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without a concrete plan. It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicide mention, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as there's no past action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of ""killmyself"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include expressions of hopelessness, such as having no friends, no social life, no skills, no job, no money, and wanting to ""put an end to it all."" There are references to plans like disappearing, going to another country, getting a new identity, and killing oneself in a way that seems like an accident (e.g., ""with peace and with no one knowing it""). No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killmyself"" and ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""i want to put an end to it all"" and plans to kill oneself).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post describes methods like going to another country, obtaining a new identity, and making the death appear as an accident, which could be seen as preparations for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, such as planning to disappear and create a new identity to facilitate the act without family interference.
   - Since there is mention of specific ideas (locations like another country and means like a new identity), this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., how to disappear and kill oneself), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress or vague thoughts because it explicitly mentions suicide and includes specific plans (e.g., changing identity and location). This fits 'behavior' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts plus preparations, per the definitions. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, not just 'ideation' due to the plans, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.
