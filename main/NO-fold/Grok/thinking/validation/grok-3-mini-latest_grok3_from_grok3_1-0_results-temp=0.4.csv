0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ending life (""thinking about ending my life again""), which implies suicide. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""Never will find love,"" ""Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown,"" ""everything in my life is crap,"" ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself,"" and ""I wish I was even attractive enough for someone."" There is a specific plan mentioned: ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off,"" which references a method (jumping) and location (bridge). The word ""again"" suggests possible past thoughts, but no explicit description of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""ending my life again."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through phrases like ""thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ""go to a bridge and jump off,"" which identifies a location and means (jumping). There are no signs of preparations like acquiring tools, but the mention of a specific plan qualifies as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions (""thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off""). The word ""again"" hints at past thoughts, but it does not describe past events or attempts explicitly.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to end life) and mentions a specific plan (going to a bridge and jumping off), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by including a method and location, so 'Behavior' fits best.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post are expressions of extreme emotional distress (""I'm inconsolable"") and a statement about future death (""I'm going to die soon""). There are mentions of dying, which could imply death, but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but no details on past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" suggests a possible desire or prediction of death, but it is not explicit about suicide. Since it is unclear and not very explicit, I should lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but the lack of explicit suicide mention already points away from that.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""going to die soon""), not past events. There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and a vague feeling about dying, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to end one's life. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' when in doubt. It does not meet the criteria for 'ideation' due to the lack of explicit suicidal thoughts, nor for 'behavior' or 'attempt'.

There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and general distress, as seen in phrases like ""I hate living"" and ""fuck."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""I hate living"" implies dissatisfaction with life, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there's no indication of any plan, this does not qualify for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and thoughts about existence but does not specify past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general expressions of distress and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, plans, or past attempts. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks explicit suicidal content and fits the definition of general dissatisfaction without referencing suicide or self-harm.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""Help me kill myself"") and a specific plan involving a method (barbiturates/Nembutal), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of a concrete method, and there are no past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt.' It's not 'Indicator' because of the explicit mentions.

I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and dying, such as ""Is there a painless way to die?"" and ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" Emotional indicators are prominent, including feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, isolation, unmotivation, fear, and tiredness (e.g., ""I'm struggling,"" ""I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish,"" ""The world scares me,"" ""I feel worthless,"" ""I'm tired. I want to sleep forever""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, nor are there references to past attempts. The post expresses general distress and a desire to escape life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""way to die"" and ""how to die,"" which directly reference dying. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""I want to sleep forever"" and the overall inquiry about painless death. This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just general dissatisfaction.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or preparations; it's only a general question about a painless way to die. Since no explicit plan is described, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., wanting to die now), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (e.g., wanting to sleep forever and die painlessly), but there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the definition of Ideation, as it involves suicidal feelings without concrete planning. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly referenced; not Behavior due to the absence of a plan; and not Attempt as there are no past actions described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""kill myself,"" which directly relates to suicide. Emotional indicators are present, such as feelings of being ugly, stupid, not good enough, tiredness, and loneliness, indicating despair and hopelessness.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, although the user clarifies they don't actually want to, the thoughts themselves express a desire to die as per their brain's influence. Since this is explicit, I do not lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Therefore, if it fits ideation, I choose that over behavior due to the lack of explicit planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying through phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""want to die now,"" ""erase all traces of my existence,"" and specific methods such as ""run towards a cop with a knife"" or ""find a dealer with some opioids.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""want to die now"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I want to die now"" and desire to erase existence).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific methods/plans (e.g., knife or opioids), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It is not just general distress ('indicator') or thoughts without plans ('ideation'). There are no past attempts described, so it's not 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's schizo-affective disorder, lack of sleep due to paranoia about being hurt, a sense of deterioration, a desire to ""get it over with,"" fear of pain associated with ""going through with it,"" and reluctance to seek help due to concerns about hospitalization. There are mentions of wanting to end their suffering, which implies thoughts of death or dying, but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm methods, or past attempts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, fear, and despair.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""if I go through with it"" suggest a desire to end their life, implying suicidal thoughts. Since this is somewhat implicit but still expresses a desire to not be alive, I lean toward considering it as an indicator of ideation rather than just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations like writing a note. The post expresses a general desire but lacks details on how to carry it out. Since there is no explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include feelings of abandonment, self-doubt, and emotional pain from relationships. The user describes expecting people to leave, pushing them away, and reflecting on their own role in this pattern.

Emotional indicators include hopelessness and hurt from repeated experiences. No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is metaphorical and could imply a vague escape wish, it's not a direct expression. Since it's unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, 'Behavior' due to no plan, or 'Attempt' due to no past actions described.

14,"It just really bothers me…and I don't really have the guts to do it. I'm on placement at the moment for work, and once these 6 months are over, I do not know what I'm going to do with my life. I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of suicide (""the only way out is suicide"", ""I think I should just make my escape"", ""I've considered hanging""), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, emptiness, and overwhelm (e.g., ""I feel so empty"", ""things are just crushing"", ""I'm really scared"", ""I cry very easily""). There are no references to self-harm beyond suicidal thoughts, and no specific preparations or past attempts are described.
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: Yes, explicitly with ""suicide"" and ""hanging"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, fear, and dissatisfaction with life are prevalent.
   - Specific plans/methods: ""I've considered hanging"" mentions a specific method (hanging).
   - References to past attempts: None; it's about current thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""the only way out is suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I feel like the only way out is suicide"", ""I think I should just make my escape"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""I've considered hanging"" refers to a specific method).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No (no mentions of notes, tools, or actual steps taken).
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior', but as per instructions, if uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. However, the presence of a specific idea (hanging) aligns with the rule to consider it 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings and considerations, not past events. No past attempts are described; it's focused on present thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""hanging""), which per the definitions qualifies as 'behavior' because it includes specific ideas of how to commit suicide. It's not just vague ideation, as a method is explicitly referenced. Therefore, 'behavior' fits best, as it involves suicidal thoughts plus a mentioned plan element.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide (""i'm going to kill myself""), death or dying (""kill myself""), and preparations (""i already got my suicidal notes ready""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year."" There are no references to past attempts, but there is indication of future intentions with phrases like ""just a matter of when and how.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it."" This is clear and not vague, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not detailed (e.g., no mention of tools or substances), but there are signs of preparation, such as ""i already got my suicidal notes ready,"" which qualifies as a preparation. The phrase ""just a matter of when and how"" implies consideration of a plan, making this more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions (""i'm going to kill myself,"" ""just a matter of when and how""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die, along with preparations (suicidal notes), which aligns with 'Behavior' as it involves explicit planning or preparations. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of readiness, so 'Behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme dissatisfaction with the user's appearance, body, and self-image. They describe feelings of ugliness, self-hatred, and a desire to be someone else. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair about their looks, but nothing explicitly tied to ending their life. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post expresses a wish to ""press a button and be someone else,"" which is about changing identity rather than ending life. Since this is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No; the post only discusses past efforts to improve appearance (e.g., dyeing hair, changing clothes), which are not related to suicide. Since there's no indication of planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings of dissatisfaction and past actions to alter appearance, but not to past suicide attempts or future intentions involving harm. No temporal elements suggest suicidal behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness about self-image, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts expressed. When in doubt, as per the rules, I choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post: The post questions the motivations of people who post about killing themselves or being in the process of doing so, suggesting they are seeking help rather than truly wanting to harm themselves. It mentions ""kill themselves"" and ""in the process of doing so,"" which reference suicide generally. There are no emotional indicators of the user's own hopelessness or despair. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses an opinion about others, but not personal distress.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Suicide is mentioned in the context of others' posts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are present.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in reference to others (e.g., ""kill themselves"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, these are not the user's own expressions; they are about hypothetical others.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since the mentions are not about the user, this does not qualify as explicit for the user's risk.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable, as no plans are discussed for the user.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to general or hypothetical current actions of others, not the user's own experiences.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post discusses suicide in the context of others, not the user writing it. According to the rules, suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post. There are no explicit expressions of the user's own suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts. This fits 'Indicator' because it lacks any direct indication of the user's suicide risk, even though suicide is mentioned hypothetically for others. When in doubt, choose 'Indicator' over other categories.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness, such as ""no point in existing,"" ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""I'm so tired of being alive,"" and ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself."" There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically ""kill myself"" and references to past attempts (""the past two times I've tried I've failed""). Emotional indicators include despair, tiredness, and sadness. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, such as tools or locations. There are clear references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""I've tried I've failed.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""no point in being alive anymore"" and ""I'm so tired of being alive.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this does not elevate to 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to both current feelings (e.g., wanting to kill oneself) and past events (e.g., ""the past two times I've tried I've failed""), indicating historical actions rather than future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (""I've tried I've failed""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. While there are current suicidal thoughts, no specific plans are mentioned, so it doesn't fit 'Behavior.' It goes beyond 'Ideation' due to the clear reference to past attempts. The rules specify that if past attempts are described, even with current desires, it should be classified as 'Attempt.'

   - Key elements: The post mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. It also includes expressions of not caring about life and not wanting to be alive, indicating emotional indicators like hopelessness and indifference. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I don't want to be alive.""
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or preparations.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to kill oneself and not be alive), but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits 'Ideation' as per the definition, which covers explicit desires without planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mention, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions explicit desires to kill oneself (""My desire to kill myself has not""), references to suicide methods (overdose and getting hit by a train), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""what reason is there to live"", ""Why try when it genuinely makes things worse""), and descriptions of past attempts (""I've attempted an overdose twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months"").
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, including direct references to suicide attempts and desires.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness, frustration, and futility.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions overdose (as past) and getting hit by a train (as a contemplated method).
   - References to past attempts: Explicitly described with details on timing and methods.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""desire to kill myself"", ""Killing myself is painful"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""what reason is there to live"", ""I just want out"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (overdose as past, train as a potential means).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly for current actions, but past attempts are detailed; the train reference implies consideration of a method.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this ties into past attempts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past attempts (overdoses) and current desires/future contemplations (e.g., train as an escape).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, with specific timelines.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (overdoses), which fits the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current suicidal thoughts and potential plans, but per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts along with current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not purely 'Ideation' due to past actions, and not 'Behavior' as the focus is on historical events with the overriding rule for past attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme worry about potential health issues (diabetes and DIY HRT), emotional distress such as crying, panic attacks, and feelings of being overwhelmed by personal issues. There are indicators of hopelessness, like ""I can't live without estrogen"" and ""it's just too much,"" but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although ""I can't live without estrogen"" expresses dependency and distress, it does not explicitly indicate a desire to end one's life. Since it's not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plan or method, so if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clearly absent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current worries and feelings, with no mention of past events, attempts, or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness about life issues, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""There is NO hope left,"" financial struggles, and failed treatments like medication, therapy, and TMS). There are references to past efforts with phrases like ""So I tried. And I tried again,"" which could indicate past suicide attempts. There is also a direct expression of wanting to end life (""Now it's time to end it""), but no mentions of specific methods, self-harm, or preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with ""Now it's time to end it,"" which implies a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or preparations. Since no plan is explicitly described, this leans toward ideation or attempt rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events with ""I tried. And I tried again,"" which suggests possible past attempts. It also includes a current/future intention with ""Now it's time to end it.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes potential references to past attempts (""I tried"") and a current expression of suicidal desire (""end it""). According to the definitions, if the post refers to past attempts, even with current plans, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. Although the past attempts are not explicitly detailed, the context supports this categorization over 'Ideation' or others.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of thinking about suicide (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday""), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, loneliness, and disconnection (""I feel lonely"", ""I feel like I am on the moon"", ""nothing fills the hole in my heart"", ""I feel like a creature""). There are no mentions of death, dying, or self-harm beyond the suicide reference. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described. There is a reference to the past (""In the pas I tried to hide this""), but it pertains to hiding emotions, not past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as thinking about suicide implies a desire to end one's life. Since it is explicit, this leans toward Ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since there is no indication of a plan, this does not qualify as Behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current and ongoing thoughts (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide""), indicating present intentions rather than past events. The past reference is about concealing feelings, not attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not Behavior due to the absence of a plan. It is not Attempt as no past suicide actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness, regret over life choices (dropping out of college, cutting off friends), ongoing self-destructive behaviors (drinking and smoking leading to weight gain), lack of fear of death, and explicit references to a plan, note, and date for an event in early April. There are mentions of death (""I'm not scared to die"") and preparations for an action, but no specific methods or past attempts are detailed. Emotional indicators include despair, dissatisfaction with life, and a sense of giving up.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I'm not scared to die"" and the reference to a plan and note, which imply suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user expresses a lack of fear of death and ties it to their overall hopelessness.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are detailed, but there are signs of preparation, such as having a ""plan, note and date.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the mention of a note and a specific date (early April) indicates preparations for a suicidal action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., dropping out of college, cutting off friends) and current feelings, but the plan with a date points to future intentions rather than past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress by including explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and clear indications of planning (note and date), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, nor as pure 'Ideation' because of the preparations. There are no descriptions of past attempts, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself,"" ""go through with it and kill myself,"" ""end up dead,"" and ""cuts I have all over myself."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""The suicidal thoughts have just been too much,"" ""my anger is worse than ever,"" ""no one would care or miss me,"" and ""this will probably be my last post ever."" There are no specific plans or methods for suicide mentioned beyond a vague intent, though it references self-harm through cuts. No references to past suicide attempts are present, only past self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end up dead,"" ""this will probably be my last post ever"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances for suicide are detailed; the post mentions going to an ER for help as an alternative, but the suicide reference is vague (e.g., ""go through with it and kill myself""). No signs of preparation like acquiring means or writing a note are indicated. Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I plan on going to a hospital,"" ""I'm still debating,"" ""haven't even left home yet""), with mentions of ongoing self-harm but no description of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method for suicide. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as there are no details on how to carry it out. If unsure about an explicit plan, 'Ideation' is chosen over 'Behavior.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I can't kill myself"" and ""I know a good clif"" (likely referring to a cliff for jumping). Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""Im so tired,"" ""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point,"" and feelings of being unsupported. There is a reference to a specific method (a cliff) and its feasibility (it's 4-5km away and possible to get there), but no clear signs of preparation beyond awareness. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I can't kill myself"" and ""I told someone that im suicidal."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied through the desire to end life but inability to act. This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as a cliff as a location for suicide. There are signs of consideration, like knowing the distance and that it's possible to reach, which indicates a specific idea of how to proceed. However, this does not describe full preparation (e.g., no mention of acquiring means or writing a note). Since specific ideas of methods are present, this aligns with the need to consider it as 'behavior' per the definitions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., current inability to act), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (cliff), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning elements. It goes beyond vague ideation due to the detailed reference to a location and feasibility, so 'behavior' fits best. If there were uncertainty about the plan, I would choose 'ideation,' but here it's evident.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme exhaustion, self-hatred, isolation, and dissatisfaction with life, such as ""i'm tired of everything,"" ""i'm tired of my life,"" ""i'm tired of hating myself,"" and ""i just want it all to stop."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like crying, fear, and feeling disgusting or ugly. No mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""i wish i was never born"" and ""i just want it all to stop"" indicate a desire not to exist.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing feelings, with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire not to be alive (""i wish i was never born""), which fits the Ideation category. There is no specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as Behavior. Although the mention is not a direct reference to suicide, the explicit desire not to exist aligns with Ideation based on its definition.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of depression, frustration with family support, and a direct statement about wanting to kill oneself. There are mentions of suicide (""kill myself""), references to a funeral, and emotional indicators of hopelessness, anger, and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no explicit plan is present, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I can't wait to...""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to kill oneself, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'ideation' best, as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing how to act on them.

29,"I'm ready. I'm finally ready to just end it all, I'm gonna wait a few weeks but I already know how I'm gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell anyone either, all ready tried that before and no one really understands. So goodbye everybody, I doubt anyone will care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""end it all,"" which implies suicide or death. It includes emotional indicators like readiness to end life, hopelessness (e.g., ""no one really understands,"" ""I doubt anyone will care""), and a farewell (""goodbye everybody""). There are references to a plan (""I already know how I'm gonna do it"") and timing (""gonna wait a few weeks""). It also alludes to past experiences (""all ready tried that before""), but this seems to refer to seeking help rather than a suicide attempt.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, through phrases like ""end it all.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" suggests a specific method is in mind, and ""gonna wait a few weeks"" indicates timing as preparation.
   - References to past attempts: No clear reference; ""all ready tried that before"" likely means trying to tell others, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""end it all"" and expressions of readiness to end life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I'm ready to just end it all.""
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, indirectly – ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" indicates a specific plan or method is formed, even if not detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""gonna wait a few weeks"" suggests timing as part of preparation.
   - Although the method isn't explicitly described (e.g., no tools or locations named), the post mentions a plan briefly, which aligns with 'behavior'. Since it's not entirely uncertain, 'behavior' fits over 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm ready,"" ""gonna wait a few weeks,"" ""goodbye""), not past events. No specific description of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to end it all) and mentions a plan (e.g., knowing how and preparing by waiting). This meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves explicit expressions plus a plan, even if briefly mentioned. It does not qualify as 'attempt' since no past action is described, and it's more than just ideation due to the plan element.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of being a burden, disappointment, hopelessness, and worthlessness. There are direct mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I can't even fucking kill myself"" and ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it."" Emotional indicators include despair, self-loathing, and thoughts that others would be better off without the person. There are no specific plans or methods beyond mentioning a blade, and no references to past attempts are explicitly described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through statements like ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"" and the overall tone of wishing for non-existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a blade is mentioned as something they hold, which could imply a method for self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a mention of holding the blade, but no clear signs of broader preparation like acquiring means or writing a note. Since it's unclear if this constitutes a full explicit plan, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, with no explicit references to past events or completed attempts. It's focused on present struggles rather than historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), but while a method (blade) is mentioned, there is no detailed plan or preparation described. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without a specific plan. If unsure about the plan, 'Ideation' is preferred over 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of depression, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life and family. There is a mention of dying (""how about i die then""), which indicates a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include despair about individuality and family neglect. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""how about i die then,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die. This qualifies as an explicit suicidal thought.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., present dissatisfaction with family), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to die but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' due to the direct mention of wanting to die, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""There is no hope. All is lost,"" ""pointless, meaningless""), explicit mentions of suicide and death (e.g., ""killing myself will happen,"" ""taking my own life,"" ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday""), and a vague timeline (e.g., before 2023). There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show deep distress and confirmation of intent, but no references to past suicide attempts—only a possible reference to past efforts to live (""At least I DID try"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""taking my own life""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I will be taking my own life,"" ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday""). The language is clear and direct.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? The mention of a computer wallpaper as a reminder could suggest mental preparation, but it does not qualify as explicit preparation (e.g., writing a note or acquiring lethal items). Since no specific plan is detailed, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to future intentions (e.g., ""killing myself will happen,"" ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday in 2023"") rather than past events. There is no description of a past suicide attempt, only a vague reference to having ""tried"" in the past, which seems to mean trying to live.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparations. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing how. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a specific plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no descriptions of past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme tiredness, emotional pain (being criticized and unloved), regret over a past opportunity to end one's life, and ongoing desires to ""kill myself."" There are mentions of suicide through phrases like ""kill myself,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and regret. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to actual past attempts, only a missed opportunity.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct phrases like ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"" and regret for not acting on a past opportunity.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates current or past preparations. Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (an opportunity 6 months ago that was not acted upon) and current/future intentions (ongoing desires to ""go back and kill myself""). It does not describe a concrete past attempt, as no action was taken.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, making it best categorized as 'Ideation.' It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Behavior' due to no plan, or 'Attempt' since no concrete past action occurred.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include feelings of weakness, betrayal by a best friend who is dating the user's ex, attempts to distance from toxic people, setting an ultimatum, and ongoing emotional pain from being used. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, embarrassment, and a sense of being pathetic and weak, reflecting general dissatisfaction with relationships and life. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses emotional distress and a desire for normalcy in relationships, but nothing about ending life or suicide. Since there's no explicit mention, I lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post only discusses interpersonal conflicts and an ultimatum related to friendships, with no reference to suicide-related plans. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but there's no indication here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to recent and current events, such as setting an ultimatum last week and ongoing interactions, but it does not involve past or future suicidal intentions or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life and relationships, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or any plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' because suicide is not mentioned at all, and the rules specify that even significant hopelessness without explicit suicide references should be classified as 'Indicator'. When in doubt, choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of deep emotional distress, such as feeling hollow, sadness, hopelessness, self-hatred, and a desire to not exist. There are mentions of wishing to not live another day and wanting to ""not exist,"" which indicate a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include isolation, lack of happiness, and comparisons to others' suffering. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I just want to not exist"" and ""I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day,"" which express a desire to not be alive. Although not using the word ""suicide,"" these are direct indicators of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning, so this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and past experiences (e.g., not enjoying birthdays for years), but it focuses on ongoing emotions rather than past suicide attempts or future intentions with specifics.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to not be alive (""I just want to not exist""), but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of Ideation. Although the word ""suicide"" is not used, the direct expression of wanting to not exist aligns with suicidal feelings without planning, so I am classifying it as Ideation rather than Indicator.

Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, like ""losing my mind,"" ""complete breakdown,"" ""hate myself,"" ""tired of being alone,"" ""feeling worthless,"" and ""failing everything.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as seen in phrases like ""take my own life,"" ""put a bullet right through it,"" and ""I just want to die."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), such as ""put a bullet right through it,"" which refers to using a gun.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I just want to end it""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""put a bullet right through it""), which qualifies as a plan under the 'behavior' category. It does not describe a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable. It goes beyond general distress, so 'indicator' is not fitting. Although no active preparations are detailed, the mention of a specific method pushes it to 'behavior' per the definitions.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses the user's friend potentially committing suicide, the user's own history of suicidal thoughts and a past attempt, and seeks advice. Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm include: the friend's potential suicide, the user's past suicidal ideation, and the user's ""very serious attempt in 2009."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair related to the friend's situation and the user's past experiences with Crohn's Disease, stress, anxiety, and depression. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned for the user currently. References to past attempts: The user explicitly mentions their own ""very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded"" and notes the friend was committed to a psych ward once.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, for the friend (e.g., ""Friend may kill himself soon"" and ""he is going to commit suicide""), but for the user, it's mentioned in the context of their past (e.g., past suicidal ideation and attempt). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, for the user currently; they state they are in a good place and haven't had suicidal ideation in months. Since the focus is on the user, this leans toward past references.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, for the user. The post vaguely describes the user's past attempt but doesn't detail methods or preparations. No signs of current preparation for the user. If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this doesn't apply as there's no current plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events for the user (e.g., suicidal ideation and attempt in 2009) and current concerns about the friend. No current or future intentions are expressed by the user themselves.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post describes the user's own past suicide attempt as a concrete action (e.g., ""very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded""). This fits the 'Attempt' category, which focuses on historic actions by the person writing the post. There are no current suicidal thoughts or plans mentioned by the user, so 'Ideation' or 'Behavior' don't apply. The rules specify that suicide risk is only for the person writing the post, not others, so the friend's situation is not the basis for classification.

Even on days where I'm actually happy I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts. And it's tempting a lot of the time. I'm tired of always being afraid and upset over little things, I'm tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation. I wish I could be so much better than I am so I didn't live every moment in shame. Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of fear that therapy won't work, parental concern, persistent thoughts referenced as ""lol kermit sewer slide"" (which is internet slang for suicide), temptation towards these thoughts, emotional exhaustion from fear and upset, self-criticism about being lazy and unmotivated, shame in daily life, and worry that help won't suffice. There are mentions of death or suicide through the ""kermit sewer slide"" reference, indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and shame. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""lol kermit sewer slide,"" which is a recognized slang for suicide, and the user describes these as thoughts that are tempting. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the thoughts are described as tempting and tied to ongoing distress. Although it's slang, it constitutes an explicit reference in the context of social media, so I lean toward 'ideation' based on the expression of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is indicated, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current thoughts and feelings (e.g., ongoing thoughts and temptation), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (via the ""kermit sewer slide"" reference and its temptation), indicating a desire related to not wanting to live, but without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' because of the explicit suicidal reference, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it?

   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, as there's no mention of suicide notes, acquiring means, or other preparations, but the specific method indicates planning intent.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I want to kill myself so badly"" and wishing for someone to push them), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific method (jumping in front of a train), which aligns with the 'behavior' category as it includes both thoughts and an explicit plan. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'ideation' because of the specific method, or 'attempt' since no past actions are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""slitting my wrists""), which, according to the definitions, indicates it should be classified as 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'. There are no signs of actual preparations or past attempts, but the presence of specific ideas pushes it to 'Behavior'.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""suicidal feelings are coming back,"" which directly references suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as ""suicidal feelings"" implies a desire related to not wanting to live, though not in explicit detail.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward acting on thoughts.
   - Since there's no evidence of a plan, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events (e.g., past depression and hygiene neglect) and current feelings (e.g., suicidal feelings returning now). It does not describe past attempts or future intentions explicitly.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal feelings are coming back""), which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves desires related to suicide without any specific plan or method.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'ideation.'

   - This refers to current or future intentions (""I'm leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

It includes preparations (suicide notes), which go beyond mere thoughts, fitting 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning/preparations. It's not 'attempt' since no past action is described, and not purely 'ideation' due to the preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying through phrases like ""my suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon,"" and references to past attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts""). It includes emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, trauma, and distrust (e.g., ""I'm fucking done,"" ""I don't trust anymore,"" descriptions of abuse and neglect). There are signs of specific plans or preparations, such as setting a date for suicide (Friday, May 14, 2021). References to past attempts are explicit.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and frustration due to trauma and lack of support.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the set date suggests preparation, and the post implies recent close calls (e.g., ""only reason I didn't die last night"").
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the date constitutes explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both: past attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts"") and current/future intentions (""This Friday is my suicide date"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, multiple references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as feelings of pointlessness, dissatisfaction with life, and a desire to ""disappear forever."" There are mentions of death and dying, specifically ""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35,"" and references to an ""outer limit"" of life at 35. Emotional indicators show deep hopelessness, frustration with societal expectations, and a wish to not exist. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I want to disappear forever"" and ""I know I will die by 35"" indicate a desire to not be alive.
   - Since the mention is not explicitly the word ""suicide,"" but there are clear indicators of wanting to die, I lean toward 'ideation' as it fits the definition of explicit suicidal thoughts, though the rules emphasize leaning toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the desire is sufficiently direct here.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of ending life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is mentioned.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; instead, it aligns with 'ideation' as per the rules to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions, such as the desire to disappear and the self-imposed limit of dying by 35. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to not be alive) without any specific plan or method, which best fits 'Ideation.' It goes beyond general distress by directly stating a wish to disappear forever and a predicted death timeline, but lacks the elements required for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging (with details like using a shower or door frame) and taking pills (with worries about dosage and outcomes like sickness or brain damage). There are no clear signs of preparation (e.g., no mention of acquiring tools or writing a note), but the discussion of specific methods indicates planning.
   - Since specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present, this aligns with the criteria for 'behavior' rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is expressing doubts and thoughts about potential methods in the present (e.g., ""idk if hanging myself would even work""), with no reference to past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions specific methods (hanging and pills), which meets the definition of 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing ways to carry out the act, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I want to die"" and ""killing myself."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and fear (e.g., scared of messing it up). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned; instead, the user explicitly states they don't have a specific plan. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes. This clearly indicates suicidal thoughts.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in the post include references to pills (which could imply a method for self-harm or overdose), expressions of regret for not taking them all (suggesting thoughts of ending life), and emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and feelings of being unloved or uncared for. There are no direct mentions of death or suicide, but the pills suggest potential self-harm. No specific plans beyond the pills are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post implies regret for not taking all the pills, which suggests a desire to have ended life. Since it's not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit desire, I'll note it as present, but the rules emphasize leaning toward 'indicator' if in doubt—however, the context supports suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, pills are referenced as a potential method for overdose. Are there signs of preparation? Possibly, as the user mentions counting pills every night, which could indicate ongoing consideration or preparation. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but the mention of pills as a means qualifies as a specific idea.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to ongoing behaviors (counting pills every night) and past considerations (wondering why they didn't take them all), but it does not describe a completed past attempt. It focuses on current/future regrets rather than historical events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to have taken the pills) and mentions a specific method (pills), which aligns with 'Behavior' as it involves potential preparations and means. Although suicide isn't explicitly stated, the combination of desire and method makes 'Behavior' the best fit over 'Ideation'.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: There is a vague reference to the psych ward ""again,"" which might suggest past mental health crises, but it does not explicitly describe any suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post expresses general distress and struggle but does not directly state a desire to die.
   - Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No methods, tools, locations, or substances are referenced.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No indications of any preparations, such as notes or acquiring means.
   - There is no evidence of planning, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'; if uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's not even at the ideation level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to current and recent events (e.g., ""lately,"" ""past few months,"" ""everyday""), with a possible hint at past events (psych ward), but no specific descriptions of past attempts or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life but lacks any explicit mentions of suicide, desires to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings mentioned. When in doubt about explicit mentions, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'. There are no elements of planning or past attempts described, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' do not apply.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions.

   - Key elements: The post mentions depression (""Iam depressed af""), a past attempt at suicide (""tried to kms yesterday""), and emotional distress (frustration towards mom). There are references to death or dying indirectly through ""about to die"" (though directed at someone else) and explicitly via ""tried to kms."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair from being ""depressed af."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with ""tried to kms"" (which means ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the reference to the attempt, but it's tied to a past event.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about notes or acquiring means.
   - Since there's no evidence of planning, this doesn't qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event (""tried to kms yesterday""), not current or future intentions. It's specifically describing a historical action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (""tried to kms yesterday""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it involves a concrete action that happened in the past. It's not just ideation or general distress, and there's no mention of current plans, so 'Attempt' is the best fit.

To the point that I question if I did something horrific in a previous life and it was so bad that I'm still paying for it in this life. I cant. Please. I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of ongoing pain and suffering for 28 years, questioning past life karma, and a desire to end the suffering. There are mentions of wanting a ""non painful way to do this"" and ""I cant live anymore,"" which imply thoughts of death or ending life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I cant live anymore"" directly express a desire to not be alive.
   - This is not entirely unclear, as it explicitly conveys a desire to end life, so it leans toward ideation rather than indicator, based on the explicit emotional content.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances are detailed; ""a non painful way to do this"" is vague and does not constitute a specific plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of any preparations like notes or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, this fits ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings of suffering and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I cant live anymore""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of ideation. It goes beyond general distress (as in indicator) because of the direct desire expressed, but does not meet the criteria for behavior due to the absence of planning.

Emotional indicators include despair and resignation, as seen in references to family being upset but needing to be remembered. There are specific plans (next week, with drugs) and preparations (writing a suicide note). No references to past attempts or self-harm beyond the planned suicide.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I want to kill myself next week.""
   - This is clear and explicit, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""with drugs.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I just have to write a suicide note.""
   - This includes a timeline (next week), method (drugs), and preparation (suicide note), which indicates explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions (next week), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and includes a specific plan (method: drugs; preparation: suicide note; timeline: next week), which fits the 'behavior' category. It's not just ideation because of the detailed plan, and it's not an attempt since it's about future actions, not past ones.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme tiredness, lack of motivation, dissatisfaction with life (e.g., college, work, health, relationships, financial struggles, loneliness, and jealousy of others). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as feeling cyclic in life, regretting hurtful behavior, and being jealous of a friend's family. No mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm are present. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" is vague and could imply something negative, it does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and possible future intentions in a vague way (e.g., ""i'm ready to get this over with soon""), but it does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or a plan. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator', as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts expressed, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The user mentions overdosing on 500mg of Zoloft, which is a form of self-harm. There are emotional indicators like regret, suffering, and a desire for it to end, but they explicitly state ""I don't want to die."" No direct mentions of suicide as a word, but the act described implies it. Specific methods are noted (overdosing on Zoloft), and it's presented as a recent action. No references to past attempts beyond this event.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" isn't used, but self-harm through overdose is described.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, they say ""I don't want to die,"" but express a desire for suffering to end.
   - Since it's not fully explicit, but the act is described, this leans toward an indicator of risk, though the action takes it further.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, taking 500mg of Zoloft is specified as the method, and it's described as already done to ""punish"" themselves.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act itself implies preparation, as they took the substance.
   - This goes beyond ideation, as it's not just a plan but an executed action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to a very recent or ongoing event (""I have overdosed""), not future intentions or distant past. It's describing a concrete action that has just happened.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes a concrete action (overdose) that has occurred, which fits the definition of ""Attempt"" as it involves a past suicidal action. Even though they claim it won't kill them, it's still an attempt at self-harm. This overrides other categories like Ideation or Behavior, as the rules specify labeling as 'Attempt' for past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include phrases like ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""I'm ready to go,"" and ""I feel so at peace right now, knowing I'm going to,"" which imply a desire to end one's life. There are emotional indicators of resignation and peace, possibly suggesting acceptance of death. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I'm doing it"" and ""ready to go"" suggest a desire to end life. Since it's not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts, this supports moving beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means. Are there signs of preparation? The mention of spending time with a favorite person could imply emotional preparation, but it's not explicit or concrete. Since there's no clear plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions (""in the near future,"" ""I'm going to,"" ""I'm ready""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go""), fitting the definition of 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to these expressions, 'behavior' due to the lack of a plan, or 'attempt' since it's not about past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The user expresses frustration about a past high school experience where they were identified as suicidal, and the principal focused on their grades. There is a mention of being ""suicidal"" in the past, but no current emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair. No references to death, dying, self-harm beyond the past label, and no specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. No references to past attempts are described; it's just about the school's reaction.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used, but it refers to a past event.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as it's in the past tense and not currently expressed.
   - Since the mention is not current and lacks direct ongoing expressions, this leans toward being unclear for ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - No evidence of planning, so if it were to fit ideation, it would be without plan, but the context is past.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events (4 years ago), with the user reflecting on it now, but there's no indication of current or future intentions. No past attempts are specifically described; only that they were labeled as suicidal.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal"" explicitly, but it's in a past context without current expressions of suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts. According to the rules, when in doubt about explicit mentions of suicide, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There's no current desire to die, no plan, and no description of a past attempt, so it best fits 'indicator' as it lacks ongoing explicit suicide-related content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and suicide explicitly with phrases like ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""I'm sad for no reason,"" ""panic attacks everyday,"" ""unexplainable void and sadness,"" and ""nothing will make me happier."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, like tools or locations. References to past events are vague, noting recurring sadness (""not the first time""), but not explicit past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as indicated by the above phrases.
   - The mentions are clear, so this goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, locations, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is detailed, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers primarily to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""Should I just go and kill myself?""), not past events. There are hints of recurring sadness but no description of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), but lacks any specific plan or method, so it best fits 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' without a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

I just hate them that if u are not qualified to give at least average life to ur children then why u still give birth to them and suffer from u? fuck,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include direct mentions of death and suicide, such as ""i should die"" and ""made up my mind to kill myself."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""I am just rubbish sucking at everything,"" ""I hate my family,"" and expressions of self-loathing. There are signs of preparation with the phrase ""I have prepared everything,"" which suggests actions taken toward suicide. No specific methods, tools, or locations are detailed, and there are no references to past attempts, only to recent intentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""i should die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are specified.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have prepared everything"" indicates some form of preparation for suicide.
   - Since preparation is mentioned, even if vague, this leans toward explicit planning, but as per rules, if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.' However, the statement is clear enough to qualify as preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings (""i should die"") and recent past intentions (""made up my mind to kill myself a few days"" and ""I have prepared everything""), indicating ongoing suicidal thoughts with recent actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""i should die,"" ""kill myself"") and mentions preparation (""I have prepared everything""), which fits the 'Behavior' category as it includes suicidal thoughts plus explicit planning/preparations. It does not qualify as 'Attempt' since no past completed action is described, and it's more than just ideation due to the preparation element.

I hope they enjoy my stuff, cuz they never seemed to enjoy my company.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness and isolation, such as feeling unwanted by roommates and having nothing to look forward to. There are mentions of death and dying implied through phrases like ""vanish without a trace,"" ""find a secluded spot where no one will find my body,"" and planning to have a pistol at the end. Emotional indicators include despair and resignation. Specific plans are detailed, such as emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, walking to a secluded spot, and carrying a pistol. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, as indicated by plans to vanish and ensure the body is not found. Since it's not entirely unclear, but the implications are strong, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' if in doubt; however, the context suggests more than vague feelings.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a pistol is mentioned as an item to have at the end, along with a secluded spot, which implies a method and location for ending life. Signs of preparation include emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, and carrying specific items like cash, shoes, a canteen, and a pistol. Since there is an explicit plan with methods, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to future intentions, as the post describes actions that will happen when the user is asked to leave, with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to vanish and die) and a specific plan (pistol, secluded spot, preparations), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It exceeds 'indicator' due to the implied desire and plan, and it goes beyond 'ideation' because of the specific methods mentioned. There are no past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" itself is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die,"" ""i give up now""). This qualifies as explicit suicidal thoughts since it expresses a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and immediate feelings (e.g., ""i give up now""), indicating present intentions rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It goes beyond general distress (as in Indicator) but lacks the elements required for Behavior or Attempt.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

There are no explicit references to past suicide attempts, only self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, he describes deciding on a woodland location, not doing it at home, and planning to leave notes to warn others, which implies preparation for a method like hanging (inferred from context of not getting a rope yet).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, such as pushing people away and specifying the location and warnings, indicating active planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past self-harm and feelings but focuses on current and future intentions, like recent decisions about where and how to act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and includes specific plans (e.g., location and preparations), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore .

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and anger towards the user's mother regarding driving privileges, such as ""I hate my life,"" ""I wanna off myself,"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore."" There are mentions of wanting to die or end one's life, indicating emotional distress like hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die. These are clear indicators of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this leans towards ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current frustrations and feelings, with no mention of past events or attempts. It focuses on present emotions related to the user's situation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

No one in my life cares. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to help me stay alive. No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of being ""suicidal"" as referenced in the hotline conversation, expressions of hopelessness (""feeling kinda hopeless""), desperation for help, and statements implying thoughts of death (""No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone""). There are emotional indicators of despair and isolation (""No one cares,"" ""I have no one to talk to""). The phrase ""tonight's the night I guess"" suggests a possible intention related to suicide, but no specific methods, preparations, or tools are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used directly in the context of the hotline response. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""No one will miss me when I'm gone"" and the implied context of ""tonight's the night,"" which suggests a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means. Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""tonight's the night"" implies a timing for an action, but it does not describe any concrete preparations like writing a note or acquiring items. Since this is not explicit, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions, as indicated by ""tonight's the night,"" which points to an imminent action. There are no descriptions of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, as seen in the mention of being ""suicidal"" and related feelings. However, there is no specific plan or method described, only a vague indication of timing. This fits the 'Ideation' category, as it involves explicit suicidal desires without detailed planning. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the lack of specific methods or preparations, and not 'Attempt' since no past actions are described.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""oxy"" (likely oxycodone, a substance) and ""cutting an artery,"" which are direct references to potential methods of self-harm or suicide. There are emotional indicators such as an apology and a sense of isolation (""i just don't know who else to ask""), suggesting distress. Specific plans or methods are discussed, as the user inquires about combining substances to reduce pain during self-harm. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with the word ""suicide,"" but there are indirect expressions related to self-harm and ending life (e.g., cutting an artery). There is no direct statement of wanting to die, but the context implies it. Since it's unclear if suicide is explicitly mentioned, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per instructions, but the discussion of methods pushes it further.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including ""oxy"" as a substance to lessen pain and ""cutting an artery"" as a means of self-harm. This indicates potential preparation or consideration of a method. If uncertain about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the details provided suggest a plan is being contemplated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current or future intentions, as it's a question about how to execute a method, rather than describing past events. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post lacks a direct expression of wanting to die, which might suggest 'indicator,' but it includes specific methods like substances and self-harm techniques, indicating explicit planning. This aligns with 'behavior' as it involves suicidal thoughts combined with a mentioned plan. Although there's some uncertainty, the presence of methods tips it toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.'

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post: The user discusses a conversation with a friend who suggested the user might kill themselves. The user expresses hurt, upset, and frustration over the friend's comment, mentions their mental health diagnoses (BPD and CPTSD), and seeks advice on how to handle the situation. There are mentions of suicide, but only as something the friend said, not as the user's own thoughts. Emotional indicators include hurt, feeling like a doormat, and questioning if they're overreacting, but no explicit signs of hopelessness or despair from the user. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in the context of the friend's statement (e.g., the friend said the user is going to kill themselves). 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user does not express any personal desire to die; they are reacting to the friend's accusation.
   - Since the mentions are not from the user themselves and there are no personal expressions of suicidal thoughts, this leans toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no indication of any planning, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a past conversation (a couple of weeks ago) and the user's current feelings about it, but there are no references to future intentions or past attempts from the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress and sadness related to the friend's comment, which mentions suicide, but the user does not explicitly express suicidal thoughts or feelings themselves. The definitions emphasize that the risk pertains only to the person writing the post, and here, there is no direct or explicit mention of the user's own suicidal ideation, plans, or attempts. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'. Therefore, this fits best as 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of desperation and fear, such as ""please help me,"" ""i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out,"" and ""i dont know what to do."" There are mentions of potential self-harm and death through jumping out a window, which implies a risk of dying. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and isolation, as the user notes being a teen with family asleep. Specific plans or methods mentioned: scissors (a tool) and jumping out the window (a location and action). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the description of intending to cut the screen and jump out, which implies a desire to end one's life. Since this is not unclear, it goes beyond just vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including scissors as a tool to cut the screen and jumping out the window as the action. This indicates signs of preparation, as the user is currently at the window with the scissors. This is explicit enough to suggest a plan, so it fits behavior rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions, as the user states ""im at my window right now"" and ""i feel like im about to,"" indicating an imminent situation. No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to jump) and mentions a specific plan (using scissors to cut the screen and jump from the window), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the presence of a method and preparation.

My soul is hurting, I don't think I can do it anymore, I've tried every way to cope. I am starting to not care if there's an afterlife or not, but i still want happiness, it's just been out of my reach for beyond a decade, and im starting to want to wave the white flag.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as persistent sadness, anxiety, depression, feeling like a burden, blaming oneself, an emotionally abusive parent, isolation, and a lack of happiness. The user mentions trying various medications without success, getting addicted, and coping mechanisms failing. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""I'm tired of...""), despair (e.g., ""My soul is hurting""), and a general desire to give up (e.g., ""I don't think I can do it anymore"" and ""starting to want to wave the white flag""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not use words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I just don't wanna be here"" could imply a desire not to be alive, but it is not explicit or direct. Given the instructions to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, this does not qualify as explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates planning or actions taken.
   - Since there is no evidence of planning, even if there were ideation, it would not reach 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post primarily refers to current and ongoing feelings of distress, with references to past experiences like failed treatments, but there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts or events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and emotional pain, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here"" are vague and not explicit enough to classify as suicidal thoughts under the definitions. The rules emphasize that when in doubt about explicit mentions, choose 'indicator'. Therefore, this fits best as 'indicator'.

78,"I really, really wish lives were donate-able. Today, I met a guy on the internet of the same age as me. I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago, he lost his mother to cancer, got bullied, got kicked out of school because of a false accusation which stated that he was planning a rebellion and how they were making a very small amount of money. The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user's wish to donate their life to someone else, references to the other person's past suicidal thoughts and hardships, and the user's own expressions of not deserving or wanting to live.

Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-deprecation, and a desire to end their life for others' benefit. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts by the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user states ""he was suicidal like me,"" implying their own suicidal thoughts, and ""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" which directly expresses a desire to not be alive.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and the wish to ""donate my life.""
   - This is clear enough to go beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward acting on these thoughts.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to the user's current feelings (e.g., not wanting to live) and the other person's past events, but not to any past attempts by the user themselves.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as not wanting to live, but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly referenced. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described for the user.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to die (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster,"" ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I'm tired of it,"" ""it's a fucking joke,"" ""Family is a fucking joke""), and mentions of stopping medications and quitting therapy as a form of giving up. There are no direct mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon"").
   - Since suicide isn't explicitly mentioned, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No clear specific methods, tools, locations, or substances for suicide are detailed, though stopping medications could imply passive harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are indications of stopping antidepressants, anti-anxiety, and other meds, which might suggest preparation, but it's not explicit or directly tied to a suicide plan. Given the uncertainty, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm stopping all my meds today,"" ""Hope it all ends soon""), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) but lacks a specific plan or method, making 'ideation' the best fit.

There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, as seen in the desire for freedom from pain. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of any plan, this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""a plan for suicide.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post only expresses a need for a plan without indicating any actions taken.
   - Since no explicit plan is described, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current intentions, as the language is present tense (e.g., ""Why shouldn't I kill myself?"" and ""I just need a plan""), with no mention of past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to kill oneself), but lacks any specific plan or preparations, which aligns with 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (referring to a past failed attempt), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly,"" and describes an action of putting a finger gun in the mouth and pretending to blow brains out.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., wishing to stay in the car during the past attempt and pretending to blow brains out).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, or preparations are described for current intentions; the finger gun is a simulation, not a real plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no explicit current plan is evident, this leans toward ideation, but the presence of a past attempt influences the category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (the failed attempt) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself"").
   - Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions a past suicide attempt (""my most recent failed attempt"") and also includes current suicidal thoughts. According to the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and mentions current plans or thoughts, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. Even though the current expressions lack specific planning, the rule prioritizes the past attempt in such cases.

The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my brains out"" implies a specific method (e.g., using a firearm).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring tools or writing a note, but the mention of a method qualifies as part of a plan.
   - Since a specific method is referenced, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing intentions (e.g., ""every single day I still have the urge""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress by explicitly mentioning suicidal desires and a specific method (""blow my brains out""), which aligns with the 'behavior' category as it includes explicit thoughts plus a plan. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, nor as 'attempt' since no past actions are described. While there's no full preparation, the specific method mentioned tips it into 'behavior' based on the definitions.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there's a vague statement about things being better if they didn't have to try anymore, which implies passive resignation but not a clear desire to end life. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include a direct statement about planning to kill oneself (""I am planning to kill myself tonight""), expressions of isolation and despair (""Everyone is asleep. Everyone who could help me is asleep now. I don't wish them any grief or guilt. This is my problem, my illness, it's on me. I expect nothing from no one""), and a farewell (""Rest In Peace ya'll. ✌️""), which implies impending death. There are mentions of suicide and wanting to die, but no specific methods, tools, substances, locations, or preparations are detailed. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I am planning to kill myself tonight.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the planning statement and the farewell tone.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so this is not an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, substances, or locations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post mentions ""planning to kill myself tonight,"" which indicates a timeline and intent, but no explicit preparations like acquiring means or writing a note. This constitutes a plan based on the expressed intention and timing, aligning with the behavior category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions (""tonight""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and includes a mention of a plan (""planning to kill myself tonight""), which fits the 'Behavior' category as it involves explicit planning without detailed methods. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not just 'Ideation' because a plan is stated, and not 'Attempt' as it is not about past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of regret for past decisions, a desire to suffer pain as punishment, and explicit mention of suicide as a potential solution. There are mentions of suicide and a sense of not belonging or needing to leave. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is directly used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing"" and ""I don't belong here. I need to leave,"" which indicate a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past decisions but focuses on current thoughts about suicide. There are no descriptions of past attempts; it's about present feelings and intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to die, which goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'indicator'. However, there is no specific plan or method, so it's not 'behavior' or 'attempt'. The best fit is 'ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan.

No one is going to convince me otherwise. But yeah I practiced and there was no pain really. I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed. The thought makes me so happy. Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy. I take great solace knowing that this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon. I'm saying this on reddit because if I were to share this with people in real life they'd try to stop me and I don't want anyone to take this away from me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""practicing hanging myself,"" ""finally do it,"" and ""deserves to die."" Emotional indicators show extreme hopelessness and despair, like ""My life is fucked now. There's no turning it around,"" and ""I'm just worthless trash."" Specific plans and methods are detailed, including practicing hanging as a method and preparing to overcome survival instincts. There are references to past actions, such as ""I've been practicing"" and ""I practiced and there was no pain really.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""hanging myself"" and ""finally do it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, evident in statements like ""I can't wait for the day,"" ""deserves to die,"" and ""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging is specified as the method, with details on practicing it.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user describes past practices and plans to continue (""I'm going to keep practicing"") to build toward the act.
   - Since there is clear evidence of planning, this leans toward 'behavior' or potentially 'attempt,' but I must evaluate further.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""I've been practicing"" and ""I practiced"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to keep practicing"" and ""this life will be over soon""). Past actions are described as concrete practices, which could qualify as attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die, ruling out 'indicator.' It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning specific methods and preparations, which aligns with 'behavior.' However, it also describes past actions (practicing hanging) and combines them with current plans, which per the definitions and rules, qualifies it as 'attempt' since posts referring to past attempts with current plans are labeled as 'attempt.'

It mentions emotional distress from past events like the lockdown, anxiety attacks, and dissatisfaction with life. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but the user explicitly denies being suicidal.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: The phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" could imply a vague desire not to be alive, but the user immediately clarifies ""I'm not suicidal or something"" and states that suicide is selfish, which negates any explicit suicidal reference.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, anxiety, and general dissatisfaction are present.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as the user denies it (""I'm not suicidal or something"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? There is a vague expression (""I just don't want to exist""), but it is contradicted by the denial of suicidal intent. Given the rules, when in doubt, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's no indication of any plan, so it doesn't reach ideation level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past events (lockdown, anxiety attacks) and current feelings of distress, but there are no indications of future intentions or plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to end one's life, as the user denies it. According to the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'. There are no plans, behaviors, or past attempts described.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, and a desire for death. There are explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""I want to take my life,"" ""the thought of myself taking my own life,"" and a direct reference to a past suicide attempt (""I attempted suicide last week""). Emotional indicators include despair, feeling controlled by others, and questioning the value of life. There are no specific plans or methods for future suicide mentioned, but the past attempt is described without details on methods. References to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I don't truly want besides death"" and ""I want to take my life.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, or substances for any current or future actions. Are there signs of preparation? For the past attempt, the user mentions drafting a note but not finalizing it, but this is historical, not current. Since no explicit plan for the future is described, this does not elevate to 'behavior' for current intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to both past events (the suicide attempt last week) and current/future intentions (ongoing desires to die). The past attempt is specifically described as having occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""I attempted suicide last week""), which fits the 'Attempt' category. Even though there are current suicidal thoughts, the presence of a described past attempt takes precedence per the definitions. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' as there's no exclusive focus on thoughts without action, and not 'Behavior' since no current plan is detailed.

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions Valium as a substance potentially used to cause death, with phrases like ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" and ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough,"" which imply an intent to overdose. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as seen in ""I just want this nightmare to end."" There are references to a method (Valium overdose) and possible preparation (having already taken some). No direct references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as implying a desire to end life via overdose.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the context of taking Valium to kill and wanting the nightmare to end.
   - Since it's not entirely unclear, but the intent is evident, this leans toward explicit indicators rather than just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, Valium overdose is specified as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" suggests the person has already taken some Valium, indicating action toward the plan.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the method and preparation are clear enough to indicate behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or very recent intentions, as ""I haven't taken enough"" implies an ongoing or immediate action, not a fully past event. No specific past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and mentions a specific method (Valium) with signs of preparation (having taken some), which fits the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the explicit plan and action, but it's not primarily about a past attempt.

I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post includes key elements such as expressions of not wanting to live, references to multiple past incidents of cheating death, and explicit descriptions of suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I don't want to live at all"" and direct references to ""suicide attempts.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as pills, a razor, and prescriptions, but these are tied to past events (e.g., buying pills and writing a note). There are signs of preparation in the past attempts, like acquiring means. Since these are historical, they don't indicate current planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events, including suicide attempts at age 16 and in November 2020, as well as a recent non-suicidal accident. There are current expressions of suicidal thoughts but no indication of future intentions or plans.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of personal failures such as liver pain from alcoholism, marital issues (wife wanting a divorce and taking the house and kids), and business struggles leading to stress and hopelessness.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: The post explicitly states ""Tell me why I shouldn't kill myself"" and ""I'm ready to be done,"" along with a description of an action: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped."" It also includes ""I'm so close to just doing it"" and a plea for reasons to continue.
   - Emotional indicators: There are clear signs of hopelessness, despair, stress, and readiness to end life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post describes using a belt around the neck as a method, which indicates a specific means of suicide, and the action taken (putting it on and sitting down) suggests preparation.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the description of putting the belt on and positioning themselves indicates preparation for the act.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here it is explicit, so it goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a recent past event (the action with the belt tonight) as well as current/future intentions (e.g., ""I'm so close to just doing it"" and asking for reasons not to proceed).
   - Past attempts are specifically described, as the user recounts an interrupted attempt that happened recently.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, a described past attempt (putting the belt around the neck), and mentions of current plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Attempt' because it describes a concrete past action (even if interrupted) and also references current intentions, as per the rule that posts referring to past attempts with current plans should be labeled as 'Attempt.' It does not fit 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Ideation' due to the presence of a method and action, or purely 'Behavior' since the past attempt takes precedence.

EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no direct words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""), but there are expressions implying a desire to not be alive, such as ""to end this bullshit for good."" This suggests suicidal thoughts, though it's not crystal clear. Given the instruction to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I note this but proceed based on context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are mentioned. The phrase ""taking a trip in April"" could imply preparation or a plan, but it's vague and not explicit. Since I'm unsure if this constitutes an explicit plan, I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., the trip in April), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses suicidal thoughts and a vague desire to end life, fitting 'ideation' due to explicit feelings of not wanting to live without a specific plan. It doesn't qualify as 'behavior' because the plan isn't explicit enough, and there's no mention of past attempts, so it's not 'attempt.' It's not 'indicator' due to the implied suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of emotional distress, such as lack of motivation, arguments with parents, feelings of isolation, and hopelessness. There are mentions of death and self-harm: specifically, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything,"" which references getting hit by a car (a potential fatal event) and overdosing on meds (OD likely means overdose, a common suicide method). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and feeling ""blank."" There are no specific plans or preparations mentioned beyond these wishes, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds,"" which imply desires for fatal outcomes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user expresses wishes for events that would end their life.
   - The mentions are clear enough to go beyond vague feelings, so this leans toward explicit indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, such as getting hit by a car and overdosing on meds, which are identifiable suicide methods.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, like acquiring means or writing a note, but the mention of specific methods qualifies as part of planning.
   - Since specific methods are described, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts along with specific methods (e.g., getting hit by a car or overdosing), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation, which would lack specific methods, and is not about a past attempt.

101,"If your attractive and you complain about how depressed you are, go fuck yourself. Call this gatekeeping depression I don't care, but if you're depressed as an attractive person go fuck yourself. You can't begin to imagine the daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body. Being unwanted in literally all facets of life from growing up to adulthood. If youre attractive the world is literally your oyster, I would never stop smiling I was born that way. I would fucking jump out of bed every morning because at least I have that because appearance, which is totally determined by chance, is the thing that has by far the biggest difference in ones life. I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of frustration, envy, and deep dissatisfaction with the user's own appearance, describing life as a ""daily torture"" and emphasizing how being unattractive leads to being unwanted in all facets of life. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair regarding their physical appearance and its impact on life quality.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: None. The phrase ""I would fucking jump out of bed every morning"" appears to be metaphorical for enthusiasm, not a reference to jumping off something in a suicidal context.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong indicators of hopelessness and general life dissatisfaction due to appearance.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses envy and a desire to have been born attractive but does not include any statements about wanting to end their life.
   - Since it's unclear and there's no explicit mention, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no indication of any plan, so no need to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and hypothetical scenarios (e.g., if the user were attractive), not past events or future intentions related to suicide.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness about life due to appearance, but there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit suicidal expressions. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""me being suicidal,"" being abused, severely mentally ill, and explicitly states ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" There are emotional indicators of frustration, tiredness, and hopelessness due to people's ignorance. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. References to past attempts are present.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are implied through descriptions of mental illness, abuse, and frustration.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""me being suicidal"" and ""tried to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the mention of being suicidal and past attempts, but it's focused on past actions rather than current desires.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are specified.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about notes or acquiring means.
   - Since there's no indication of current planning, this leans toward past events rather than ideation or behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It primarily refers to past events (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"") with current emotional frustration, but no future intentions are expressed.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the post details multiple past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes past suicide attempts explicitly, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. It does not focus on current suicidal thoughts without plans (Ideation) or include any plans (Behavior). There's no ambiguity here, as the content centers on historic actions.

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a contrast between common advice about removing sad influences from life and the user's statement that they are ""better off dead."" There are mentions of death through the phrase ""better off dead,"" which implies a desire to not be alive. Emotional indicators include sarcasm or irony, as suggested by the "":D"" emoji, pointing to distress, frustration, or hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the phrase ""better off dead"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the same phrase. This is clear and not vague, so it qualifies as an explicit mention.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is indicated, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or general feelings rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts; it's focused on the user's present thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (desire to not be alive) but lacks any specific plan or method, which fits the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned through ""better off dead."" It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and it is not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of taking 44 paracetamol (an overdose, which is a form of self-harm), physical symptoms like stomach pain, sweating, and shaking, emotional indicators such as feeling like a burden and regret (""i did this to myself""), and a plea for help. There are references to the act of overdosing as a method, but no explicit mentions of other preparations or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of the overdose. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Partially; the user says ""i dont think i want to die,"" but the action of overdosing implies suicidal behavior. Since the overdose is described, this leans toward explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (paracetamol overdose). Signs of preparation include the act of taking the pills, which has already occurred. This goes beyond ideation, as an action was taken, but it's not ongoing planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a very recent event (""almost an hour ago""), making it a past action rather than current or future intentions. No past attempts beyond this incident are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action that has already happened (overdose), which fits the definition of 'Attempt' as it involves a historic action. There are no current plans mentioned, so it's not 'Behavior'. It's not just thoughts or vague expressions, so it's not 'Ideation' or 'Indicator'.

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of wanting to end one's life, as indicated by the repeated phrase ""I want to end it."" This suggests a desire related to death or dying, implying suicide without using the exact word. There are emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness, as the user expresses a strong wish to end their existence. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned; instead, the user explicitly states a lack of ideas on how or when to act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to end it"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life. Since this is a clear indicator of suicidal thoughts, even if not using the term ""suicide,"" it leans toward explicit rather than vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" indicating no plans, methods, or preparations. Since there is no evidence of specific planning, this would not qualify as 'behavior'; instead, it aligns with ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions, as the language is in the present tense (""I want to end it""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'ideation' since there are no specific plans or methods mentioned. It does not qualify as 'indicator' because of the direct expression of wanting to end it, nor as 'behavior' due to the absence of any plan, and not as 'attempt' since no past actions are described.

I'm really trying but it feels completely hopeless bc I know I should be fine. but I'm just not.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress, such as feeling exhausted, trapped in a cycle of highs and lows, like a robot, and overwhelming hopelessness. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair, hopelessness, and a sense of not enjoying life. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there is general distress and hopelessness, it does not explicitly state a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear and the rules instruct to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' in such cases, I will classify it as such.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current feelings and a past situation (e.g., a year since last posting), but it does not describe past attempts or explicit future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator' as it involves dissatisfaction with life without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user discovering they have bipolar disorder, reflecting on past struggles like depression, mental breakdowns, almost being abusive, and physical symptoms (e.g., puking daily for nearly 2 years). They express current improvement, being in therapy, feeling more like themselves, and a general sense of loneliness and uncertainty. There's a vague reference to ""nothing lower but death"" in the context of hitting rock bottom, indicating past hopelessness, but no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include past despair and current acceptance, but no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the phrase ""nothing lower but death"" is metaphorical and general, not a personal desire. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no elements suggesting any plan, so this doesn't elevate to 'behavior' or 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to past events (e.g., rock bottom experiences over the last 4 years) and current improvement, with no indication of current or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes general distress and past hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. The vague reference to death is not sufficient for 'ideation', and the rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions. Therefore, 'indicator' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and suicide, as in ""plan on ending it soon"" and ""overdosing on ibuprofen."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as being ""overwhelmed by guilt,"" wishing to apologize, and fear of pain. There is a specific method mentioned (overdosing on ibuprofen) as a ""go-to plan,"" but no clear signs of preparations like acquiring means. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""plan on ending it soon"" and ""overdosing on ibuprofen.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the post expresses a plan to end life and associated guilt.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, overdosing on ibuprofen is specified as a potential method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, as there's no mention of actions like writing a note or obtaining the substance, but the method is outlined.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this indicates planning, so I lean toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, such as ""ending it soon,"" ""tonight or this week,"" with no reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (overdosing on ibuprofen), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a method, even if details are uncertain. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of relapse into an addiction to extreme pornography, feelings of regret and emotional distress (e.g., ""I feel like shit""), and explicit references to suicide and death (e.g., ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as believing some people are ""meant to be fucked up"" and anticipating worsening feelings in the future. Specific methods are mentioned (a gun), but there are no signs of preparations or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I'd kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as it expresses a desire to end one's life conditionally.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a gun is specified as a method. Are there signs of preparation? No, as it's conditional and doesn't indicate actual acquisition or steps taken. Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., current feelings after relapse and anticipating worse feelings), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (gun), which qualifies as explicit planning. Therefore, it fits best under 'behavior' based on the definitions.

   - Key elements in this post include the user's frustration with their parents' smoking, which they describe as unavoidable and harmful to their health and their brother's health. They mention concerns about lung cancer and express that this worsens their suicidal thoughts. Specific mentions include: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""i just wanna kill myself,"" and references to health risks like breathing in smoke. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, anger, and despair about their living situation and future health. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""i just wanna kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wanna kill myself"" directly expresses a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward acting on the thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and ongoing thoughts, as the user describes how the smoking is worsening their suicidal thoughts in the present. There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill themselves), which fits the definition of Ideation. However, there is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as Behavior. It is not about past attempts, so Attempt is not applicable. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, it goes beyond Indicator.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""move on from this worthless existence.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not detailed (e.g., no tools or substances mentioned), but there are signs of a plan, such as ""I've got a suicide plan"" and ""I plan on doing it next week,"" which indicate a structured intention and preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and future intentions, such as planning for next week, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a mentioned plan to commit suicide (e.g., timing and confidence in the plan), which aligns with the 'behavior' category.

I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a history of depression, suicidal thoughts, a past suicide attempt (many years ago), current suicidal thoughts due to chronic medical issues and pain, emotional distress about seeking help, and feelings of guilt.

There are mentions of ""thoughts of sh"" (likely self-harm) and the specific coping method of ""cutting,"" but no direct references to death, dying, suicide, or explicit plans. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and isolation, but no signs of preparation or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses thoughts of self-harm (""sh"") and cutting as a coping mechanism, but this does not explicitly indicate a desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cutting"" is mentioned as a way to cope, but it's not linked to suicide or presented as a plan to end life. There are no signs of preparation for suicide. Since this is not tied to suicidal intent and is uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if needed, but it doesn't qualify here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ongoing suffering and inability to cope), with no mention of past events, attempts, or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress, depression, and thoughts of self-harm, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'. It does not qualify as 'Ideation' due to the absence of explicit suicidal thoughts, nor 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there are no plans or past actions described.

114,"Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over. If you really loved me, you'd want me to be happy. The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and dying, such as ""when I die"" and ""if I'm dead."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, with phrases like ""my pain is finally over"" and ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead,"" suggesting that death is seen as an escape. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., the word ""suicide"" is not used), but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, as in ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" This indicates suicidal thoughts, though not in the most direct terminology. Since there is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned, and there are no signs of preparation. Therefore, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to future intentions (e.g., ""when I die""), implying current desires rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of ideation, as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It is not indicator because of the direct expression of wanting to die, not behavior due to the absence of a plan, and not attempt as it does not describe past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and death, such as ""kill myself"" and ""take the leap,"" which likely refers to a method like jumping. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, with phrases like ""I don't care about anything anymore,"" ""I don't want to live,"" ""my life is all downhill,"" and ""goodbye."" There are no mentions of self-harm beyond suicide, no specific preparations like acquiring tools, and no references to past attempts. The post expresses strong dissatisfaction with life, career, and future prospects.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I don't want to live"" and ""goodbye.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""take the leap"" implies a method, likely jumping from a height, which is a recognizable suicide method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the phrase suggests a plan. Since specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present, this leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""I finally decided to take the leap,"" with no references to past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a potential method (""take the leap""), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of a specific action.

116,"Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all. Playing witcher 3 before i call it quits. Honestly, i feel so relaxed that it's finally ending. 22 years on this earth was enough for me. Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include phrases like ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" ""it's finally ending,"" ""22 years on this earth was enough for me,"" and ""Goodbye."" These suggest a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include feelings of relaxation about the end, reflection on a bad year, and overall hopelessness. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations, such as tools or locations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as terms like ""end it all"" and ""call it quits"" are indirect euphemisms rather than direct statements like ""I want to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied through phrases indicating that life has been enough and it's time to end. Since it's not fully explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' if unclear, but the overall context shows a clear desire to not be alive, which aligns more with ideation based on the definitions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, locations, or any preparations. Playing a game ""one last time"" might hint at preparation, but it's not explicit. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' so this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""before i end it all""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses a desire to not be alive anymore through indirect language, fitting the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'Indicator.' There's no plan, so it's not 'Behavior.' It's not about past actions, so it's not 'Attempt.'

She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of worry and fear about a friend who reportedly attempted suicide three days ago and is now under restrictions. There are mentions of suicide and a past attempt, but these are attributed to the friend, not the poster. Emotional indicators include distress (""I'm scared"") and a plea for help, but these relate to the friend's situation. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned by the poster. There are no references to the poster's own past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in reference to the friend (""she had tried to kill herself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive from the poster? No, the poster expresses concern for the friend, not themselves.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, and certainly not by the poster. Are there signs of preparation? None are indicated for the poster.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (the friend's attempt three days ago) and current worry about the friend. There are no references to the poster's own past, current, or future intentions regarding suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post involves general expressions of distress from the poster about someone else, with no explicit mentions of their own suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts. According to the rules, the suicide risk must pertain to the person writing the post, not others. Therefore, this fits the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks any direct indication of the poster's suicidal risk.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I will hang myself now"" and ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, loneliness, and despair, as seen in phrases like ""I don't want to be alone anymore,"" ""I've been alone since I was 5,"" ""bullying,"" ""I only sit in my room alone everyday,"" and ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore."" There are specific plans and methods mentioned, such as hanging and searching for an item to tie. References to past self-harm exist, but not as full suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as in ""I will hang myself now."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (Yes), evident in the desire to end loneliness through suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), including hanging and looking for something to tie that will kill. Signs of preparation are present (Yes), such as actively searching for the means. Since there is clear mention of a plan, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and immediate future intentions, as indicated by ""I will hang myself now"" and ""I'm now looking."" There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, only past self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (hanging with preparation), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It does not fit 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, 'ideation' because of the specific plan, or 'attempt' as it describes current intentions rather than past actions.

It feels like I am being ripped apart and put back together incorrectly. I can't stop shaking. How am I supposed to live like this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as feeling shattered, shitty, miserable, barely able to function, being ripped apart, shaking, and not knowing how to live. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; in fact, the post explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" which denies such thoughts. Since this is unclear or not affirmative, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and emotions, with no mention of past events, past attempts, or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, misery, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it involves large dissatisfaction with life without explicit suicidal references. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and dissatisfaction with work, such as being overworked, undertrained, and unappreciated. There is a direct mention of suicide with the phrase ""I just want to kill myself."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, evident in statements like ""I hate this rat race,"" ""I can't handle it,"" ""Tf is this life? I want out,"" and ""I want out now."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor are there references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I just want to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I want out now"" and ""I want out,"" which indicate a desire to end one's life. Since these are explicit, this clearly goes beyond just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is mentioned. Since there is no explicit plan, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and frustrations rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts; it's focused on present desires and intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I just want to kill myself""), which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves a desire to die without any specific plan or method. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide. It is not 'behavior' because no plan or preparations are described. It is not 'attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""I WANT TO DOIE,"" which appears to be a misspelling of ""I WANT TO DIE""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., depression, lack of purpose, self-hate, and viewing suicidal thoughts as a ""cope""), and specific plans or methods (e.g., using extension ladders, isolated wire cutters, making nitroglycerin at home, researching parts, and targeting power plants). There are no clear references to past attempts; the focus is on current or hypothetical actions.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I WANT TO DOIE"" and references to suicidal thoughts as a distraction or cope.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with ""I WANT TO DOIE"" and encouragement to ""go out with a bang.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, such as extension ladders, wire cutters, making nitroglycerin, and targeting power plants, which indicate potential means for suicide or self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post suggests researching and acquiring materials, implying steps toward action.
   - Since specific methods are detailed, this goes beyond ideation into behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""If you change your mind and you want to do it,"" and instructions for preparation), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and includes specific plans (e.g., methods and preparations), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It exceeds 'Ideation' due to the presence of detailed methods and is not 'Indicator' because of explicit suicide references. It's not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include descriptions of severe bullying and harassment towards the user's best friend, such as the bully telling the friend to ""go kill yourself,"" making threats like ""when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you,"" and engaging in online harassment (e.g., creating multiple accounts, photoshopped images). Emotional indicators include the friend being mentally disturbed, tired, not eating, overwhelmed, and feeling unable to stand up for herself. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm directly from the poster. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present in the post.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only as something the bully said to the friend (""go kill yourself""). This is not an expression from the poster themselves.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive from the poster? No, the poster is describing the friend's situation and seeking advice for justice, not expressing personal suicidal thoughts.
   - Since the mention is not from the poster and the rules specify that suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, this does not count as an explicit mention for classification purposes. When in doubt, lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to any suicide methods, plans, or preparations by the poster or the friend.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - No evidence of planning, so if it were relevant, it would lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior', but it's not applicable here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to ongoing events (e.g., bullying for the past 5 days) and the friend's current distress, but there are no references to past, current, or future suicidal intentions from the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post lacks any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts from the poster. The suicide mention is indirect (from the bully to the friend), and the rules emphasize evaluating only the poster's risk. This aligns with 'Indicator' as there are expressions of general distress about the friend's situation, but no direct indication of the poster's own suicidal risk. When in doubt, choose 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" and ""I want to hang myself so bad."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, including feelings of being a ""loser, ugly, no motivation, isolated,"" having ""a lot of mental illness,"" feeling ""alone,"" having ""nothing to look forward to,"" and uncertainty about ""how much longer I could last here on earth."" There is a specific method mentioned: hanging. No references to past attempts are evident.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""suicide is on my mind everyday.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself"" and ""I want to hang myself so bad.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"" indicates a specific method (hanging, implying a means like a rope).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring tools or writing a note, but the mention of a method qualifies as part of a plan.
   - Since a specific method is described, this aligns with indicators of planning, so I will classify as 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current and future intentions, such as ongoing thoughts (""suicide is on my mind everyday"") and desires (""I want to hang myself so bad"" and ""how much longer I could last here on earth""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die) and mentions a specific method (hanging), which meets the criteria for 'behavior.' It goes beyond 'ideation' due to the explicit plan element and is not 'attempt' since no past actions are described. It is also not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions a recent suicide attempt (""last night I attempted once again""), refers to multiple past attempts (""this makes it like what my 15th time?""), expresses ongoing suicidal desires (""still want to attempt again""), and includes emotional indicators of despair (""still alive unfortunately""). It also notes reasons for not seeking help, like lack of insurance and COVID risk, but no specific methods, plans, or preparations are detailed.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicit references to suicide attempts.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness is evident in phrases like ""still alive unfortunately"" and the desire to attempt again.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned; it's vague about future actions.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, multiple past attempts are referenced.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through descriptions of past attempts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the form of ongoing desires to attempt again.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no details on tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about acquiring means or making preparations.
   - Since no explicit plan is described, this leans away from 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past attempts (e.g., last night and previous ones) and current intentions (wanting to attempt again), but the past attempts are the primary focus.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, with details like it being the 15th time.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Although it mentions current suicidal desires, the definition of 'Attempt' specifies that if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. There are no specific plans or methods, so it doesn't qualify as 'Behavior'. It's not just ideation since concrete past actions are described, and it's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions feelings of being at the end of one's rope, hopelessness, physical sensations like breath slowing and chest hurting, fear of going all the way through, and a deep hope not to wake up. It includes emotional indicators of despair, sadness, and isolation. There are references to past actions (""as I've done this before""), implying past attempts at self-harm or suicide, but no explicit mentions of specific methods, plans, or preparations like tools, locations, or substances.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I hope I don't wake up"" indicate a desire not to be alive.
   - Since it's not entirely explicit but leans toward indicating suicidal thoughts, I am considering the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the desire to die is clear enough to qualify as explicit under ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is mentioned.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future hopes (e.g., hoping not to wake up), with a reference to past events (""as I've done this before""). The past reference suggests historical attempts, but the post focuses on present thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire not to wake up) without any specific plan, which fits 'ideation'. It's not just general distress, as there's a clear wish to die. There's a mention of past attempts, but since the primary content is about current ideation without current plans, it doesn't qualify as 'attempt'. No plans mean it's not 'behavior', and it's beyond mere 'indicator' due to the explicit desire.

126,"It's time. Been writing here since June, with the intent to kill myself. I never did it.I have no idea why. Fear of death? I don't think so. Fear of missing out on certain experiences? I have already missed out on so much, so no. I don't think I was ready yet. Not until now. I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side, not sure what will happen once I post this. I could die, or the attempt could fail.but it all doesn't matter to me. The risk is worth the reward. I am not giving myself anymore chances, and I am not going to make any excuses anymore, I am going to shoot myself. I don't think I will delete this account - I want people to see what true failure is. Every other account is gone, deleted. I have no more savings, my room is empty, everything is gone. Too late to turn back now!. To the people who tried to help - thank you. I personally believe you should've never given me your time, but thanks. I hope you guys live long, successful lives. I hope you don't make mistakes like me. Please take care of yourselves. Please give yourselves chances. I know after I am done doing what I need to do, I won't have anymore chances. I have ran out of chances. Goodbye.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and suicide, such as ""intent to kill myself,"" ""I'm going to shoot myself,"" and references to a loaded gun. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, regret, and farewell messages like ""Goodbye"" and advice to others. Specific plans and methods are mentioned, such as having a loaded gun by their side and intending to use it. Preparations are evident, like emptying their room, deleting accounts, and having no savings. There are no references to past attempts, only past intentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""intent to kill myself"" and ""I am going to shoot myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through statements of readiness to end their life and not giving themselves more chances.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a loaded gun is explicitly referenced as the method for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the gun is loaded and ready, and they've taken steps like emptying their room and deleting accounts, indicating preparation.
   - This clearly involves a plan, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past intentions (e.g., writing since June with the intent but not acting) but focuses on current and immediate future actions, such as having the gun ready and stating they will shoot themselves now.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts along with a specific plan (loaded gun) and preparations, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Ideation' because of the detailed plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user's description of a past suicidal episode where they left a note for their parents, swallowed bleach, and vomited it out. There are mentions of death and dying through the act of attempting suicide with bleach. Emotional indicators include depression, stress, feeling unappreciated, crying at midnight, and hopelessness from distance learning. Specific plans or methods mentioned: leaving a suicide note and ingesting bleach. References to past attempts: The user notes that they have had suicidal episodes before and overcame them, with this specific incident occurring a week ago.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user describes a suicidal episode and the act of attempting suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as evidenced by leaving a note saying it's their last time with their parents and attempting to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user mentions swallowing bleach as the method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, preparing and leaving a suicide note.
   - Since there is explicit planning and action, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events, specifically an attempt that happened a week ago. The user also mentions overcoming previous suicidal episodes, indicating a history, but the focus is on this concrete past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a concrete past action of attempting suicide (e.g., swallowing bleach and vomiting), which fits the definition of 'Attempt' as it involves a historic action. There are no current plans mentioned, only reflection on the past event, so 'Attempt' is the best fit.

128,"The only reason I'm alive is cause my parents are still alive. Long story short, I lost my sibling this year and ever since my anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse. After the funeral I basically lost all will to live. But I tried to pull through and find things to do to occupy my time. I thought I was getting better and moving on but I realise when I stop doing everything and sit alone, I still want to die. The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child :/ please help",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the loss of a sibling, worsening anxiety and depression, loss of will to live, and a current desire to die. There are mentions of wanting to die and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post states ""I still want to die,"" which is a direct expression of a desire to end one's life.
   - Since there is a direct expression of wanting to die, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as it's not just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs are present.
   - Since there is no indication of a plan, this would not qualify as behavior; if uncertain, we choose ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""I still want to die""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses a desire to die without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It goes beyond general distress (as in Indicator) by explicitly stating ""I want to die,"" but lacks elements of planning (as in Behavior) or past attempts (as in Attempt). Therefore, Ideation is the best fit.

129,"Acid. I don't want to sound like one of those people , but lsd  has pulled me from the deepest depths of myself and darkest corners.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of LSD as a coping mechanism, personal struggles with deep emotional despair (""deepest depths of myself and darkest corners""), explicit thoughts of suicide (""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end""), and a conditional scenario where taking acid might help, but if not, the person's ""end will only get nearer."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and acceptance of negative outcomes (""I'm fine with either outcome""). No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances for self-harm. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly states ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the ongoing thoughts of suicide and the implication that outcomes could lead to an end.
   - The mentions are clear, so this goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, while the post discusses taking LSD as a potential help, it does not specify any methods for suicide itself, such as tools, substances, or locations. The reference to suicide getting nearer is conditional and not a concrete plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of preparations like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, this does not qualify as behavior; it remains at the level of thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to ongoing thoughts (past months) and potential future intentions (if acid doesn't help), but it is not describing a past attempt or a current specific plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months""), which fits the definition of ideation as it involves expressions of a desire to not be alive without a specific plan. There is no mention of actual planning or preparations, so it is not behavior. It is not indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and it is not attempt as there are no descriptions of past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user expressing that they hit a new low, stole their dog's prescription hydrocodone to feel okay for one night, had some alcohol, haven't felt okay for a while, and are unsure what to do. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and distress, as seen in phrases like ""hit a new low"" and ""haven't felt ok in a while."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide mentioned, though the user describes taking substances, which could imply risky behavior but not explicitly for self-harm. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the user mentions using hydrocodone and alcohol to ""feel ok,"" which suggests coping with distress rather than a desire to end life. Since it's unclear if this implies suicidal thoughts, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post mentions hydrocodone and alcohol, but not in the context of a suicide plan; it's described as a way to feel okay temporarily. There are no signs of preparation for suicide, such as writing a note or acquiring means specifically for ending life. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, it doesn't meet the threshold for either due to lack of explicit suicidal intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to recent events (tonight) and current feelings, with no mention of past or future intentions related to suicide. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general distress and dissatisfaction with life but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or a plan. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it involves expressions of hopelessness without explicit suicidal thoughts. When in doubt, I choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness (""I see no point in living anymore""), isolation (""I don't have any friends""), and general dissatisfaction with life (""Nothing in my life is working out""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No emotional indicators like despair are tied to explicit suicidal content, and there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""I see no point in living anymore"" implies a vague dissatisfaction with life, it is not a direct expression. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so no need to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and general dissatisfaction, with no reference to past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it does not explicitly express suicidal content, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of guilt, feeling ""fucked up,"" and a specific action of taking ""a fuck load of pills"" with the implication of not waking up tomorrow. This mentions potential death or dying through overdose. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, guilt, and a sense of burden on others. There are no references to past attempts, but the focus is on a recent action. Specific plans or methods: Pills are mentioned as a method for self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, as indicated by ""might not wake up tomorrow"" after taking pills. Since it's implied through the described action, this leans toward being more than just vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (pills for overdose). There are signs of preparation or action taken, as the user states they have already taken the pills. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clear an action is described.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a very recent or current event (having taken the pills), with future implications (might not wake up). It does not describe past attempts but focuses on an action that has just occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action (taking pills) that constitutes a suicide attempt. According to the definitions, this fits 'Attempt' because it involves a past action (the ingestion of pills) that could lead to death. Even though it mentions current feelings, the core is the description of the attempt, so 'Attempt' is the best category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions suicide explicitly multiple times, such as ""I'm planning out my suicide"" and ""failing an attempt once again."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, like ""I'm tired of the constant struggle,"" ""can't find a reason to continue living,"" and ""silently reminisce with these feelings."" Specific plans are referenced, including a timeline (""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest"") and fear of past failure. There are references to a past suicide attempt (""failing an attempt once again"").
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, e.g., ""I can't find a reason to continue living"" and ""I will go through with this.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods (e.g., tools or substances), but a plan is indicated with a timeline (""by January 1st""). Signs of preparation include the act of planning and intent to avoid failure. Since there is mention of a plan, this leans toward 'behavior,' but I must consider the overall context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""failing an attempt once again"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I'm planning out my suicide"" and ""I have an intention... by January 1st"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and references a past attempt while also mentioning current plans. According to the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt.' Therefore, this fits 'attempt' based on the rule provided.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit expressions of not wanting to live, such as ""I do not want to live anymore,"" ""I am too scared to kill myself,"" ""I hate being alive,"" and ""I wonder if I should just do it now."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like wishing ""I was never born"" and concerns about burdening family.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""too scared to kill myself"" and ""if I should just do it now."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die?

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. The post expresses contemplation but lacks explicit planning, so I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (e.g., ""do it now"" or ""if I wait for later""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing how. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Behavior' due to no plan, or 'Attempt' due to no past actions.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user details how they perform these attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left.

There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for current or future actions, and no references to self-harm beyond the past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, e.g., ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" and ""it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post expresses frustration about the user's living situation (""I am 29 still live with my parents"") and includes a string of gibberish with words like ""fuckkkkkkkk"" and possible repetitions of ""die"" (e.g., ""didieiridodiodididodidook""). This suggests emotional distress or anger, but there are no clear mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? The gibberish may imply something like ""die,"" but it is unclear and not explicit. Following the rule to lean toward 'indicator' when unclear, this is treated as No.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to the user's current situation (e.g., living with parents at 29) with no indication of past events or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicide mentions and a plan, which could suggest 'behavior.' However, it also explicitly refers to past attempts (""I've done it many times"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""end it all"" and feelings of doom if continuing to exist), which fits the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan or method, so it's not behavior. It's not merely general distress without suicide mentions, so it's not indicator. No past attempts are mentioned, so it's not attempt.

140,"Just another rant. Keep scrolling. Don't waste your time on a lost cause. I'm almost 30. Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time. I am just a  Useless, shameless, pathetic loser. Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful. I am a useless piece of garbage. Oh wait, garbage can be recycled or made into something. My miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of past suicide attempts (e.g., trying to drown, hang, and jump from a building), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, depression, and anxiety. There are no mentions of current plans or methods for future actions, but it heavily focuses on past self-harm behaviors and ongoing distress.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through statements like ""Why should I still live"" and the descriptions of attempts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned in the context of past attempts (e.g., drowning, hanging, jumping from a building), but these are not presented as current preparations. Since they refer to past actions, this does not qualify as current planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events (e.g., ""I tried to drown myself""), with no explicit references to current or future intentions. It describes historical actions rather than ongoing plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. There are no indications of current plans, so it does not fit 'Behavior'. It goes beyond mere thoughts, ruling out 'Ideation', and it's not vague enough for 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of overwhelming pain, a reference to hiding suicidal thoughts, and a clear plan involving Trazodone (a medication) and alcohol to end life. There are mentions of death and dying, emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""the pain is too much""), specific methods (Trazodone and alcohol), and a timeline (be dead in less than 24 hours). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post directly implies ending life through the plan described.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like reaching a point where pain is too much and stating they will be dead soon.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, Trazodone and alcohol are specified as means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post mentions having enough Trazodone and planning to get alcohol today, indicating active preparation.
   - This clearly involves a plan, so it goes beyond ideation.

   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., getting alcohol today and being dead in less than 24 hours), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan with methods and preparations, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' due to the presence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as it describes future actions rather than past ones.

Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of ongoing hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life, such as ""Every year I think things are going to get better, and they don't,"" ""the rest is just darkness,"" ""I should be happy, but I'm not,"" ""I really am tired of my obsessive negative thoughts,"" ""I've been struggling since I was a child,"" ""Nothing makes sense anymore, I want to give up,"" ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show deep hopelessness and guilt, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted. References to past events include childhood struggles and past abuse, but not past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although phrases like ""I want to give up"" and ""Why the fuck am I alive"" suggest general despair, they do not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life. Given the rules, when in doubt, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and a vague sense of wanting to give up, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings expressed, and the rules specify to choose 'Indicator' when in doubt or when suicide is not explicitly mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of intent to die, such as ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" references to anorexia as a means to achieve this, specific weight goals (currently 90 pounds, new goal of 78 pounds or lower to kill themselves), and desires to ""look like a fucking skeleton when I die."" There are mentions of death and dying, emotional indicators of determination and hopelessness, and a specific method involving starvation through anorexia. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (anorexia and weight loss to a specific goal of 78 pounds or lower to cause death).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, as the person describes their current weight and sets a new goal, implying ongoing actions toward this end.
   - This involves a clear method, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""my new goal weight,"" ""I'm going to die""), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (anorexia as a method to end life), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not just ideation because a method is described, and it is not an attempt since no past action is mentioned.

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""suicide"" explicitly and asks about the possibility of using a charcoal BBQ in a tent as a method. This indicates a specific means (charcoal BBQ for likely carbon monoxide poisoning) and directly references suicide. There are no emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair expressed, no references to past attempts, and no signs of preparations.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, it's phrased as a question about possibility rather than a personal desire. However, the explicit mention of suicide leans toward recognizing it as more than just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies a method: using a charcoal BBQ in a tent.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there's no indication of actual preparations like acquiring items or writing a note.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this suggests explicit planning, which aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It appears to be about current or future possibilities, as it's a question about feasibility, not a past event.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and includes a specific method (charcoal BBQ in a tent), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a mentioned plan or method. Although there's no direct personal expression of intent, the specification of a method overrides 'ideation'. Based on the rules, when a specific method is described, it should be classified as 'behavior'.

146,"Life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it. I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way.

I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man.

My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough.

I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, self-loathing, and distress about body image, gender dysphoria, relationships, and overall life dissatisfaction. There are mentions of ""want to die"" and ""committing die"" (likely a typo for ""committing suicide"" or ""die""), which indicate thoughts of death. Emotional indicators include feelings of everything being wrong, not deserving anything, and believing others would be better off without the user. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""makes me want to die"" and ""committing die,"" which directly express a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user states ""want to die"" and implies others would be better off without them, indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - The language is explicit enough to go beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about notes, acquiring means, or other preparations is mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current feelings and thoughts, with no mention of past events, attempts, or future intentions beyond general distress.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""want to die""), fitting the definition of ideation, as there is a desire to not be alive but no specific plan or method. It is not just general dissatisfaction, so it's not indicator. There are no signs of planning or past attempts, so it's not behavior or attempt.

We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time.

I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional pain and distress, such as ""My heart hurts and I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying."" There are mentions of wanting to die and emotional indicators like hopelessness, despair, and feelings of worthlessness related to a relationship fight. No references to self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations are present. There are no mentions of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying"" indicate a desire to not be alive. Since these are direct expressions, this leans toward ideation, but if unclear, I would choose indicator; however, it's sufficiently explicit here.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and a recent event (the fight), with no mention of past events or attempts. It focuses on present emotional state and future uncertainty about the relationship.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It goes beyond general distress (as in Indicator) but lacks the elements of planning required for Behavior or a past attempt for Attempt.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses deep distress, including thoughts of wanting horrible things to happen to the user (e.g., sexual assault, having a disease), feelings of invalidation, confusion about past trauma, and a metaphor of being like a ""sick dog"" that needs to be ""put down."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, exhaustion, and despair (e.g., ""I can't do it anymore,"" ""I'm an abomination,"" ""Nothing's real to me anymore""). There are mentions of thoughts of hurting others (e.g., ""thoughts of hurting everyone,"" ""thrill of stabbing someone""), but not directly self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. No references to past suicide attempts, though possible past trauma is alluded to vaguely.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the metaphor of the ""sick dog"" needing to be ""put down"" implies a desire for ending suffering, it is not a direct expression. Since this is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around"" suggests a timeline for change, but it does not indicate any concrete plan or action. Since there is no explicit plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if it were to apply, but it doesn't here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily discusses current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ongoing distress), with vague references to possible past trauma (e.g., ""I feel like it may have happened to me before""). There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and metaphorical expressions of distress, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or specific plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions suicide multiple times, such as ""the thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" and ""suicide pact."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, including feelings of relief from thoughts, torment, tiredness, weakness, and a sense of being different or unable to connect. No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) are mentioned, but there is a reference to ""plotting"" and drafting a will, which could imply some preparation. No references to self-harm or past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""plotting my suicide"" and ""suicide pact.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through expressions of obligation to suicide and ongoing thoughts of it.
   - The mentions are clear, so this goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances are detailed; it's vague (e.g., ""plotting"" and drafting a will, but no concrete plans like acquiring a weapon or choosing a location).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Drafting a will might suggest preparation, but it's not explicit or detailed enough to confirm a full plan.
   - Since there's uncertainty about a specific plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing thoughts (e.g., ""plotting for months"" and present feelings), not past events or attempts. No historical actions are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires (e.g., feeling obligated to suicide), but lacks a specific plan or method, making 'ideation' the best fit. It doesn't qualify as 'behavior' due to the absence of detailed preparations, and there's no mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' doesn't apply. It's not just general distress, so 'indicator' is ruled out.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme anger, frustration, and exhaustion directed at another person (likely a parent or guardian). There are mentions of emotional indicators such as tiredness (""i'm so tired"", ""i have no more energy""), hopelessness about the world (""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED""), and accusations of abandonment and harm. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm by the poster. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not by the poster. The post expresses anger toward another person and wishes for ""peace"" if that person had not woken up, but this is not about the poster's own suicidal thoughts. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, or any form of planning related to suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., ""what they did"" to a child) and current feelings of tiredness and anger. It does not describe any past attempts or current/future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or plans.

152,"I don't want to kill myself, but. I have literally nothing going for me. I graduated college almost 2 years ago, and I still don't have a job. I pushed all my friends away. I barely leave the house anymore. All I want is to have a job so I can be a normal, functioning member of society. I just want to have a sense of purpose. I want to meet new people and go places. I'm so sick of sitting inside all day, waiting for the next day in hopes it will somehow be the day where everything changes. I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life. And at this rate, I really feel like nothing is going to change. It's been so stagnant for so long. Everyone I know has a great job, a great relationship, their own apartment; they're all moving forward in life, meanwhile I'm still sitting in the same house that I grew up in. I'm so sick of this. I've always been a melancholic guy, but I really want to give life a chance. I want to have financial independence, a girlfriend, hobbies, and see where it takes me. But it seems like the world rejects me at every turn. I've always prided myself on being a pretty tough and resilient person, but I've reached a point where I really don't know what's next for me. I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration, hopelessness, and isolation due to unemployment, social withdrawal, and lack of purpose. There are emotional indicators such as feeling stagnant, like nothing will change, and the walls closing in, which suggest despair. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in the form of denial (""I don't want to kill myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user expresses a desire to improve their life and give it a chance. Since the mention is not an expression of suicidal thoughts and leans toward negation, I am leaning toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but nothing here suggests even ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., graduating college, pushing friends away) and current feelings of stagnation, but there are no references to future intentions involving harm or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but no explicit suicidal thoughts or desires to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not mentioned in a way that indicates thoughts or feelings about it, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family but I know I shouldn't I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out . Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of overwhelming life difficulties, suicidal thoughts, and direct desires to die. Specifically, mentions of ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" and feelings of being weak and pathetic. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a small support system. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, substances, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes – terms like ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" and ""I want to kill myself"" directly reference suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes – phrases such as ""I want to die tomorrow"" and ""I want to kill myself"" express a clear desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No – there are no details about tools, substances, locations, or means (e.g., no mention of weapons, pills, or ropes).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, though ""I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" could imply vague intentions to contact people, but this does not constitute specific preparation like writing a note or acquiring means. Since it's uncertain if this qualifies as a plan, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions, such as ""I want to die tomorrow,"" rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die (e.g., ""I want to kill myself""), which go beyond general distress, so it is not 'indicator'. However, there is no specific plan or method mentioned, only a vague timeline (""tomorrow while my mom is out""), which does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'. Therefore, it best fits 'ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a detailed plan. If unsure about the plan, 'ideation' is chosen over 'behavior'.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions feelings of hopelessness and despair, such as ""useless life,"" ""dead inside,"" ""still sad,"" ""anhedonic,"" ""beyond saving,"" and ""good days make me feel sad."" There is a phrase ""yeet myself way too much,"" which is slang that could imply self-harm or wanting to end one's life, but it's vague and not clearly tied to death or suicide. No mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts are present. Emotional indicators include deep hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""yeet myself"" might indirectly suggest a desire to end one's life, but it is not a clear or direct expression. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.
   
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but since there's no indication of any plan at all, this doesn't apply here.
   
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and a past depressive episode, but the depressive episode is not described as a suicide attempt. There are no references to past attempts or future intentions beyond general despair.
   
5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post expresses general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and a vague implied desire (e.g., ""yeet myself""), but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or any plans. The guidelines emphasize that vague feelings about dying without explicit suicide mentions should be classified as 'indicator'. When in doubt, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Therefore, this fits best as 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration, failure, and hopelessness about life circumstances (e.g., potentially losing a job and license, moving back home, feeling like a loser, and isolation from friends). There are mentions of death and suicide: ""I tried to end it once before"" and ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded."" Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. References to past attempts: Yes, ""I tried to end it once before.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the reference to a past attempt and wishing it had succeeded. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" implies a desire for the past attempt to have ended their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no indications of current planning, this leans toward not being 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to past events (the attempt: ""I tried to end it once before"") and current feelings (wishing it succeeded), but no current or future intentions are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""I tried to end it once before""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. There are no current plans mentioned, so it doesn't qualify as 'behavior'. While there are suicidal thoughts in the current context, the defining element is the past attempt, making 'Attempt' the best fit.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to kill oneself) but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without planning.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?

Although not using explicit terminology, these are clear indicators of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and possible future intentions (e.g., ongoing defeat and questioning continuation), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to not continue living, but lacks any specific plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""attempting suicide"" multiple times, indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include regret, embarrassment, not being mentally stable, and wanting to ""rip my hair out"" (which could suggest self-harm ideation). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools or locations. References to past attempts: The post says ""I was so close to attempting suicide,"" but it does not describe a completed attempt; it implies a near-event that was averted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""attempting suicide"" and ""going through with attempting suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as it contrasts suicide with moving back home, implying a desire to end life as an alternative.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""attempting suicide""), indicating ideation. However, there is no specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not an attempt since no concrete past action occurred. It exceeds indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of any preparations.

It doesn't qualify as behavior due to the lack of explicit planning, and it's not an attempt since no concrete action occurred in the past. Therefore, ideation is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include repeated mentions of ""suicide,"" with the user expressing a desire for others to join them in committing suicide. Emotional indicators show desperation and a wish for companionship in death. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user directly asks others to suicide with them.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no explicit plan is described, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is making a present call for action, rather than describing past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which goes beyond general distress and fits the definition of ideation. However, there is no mention of a specific plan or preparations, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not an indicator due to the explicit suicide references, and it is not an attempt since no past actions are described.

166,"I want to kms but nothing is ready and I'm scared for some reason. Hello. I just got home from work and I really want to hang myself right now. I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to ""kms"" (kill myself), desires to hang oneself, putting a rope around the neck and practicing hanging, fear of failing and ending up in ICU, feelings of being a burden, and inability to stop thinking about suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and fear. Specific plans or methods mentioned: hanging with a rope as the method, and references to preparations like packing the apartment or resigning from a job (though not completed). There are signs of recent actions (practicing hanging) and ongoing thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I want to kms,"" ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., desires to end life and feelings of deserving it).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (hanging with a rope).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (practicing with the rope around the neck).
   - This goes beyond ideation as it involves actual behavior and partial execution.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to recent past events (just practiced hanging after getting home from work) and current/future intentions (wanting to try again now). The practicing could be seen as a partial past attempt, and it's combined with current plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts, a specific method (hanging), and recent self-harming behavior (practicing with the rope). It also refers to past actions and current plans, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category per the rules (""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'""). Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit over 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'.

I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead. Then he will survive, then he won't need to work out a way to keep two people afloat with only his job. He'll only need to focus on himself and I'll finally be at peace. I told him today. I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job.

I don't want to be here any more.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to die, suicidal thoughts, emotional distress such as sobbing, hopelessness, and feelings of failure. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""making me suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation""). Emotional indicators include despair, overwhelm, and a sense of being a burden. Specific plans or methods mentioned: The user references getting a gun as a potential method (""I've always thought I was going to get a gun""). There are no clear signs of preparations like acquiring means or writing a note, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""making me suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user mentions a gun as a method they've thought about. This constitutes a specific idea of how to commit suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, but the mention of a method aligns with planning elements.
   - Based on the guidelines, since specific ideas of methods are present, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers primarily to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I'm going to go through with it""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (gun), which fits the definition of 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning or ideas of methods. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the reference to a means, so 'behavior' is the best category.

I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and suicide, such as ""full intentions to end things"" and ""doesn't want me dead."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like feeling apathetic about existing, wanting to sleep to escape, and hoping someone might intervene. There are signs of a specific plan or preparation, as the user describes driving to the mountains with the intent to end things, which implies a location for the act. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""full intentions to end things,"" which directly imply suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in ""end things"" and the overall context of not wanting to live.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly (e.g., no tools or substances), but a location (mountains) is implied as part of the plan. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user drove to the mountains with full intentions, indicating preparation and action toward the plan.
   - Since there is evidence of preparation, this leans toward 'behavior,' but as per rules, if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation'; however, the description is clear enough.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to a recent or current event (just finished driving), with intentions that were impulsive but not fully executed. No past attempts are described; it's focused on the present.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a described plan/preparation (driving to a location with intent), which fits the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the action taken, but it's not a past attempt since no concrete action was completed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct mentions of readiness to die (""I'm ready to die""), setting a date for an event (""The date was set a while ago""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and dissatisfaction (""nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life"" and ""Fuck this world""), and references to preparations (""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"" and ""I'm strapped in and ready to go""). There are no explicit mentions of self-harm or past attempts, but the language suggests planning related to dying.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I'm ready to die"" and ""go out the way I want""). This qualifies as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not detailed (e.g., no mention of tools or substances), but there are signs of preparation (""The date was set a while ago,"" ""Preps being made,"" and ""I'm strapped in and ready to go""), which indicate a plan. Since preparations are mentioned, this goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past actions (setting a date) but focuses on current intentions and future actions (being ready and preparations being made). There are no references to past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die, along with mentions of preparations and a set date, which constitute a plan. This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it involves suicidal thoughts plus explicit planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to the direct expressions, not 'Ideation' because of the preparations, and not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

No explicit past attempts are described, only past thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""im gonna do it,"" ""im so ready to die""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""im so ready to die"").

3.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme exhaustion and despair, such as ""running on nothing but shear spite,"" and repeated desires to ""check out,"" which is a euphemism for suicide or ending one's life. There are mentions of suicide explicitly, with the user stating they have no moral problem with it. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, as they discuss spite as the only thing holding them back and that even spite has limits. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user directly references ""suicide"" and uses ""check out"" in the context of wanting to end their life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I really want to check out"" and ""how much I want to check out.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of carrying out suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is indicated. Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (e.g., wanting to check out now), but it does not describe past events or attempts. It's focused on the present state of mind.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to end one's life and no moral objection to suicide, which fits the definition of 'Ideation.'

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme emotional distress, such as ""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im in so much pain and i cant handle it anymore,"" ""i cant,"" ""im done,"" and a farewell message like ""thank you to the people i met thru this sub"" and ""i hope everyone finds something to live for."" There are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm, but phrases like ""im going to do it"" imply a possible intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""im going to do it"" and ""im done"" suggest a desire to end something, possibly life, but it is not clearly stated. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I must lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Therefore, this does not qualify as having a plan, and if uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but based on the explicitness doubt from step 2, it aligns more with 'indicator.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""im going to do it,"" ""im done""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post expresses general distress and dissatisfaction with life, but without explicit mentions of suicide or a clear desire to die. The guidelines emphasize choosing 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, so 'indicator' fits best.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct question about ways to kill oneself, expressions of stress, and feelings of hopelessness regarding future prospects. There are explicit mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""kill myself""). Emotional indicators include stress, the idea that suicide would be ""easier,"" and a sense of not seeing a future. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user implies it would be easier and questions why not.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user is asking for a ""mostly painless way"" but does not specify any tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this. Since no explicit plan is described, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., current stress and thoughts about suicide), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die and end life), but there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the definition of ""Ideation,"" as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing a plan. It does not qualify as ""Behavior"" due to the absence of explicit planning, and there are no past attempts, so ""Attempt"" is not applicable. It's not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses overdosing on pills as a method of suicide, describing its painful effects. It mentions death, dying, and suicide explicitly (e.g., ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing is not a peaceful way to die""). Emotional indicators include warnings about regret and physical suffering, suggesting awareness of distress. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations described from the writer's perspective, nor references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""commit suicide"" and descriptions of overdosing.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the writer is advising others, not expressing their own desires.
   - Since the mentions are not about the writer's own thoughts, and the rule emphasizes the writer's risk, this leans toward not being explicit for classification purposes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, overdosing on pills is detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, as this is not described in the context of the writer's actions.
   - This is general information, not the writer's plan, so it does not qualify as behavior for the writer.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to potential future scenarios for others, not the writer's past or intentions.
   - No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post lacks explicit expressions of the writer's own suicidal thoughts, desires, plans, or attempts. It is advisory and discusses suicide methods in general, not personally. Based on the rules, since there is no indication of the writer's suicide risk, it fits best as 'indicator'. When in doubt, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of future intent to ""do it,"" lack of motivation to live, and mental health issues. There are mentions of wanting to end life indirectly through phrases like ""im gonna do it in the future"" and ""ill do it when im fed up,"" which imply suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""i truly have no motivation to keep on living"" and the only reason to continue is not wanting to sadden family. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, such as ""im gonna do it in the future"" and ""ill do it when im fed up,"" which clearly indicate a desire to end one's life. Since this is somewhat unclear in terms of directness, I am leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions, but the context strongly suggests suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. The post only vaguely refers to future action without details, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions (""im gonna do it in the future"" and ""ill do it when im fed up""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses a desire to not be alive (""no motivation to keep on living"") without any specific plan, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It goes beyond general distress because of the explicit future intent, but since no plan is detailed, it's not 'Behavior.' It's not 'Indicator' due to the clear expressions of wanting to end life, and it's not 'Attempt' as there's no past action. Overall, 'Ideation' fits best.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of anger and resentment toward the user's parents for bringing them into a life of psychological torture and neglect. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, as the user describes feeling psychologically tortured due to parental actions. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses regret about existence but does not directly state a desire to end one's life. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no mention of any plans, tools, or preparations related to suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past and current feelings about the user's life and parents' actions, but it does not describe past suicide attempts or indicate future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as per the definition, which includes vague feelings of dissatisfaction with life without explicit suicidal references. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post are a description of a vivid nightmare involving foreign men committing mass murder in a school and breaking into the user's home, leading to a severe panic attack and ongoing anxiety. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm in relation to the user. Emotional indicators include terror, panic, and anxiety from the dream, but these are tied to the nightmare rather than personal suicidal thoughts. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts related to suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on fear and anxiety from a dream, with no indication of suicidal thoughts. Since there are no such mentions, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? The post describes violent methods in the dream (e.g., slicing people), but these are not in the context of the user's own actions or suicide. There are no signs of preparation for suicide. As there's no evidence of planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past dream and current anxiety, but there are no references to past suicide attempts or future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and anxiety from a nightmare but lacks any explicit mentions of suicide, desires to die, plans, or past attempts. This best fits the 'indicator' category, as it involves expressions of distress without suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress such as fear, despair, and a desire to end suffering. There are mentions of death and dying through phrases like ""end this suffering"" and references to self-harm with ""I've overdosed twice, once accidental once on purpose."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to believe there's nothing"") and a plea for strength. There are no specific plans or methods for future actions mentioned, but there is a clear reference to past attempts (the overdoses).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post describes an overdose ""on purpose,"" which implies a deliberate attempt to end life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""end this suffering"" and the context of the overdose.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post mentions overdosing as a method, but this is in reference to past events, not current or future plans. There are no signs of preparation for a new action. Since no explicit plan for the future is described, this does not elevate to 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events with ""I've overdosed twice,"" indicating historic actions. It also includes current expressions of distress and a vague desire for strength to ""do it,"" but these are not tied to specific future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (overdose on purpose), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Although there are elements of current suicidal thoughts, the defining feature is the reference to a concrete past action. The rules specify that descriptions of past attempts classify as 'Attempt,' and even if there's a hint of current distress, the past attempt takes precedence.

182,I thought I was getting better. for the past few weeks I've been happy just to be spending time with my partner without any bad days. I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again. I've run out of meds and I asked for an urgent refill a few days ago but my doctors/pharmacy never got back to me. I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user expressing recent improvement in mood, spending time with their partner, but now feeling suicidal again. They mention running out of medications and not receiving a refill, which is contributing to their low mood. Emotional indicators include feelings of hopelessness, fear of stressing their partner, and self-blame for hurting their significant other. There are mentions of suicide (""I'm suicidal again""), but no references to death, dying, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""I'm suicidal again"" directly references suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as ""I'm suicidal again"" implies a desire to not be alive.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, while they mention running out of meds, this is not described as part of a preparation for suicide, just a general issue.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings (""I'm suicidal again"") and recent events (past few weeks of improvement, running out of meds), but not to past attempts or future intentions specifically.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts, indicating 'ideation'. There are no specific plans or methods, so it's not 'behavior'. It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide reference, and it's not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress such as anxiety, hopelessness, worthlessness, and pain. There is a direct mention of wanting to die (""I want to die more than ever""), but no references to specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. There are no explicit mentions of self-harm or past suicide attempts, though phrases like ""Everytime I try I fail"" suggest general failures in life, not clearly a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""I want to die more than ever,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since there is no indication of planning, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""now I want to die more than ever""), rather than past events. While ""Everytime I try I fail"" could imply past efforts, it does not specify suicide attempts, so it does not qualify as a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die), but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because of the explicit mention of wanting to die, not 'Behavior' due to no planning, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of ""suicide by hanging,"" which is a method of suicide. There's also a statement about having ""already tied the noose,"" indicating preparation for self-harm. Emotional indicators include uncertainty and a plea for honesty, suggesting distress. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes). There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, as the user is inquiring about the experience of suicide by hanging and has prepared a noose, implying a desire to end their life (Yes).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ""suicide by hanging"" and the user states they have ""already tied the noose,"" which indicates preparation (e.g., acquiring means). This goes beyond mere thoughts and suggests active steps.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or imminent intentions, as the user describes having already tied the noose and is seeking information, rather than past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific plan/preparation (tying the noose), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It exceeds 'Ideation' due to the explicit preparation and fits the definition for 'Behavior' rather than 'Indicator' or 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and dying, such as ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die because of them."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair related to the user's self-perception as a ""pervert"" and their uncontrollable sexual feelings. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""Should I kill myself?"" 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die because of them.""
   - This is clear and explicit, so no need to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
   - Since there is no indication of a plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which fits the definition of 'ideation'. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, and it is not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses strong anger and hatred towards the user's dad and family, including a mention of past sexual assault by the grandfather. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""i hate everything."" The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" suggests a desire to end something, potentially life, but it's not explicitly tied to suicide, death, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past suicide attempts, though past trauma is noted.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wanna end it"" can be interpreted as a direct expression of wanting to end one's life, though it's somewhat implicit. However, given the instructions to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I must carefully assess this. It feels like an explicit desire but not crystal clear, so I'll note the potential ambiguity.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is present, if it qualifies for ideation, it would not escalate to behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post references past events (e.g., sexual assault), but the emotional expressions like ""i just wanna end it"" seem current. No past suicide attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes an expression that could be seen as a desire to not be alive (""i just wanna end it""), which aligns with Ideation as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. Although there's some doubt about explicitness, the phrase goes beyond general dissatisfaction and directly implies ending one's existence. Per the definitions, this fits Ideation rather than Indicator, as it expresses a desire to not be alive. There's no plan or past attempt, so Behavior or Attempt doesn't apply.

There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant.

And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the author's suggestion of ""going hobo"" as an alternative to suicide, references to past occasions where they felt like they couldn't cope, and descriptions of living as a vagrant (e.g., squats, begging). There are mentions of suicide in the context of others (""on the brink of suicide""), implying emotional distress or hopelessness in the past for the author, but no direct references to death, dying, or self-harm methods. Emotional indicators include feelings of not coping and dissatisfaction with life, but these are tied to past experiences and coping strategies rather than current suicidal thoughts. No specific suicide plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post mentions ""on the brink of suicide"" as a concept for others, but it is not directly expressed as the author's current or past personal desire. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the author describes past feelings of not coping but does not explicitly state a desire to die or end their life. Since this is not clearly explicit for the author, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned; instead, methods for vagrancy are described. There are no signs of suicide preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's no evidence of any plan, so it doesn't qualify.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers primarily to past events (past occasions of not coping and choosing vagrancy) and offers it as a future alternative, but not in the context of suicide intentions. No past attempts at suicide are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post lacks explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings for the author, despite mentioning suicide in a general sense. General dissatisfaction and past distress are present, but without direct suicidal mentions, it fits 'Indicator'. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions feelings of hopelessness, loneliness, addiction, regret, and a desire to ""end it."" There are references to emotional distress like ""I can't go on anymore,"" ""I fucked up my life,"" and ""I miss being happy."" It includes a statement about being drunk in the basement and planning to ""end it"" tonight, which implies suicidal intent. No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances beyond alcohol), self-harm descriptions, or past attempts are mentioned. Emotional indicators include despair and isolation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""end it"" in context suggests a desire to end one's life. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""then end it"" indicate a desire to not be alive. Since it's not fully explicit (e.g., no direct word like ""suicide""), but leans toward indication, I note the instruction to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear—however, the context makes it more than vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no mention of how to end it, just ""tonight""). 
   - Are there signs of preparation? There's a timeline (""tonight""), but no explicit preparations like writing a note or acquiring means. Since there's no clear specific plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and future intentions (""tonight I'm just gonna... and then end it""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""end it"" and ""I can't go on anymore""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without explicit planning. It's not 'Indicator' due to the direct expressions of wanting to end life, not just general distress. It's not 'Behavior' because no specific method or preparations are mentioned, and the rules direct to choose 'Ideation' if unsure. It's not 'Attempt' as there's no description of past actions.

   - Key elements: The post mentions specific substances (800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen) as potential means to end life. It includes a direct question about successfully ending life and personal details (short, male, 56 kg), which could relate to planning the effectiveness of the method. There are mentions of death and suicide through the phrase ""end my life."" Emotional indicators include despair, as the user is inquiring about a fatal outcome. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""end my life,"" which directly expresses a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user is asking if they can successfully end their life.
   - This is clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies 800mg codeine and ibuprofen as substances, which are potential methods for overdose.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user states they have access to these items, indicating possession and potential intent to use them. Personal details like weight may imply consideration of dosage effectiveness.
   - Since specific methods are mentioned, this goes beyond mere thoughts and suggests planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is asking about the success of an action they might take, rather than describing past events.
   - No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) and mentions specific methods (codeine and ibuprofen) with signs of preparation (access to substances). This aligns with the 'Behavior' category, as it involves explicit planning. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Ideation' because a specific plan is described, or 'Attempt' since no past action is referenced.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme hopelessness, failure, and despair. There are mentions of ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" and phrases like ""I can't do this anymore,"" ""I can't live like this for the rest of my life,"" and ""I can't stand being here any other moment."" These suggest a desire to end one's life, but there are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and suffering, with no specific plans, methods, or preparations noted. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""resisting the desire to end"" and ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" which imply a desire to not continue living. However, since the mention is not very explicit (e.g., no direct statement like ""I want to kill myself""), and the instructions emphasize leaning toward 'indicator' if unclear, I must consider this aspect carefully.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Are there signs of preparation? No. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but since no plan is present, this doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""everyday I ran out of reasons""), with implications of future intentions (e.g., ""I can't live like this for the rest of my life""), but it does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and a vague desire to end life, but lacks explicit mentions of suicide or a specific plan. Based on the definitions, this could lean toward Ideation due to expressions of not wanting to live. However, the rules state that if it's unclear whether suicide is explicitly mentioned, I should choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Given the vagueness (e.g., ""desire to end"" is not a direct mention of suicide), I must default to 'indicator' to follow the guidelines.

There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and distress, as the user is contemplating how to inform loved ones about their potential suicide. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""commit suicide"" is used directly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post expresses a probable intention to end one's life. Since it is explicit, this moves beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. As there is no indication of a specific plan, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to future intentions (""eventually""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a desire to commit suicide but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'ideation'.

There is a direct mention of suicide with the phrase ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself,"" which implies suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, isolation, and despair (e.g., ""I'm losing grip with it all,"" ""I can't cope,"" ""Why won't god talk to me?""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""end myself,"" which directly expresses a desire to end one's life. There are direct expressions of wanting to die via the voices urging self-ending. This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are mentioned. There are no signs of preparation, such as writing a note or acquiring means. Since there is no explicit plan, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past financial mistakes but focuses on current feelings of distress and suicidal thoughts. There are no descriptions of past attempts; it's about present intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""end myself""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of Ideation. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not Behavior because no plan is detailed, and not Attempt because no past actions are described.

193,"a hopeful thought. now that my abusive ex is gone maybe i can find someone who cares enough to look up ways to try to help me with my mental health stuff, or who asks me about how they can help, or who even asks me how i feel about things or my opinions and just. little caring things like that. i hope i can have that one day. and even if i'm by myself for the rest of the life, i can be okay. even if i'm not okay right now. maybe i don't need to die",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hope and a desire for support with mental health issues. There is a mention of ""mental health stuff"" and feeling ""not okay right now,"" indicating current distress. There is a vague reference to dying in the phrase ""maybe i don't need to die,"" but no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, death in a direct sense, specific plans, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators show a mix of hopefulness and dissatisfaction, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" is vague and implies a potential past thought rather than a current desire, but it's not direct. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plans, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but there's no evidence here to even reach that level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings (e.g., ""not okay right now"") and future hopes (e.g., ""i hope i can have that one day""), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post lacks any explicit mention of suicide or direct expressions of wanting to die, fitting the 'indicator' category. It includes general expressions of distress related to mental health and a vague hint of dying, but without explicit suicidal content, it defaults to 'indicator'. When in doubt, as here, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying (e.g., ""i dont wanna die rn"" and questioning if taking 3 Xanax pills can cause death). It includes emotional indicators like boredom leading to suicidal thoughts and a desire to be calm. There is a specific method mentioned (taking 3 Xanax pills) and an expression of intent (""i will do it anyway""). No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""suicidal thoughts are always there.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the acknowledgment of suicidal thoughts and the query about dying from pills, though phrased as ""i dont wanna die rn"" which expresses current reluctance but pairs with intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, taking 3 Xanax pills is specified as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is indication of intent (""i will do it anyway""), but no explicit details like acquiring pills or writing a note.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior,' but if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation'; however, the method is clear here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""i will do it anyway""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (3 Xanax pills), which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of a means and intent, so 'behavior' fits best.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses self-loathing, regret, and emotional distress about pushing away a friend, with mentions of feeling like a ""monster"" and ""piece of human garbage."" It includes a direct inquiry about self-harm locations (""places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"") and a statement about intending to ""kill myself"" if the friend is dead. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the intent to ""kill myself"" and the context of self-harm inquiry.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? There is an inquiry about self-harm locations, which relates to methods of harm but not explicitly to suicide methods (e.g., no tools, substances, or locations for suicide are detailed). No signs of preparation are evident.
   - Since this is not a clear specific plan for suicide, it leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (pushing away the friend) and current/future intentions (self-harm inquiry and waiting to kill oneself), but no past suicide attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself""), indicating a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan, methods, or preparations for suicide. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailed planning. There is no evidence of past attempts, so 'Attempt' does not apply. It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, and it's not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself soon,"" indicating suicide. Emotional indicators include strong feelings of hopelessness, such as ""I've been feeling a really strong urge to lately,"" ""the only people i have in my life dont care,"" ""They dont make any effort to keep me around,"" ""i just wish i wasn't even born,"" and ""life is fucking stupid,"" which express despair and dissatisfaction with life. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations, nor references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""Im probably going to kill myself soon.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""i just wish i wasn't even born.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is mentioned.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as indicated by ""going to kill myself soon"" and ""feeling a strong urge lately."" No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, making it best fit 'ideation'. It's not 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'behavior' without a plan, and not 'attempt' as it doesn't describe past actions.

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of temptation to end one's life, specifically by ""going to the highest floor and plummeting to the ground."" This mentions death and dying through references to becoming a ""corpse"" or potentially being ""crippled."" Emotional indicators include internal conflict, guilt, and fear about the consequences for others, suggesting despair and hopelessness. There are no mentions of self-harm directly, but the act described implies it. Specific plans or methods are referenced (jumping from a high floor), and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post expresses being ""tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground,"" which implies a desire to die.
   - Since there is a clear indication of wanting to die, even if not using the exact word, I am leaning toward recognizing it as more than just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies a method: going to the ""highest floor"" and ""plummeting to the ground,"" which describes a location (highest floor) and a means (jumping/falling).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs like writing a note or acquiring tools are mentioned.
   - Since a specific method is described, this goes beyond mere thoughts and indicates planning, so I am classifying it as involving a plan rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current temptations and future intentions (e.g., ""so tempted to just go""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and mentions a specific plan (method and location), which aligns with the ""Behavior"" category. It is not ""Indicator"" because there are direct expressions beyond general distress. It is not just ""Ideation"" due to the specific plan mentioned. It is not ""Attempt"" as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a hypothetical scenario where the user considers killing themselves to impact their boyfriend's feelings. There is a direct mention of ""kill myself,"" which is a reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include potential distress or manipulation in relationships, suggesting feelings of hopelessness or desperation. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""if I kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as it implies a desire to end one's life in a hypothetical context. Since this is explicit, it goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no explicit plan, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a hypothetical future or conditional action, not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or preparation. Therefore, it best fits 'ideation.'

This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include descriptions of standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage, attempting to build courage to jump, frustration that no one intervenes, and a reference to a past incident at the same hospital where someone else jumped. There are mentions of death and dying implied through the act of jumping, emotional indicators of hopelessness and a desire for care, and specific references to the method (jumping from a ledge) and location (hospital parking garage). No explicit preparations like writing a note are mentioned, but repeated visits to the site suggest some level of engagement.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through descriptions of trying to work up the nerve to jump, implying a desire to end life.
   - Since it's not explicitly stated but clearly implied, I lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt; however, the context strongly suggests suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, jumping from the ledge of a hospital parking garage is described as the method and location.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user mentions repeatedly going to the ledge, standing or sitting there for extended periods to build courage, which indicates some form of preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; here, the mention of a specific method and repeated actions makes it more than just thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing intentions (e.g., ""I'll stand there,"" ""Trying to work up the nerve""), with a reference to a past similar incident (""the last time""), but it's focused on present behavior rather than a completed past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to jump) and mentions a specific plan (method of jumping from a location with repeated preparations). This fits 'Behavior' as it involves both thoughts and an explicit plan, per the definition. It's not just 'Ideation' due to the specified method, and it's not 'Attempt' since no completed action is described. 'Indicator' doesn't apply because of the clear suicidal context.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include the user's long-term struggle with depression since 2nd grade, loss of parents, experiences of abuse, feelings of hopelessness, multiple past suicide attempts, current life difficulties (e.g., poor grades, job risk, arrest), and recent actions like searching for ways to kill themselves that look like an accident. There are explicit mentions of death, dying, and suicide, emotional indicators of despair and exhaustion, specific references to past attempts (e.g., using a phone charger), and indications of current preparations (e.g., searching for methods).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""my death seems the ultimate answer"" and searching for ways to kill oneself).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., past use of a phone charger and searching for ways to make death look like an accident).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., recent searches for methods, which indicate active consideration and potential preparation).
   - This goes beyond ideation, as there are indications of planning and past actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events (e.g., parents' deaths, past suicide attempts) and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing searches for methods and viewing death as a solution).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts and also mentions current plans (e.g., searching for ways to kill oneself). Based on the category definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and includes current plans, it fits the 'Attempt' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of emotional distress, such as feeling uncared for, betrayed, and emotionally drained. Phrases like ""more dead inside"" suggest a metaphorical sense of emotional numbness or despair, but there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and frustration, as seen in ""nobody cares about me,"" ""Im done being played with,"" and ""done with everything."" There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although ""more dead inside"" and ""done with everything"" imply emotional exhaustion, they are vague and not direct expressions of suicidal desires. Since this is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no indication of any plan, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but in this case, it doesn't even reach that level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to current feelings and frustrations rather than past events or future intentions. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, I choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions jumping off, specifically from a bedroom window, with details about trees and mud below to make it less scary. This implies a method of self-harm or suicide. Emotional indicators include building courage and hope to act soon, suggesting desperation and resolve. There are no mentions of death or suicide explicitly by name, but the context implies it. No references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) - The word ""suicide"" isn't used, but the post describes an action that implies ending one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) - Phrases like ""I think I can jump off"" and ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicate a desire to end life.
   - Since it's not fully explicit but leans toward indication, I would normally lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context suggests more than vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (Yes) - It specifies jumping from a bedroom window and notes features like trees and mud, which indicate a planned method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (Yes) - ""Getting more courage"" suggests mental preparation for the act.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, the specific method is clear, so it qualifies as planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions (""Hopefully I can do it soon""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to jump) and a specific plan (method of jumping from a window with details). According to the definitions, this fits 'Behavior' because it mentions a plan. It's not just ideation without a plan, nor is it an indicator due to the specificity, and it's not an attempt as it's future-oriented.

It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include the user's struggles with mental health, family pressures, reluctance to seek help, and expressions of depression. There are mentions of suicide through the phrase ""writing suicide notes,"" which indicates suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., feeling like they'd waste a therapist's time, depression hitting hard). No specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed beyond writing notes. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user references ""writing suicide notes.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the context of depression leading to writing notes, indicating a desire related to suicide.
   - This is not unclear, so it moves beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of writing suicide notes could imply some preparation, but it's not explicit or detailed enough to constitute a plan.
   - Since there's uncertainty about explicit planning, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or potential future intentions (e.g., what happens when depression hits), rather than past events. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., writing suicide notes), fitting the definition of 'ideation' as it involves a desire related to suicide without a specific plan. It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' due to the lack of detailed planning, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., hoping to die), which rules out 'indicator.'

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in the post ""Ah. Just cut to deep fuck"" include a possible reference to self-harm, as ""cut to deep"" might mean cutting oneself too deeply, which is often associated with self-injury. There are emotional indicators of distress or frustration, evident in the exclamation ""Ah"" and the word ""fuck."" However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts. It appears to express immediate pain or regret rather than broader suicidal content.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post implies self-harm but does not explicitly state a desire to end one's life. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? There is a vague reference to ""cut,"" which could imply a method like cutting with a blade, but it is not detailed or specific (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances are named). There are no signs of preparation. Since this is uncertain and does not clearly indicate a plan, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but overall, it doesn't meet the threshold for ideation due to lack of explicit suicidal thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This seems to refer to a current event rather than past or future intentions. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general distress through self-harm implications but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' because there is no explicit expression concerning suicide, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over other categories.

""you have to live for everyone else!"" like OH MY FUCKING GOD YOU ARE SO HILARIOUS AND PATHETIC. As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice lmao. They only do that so they can feel good about themselves. ""Ah I'm such a good person"" they say to themselves. You're not. You're an attention hungry piece of shit that feeds off the misery of others",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration, anger, and sarcasm towards people giving unsolicited advice, such as ""don't do it!"" or ""you have to live for everyone else."" There are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show distress through words like ""tired,"" ""fucking bullshit,"" and ""pathetic,"" indicating general dissatisfaction and annoyance, but not explicit hopelessness or despair tied to suicide. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post references what others say (e.g., ""don't do it""), which might imply suicide indirectly, but it's not expressed by the user. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings of frustration but does not mention past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and dissatisfaction but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, or feelings. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator' as there are no direct indications of suicidal content, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over other categories.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of confusion and emotional distress, such as ""i kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time,"" indicating a desire to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., struggling to get up, finding everything boring), isolation (e.g., friends leaving, getting bullied, stopping school attendance), and general dissatisfaction with life (e.g., poor grades, uncertainty about what to do). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user states ""i kinda just wanna die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""wanna die."" This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plan is evident, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions, such as ongoing struggles and present desires, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), which fits the definition of 'ideation.' There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention of wanting to die, and it is not 'attempt' as no past actions are referenced.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions suicidal thoughts, wanting to justify dying, anxiety, depression, nihilism, and self-destructive tendencies. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as feeling terrible every day and increased thoughts over the past few months. It also touches on ""partially planning to die"" and being impulsive, but no specific methods, tools, or preparations are detailed. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""thinking about partially planning to die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, only a vague reference to not having ""strong and reliable methods"" and being impulsive, without detailing any tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, just the idea of ""partially planning,"" which is not concrete enough to indicate actual preparation.
   - Since there's no clear specific plan, I should lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the instructions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and ongoing thoughts and feelings, with no mention of past events or attempts; it's focused on the present escalation of thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which rules out 'indicator'. There are no specific plans or methods described, so it doesn't qualify as 'behavior'. It's not about past attempts, so 'attempt' doesn't apply. Therefore, it best fits 'ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a detailed plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of extreme distress from job loss, financial instability, isolation, past abuse, and hopelessness. There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically the user stating they are ""better off dead"" and describing a plan to end their life. Emotional indicators include despair, worthlessness, and exhaustion with life. Specific plans or methods mentioned: driving to the mountains, hiking off paths, and hanging themselves. There are no references to past suicide attempts, though past fears of suicide are noted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""better off dead"" and ""find a nice little spot to hang myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""no reason to keep going"" and the overall desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging is explicitly stated as the method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post describes a detailed plan including driving to the mountains and hiking to a location, which indicates a specific method and location, though no concrete preparations like acquiring tools are mentioned.
   - Since a specific method is outlined, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions, as the user discusses recent events (job loss) and ongoing thoughts (""i've been thinking I could just drive...""). There are no descriptions of past attempts, only past fears.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (method of hanging and location in the mountains), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a plan, so 'behavior' fits best. If there were no plan, it might be 'ideation,' but the details provided make it clear.

   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore,"" which directly express a desire for death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""I don't enjoy anything,"" ""I am lonely,"" ""I am not healing,"" and ""It is terrible."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore.""
   - Although the term ""suicide"" is absent, the expressions of wanting to die are clear indicators of suicidal thoughts, so this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is mentioned.
   - Since there is no evidence of planning, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, as the language is in the present tense (e.g., ""I want to be dead""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses explicit desires to not be alive (e.g., ""I want to be dead""), which fits the definition of ideation: explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general distress, so it's not indicator. There's no plan or preparation, so it's not behavior. No past attempts are described, so it's not attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of ongoing distress, frustration with mental health efforts, and explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts. The user describes maintaining healthy habits (e.g., working out, sleeping, eating well, therapy, medication), yet still feels ""unbelievably suicidal"" and deals with constant suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, exhaustion, and lack of motivation. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, self-harm preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly states ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""unbelievably suicidal"" and the overall desire for relief, indicating a wish for the thoughts to end.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (e.g., ""unbelievably suicidal""), fitting the definition of 'ideation' as it involves a desire related to not wanting to continue in this state without any specific plan. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'behavior' due to the absence of plans or preparations, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair related to mental health and daily functioning, but nothing specific to suicidal thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on distress from depression and anxiety without any reference to suicide, so I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include watching crime videos on YouTube that give ideas, suppressing suicidal thoughts, and specifically referencing a video about a woman using eye drops to kill her husband, which gives the user an idea for a new suicide method. Emotional indicators include distress, as the user expresses trying to suppress thoughts, sighing, and wishing they weren't like this. There are mentions of suicidal thoughts and a potential method (eye drops), but no references to past attempts or explicit preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and an ""idea of a new suicide method.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the discussion of suicidal thoughts, though they note trying to suppress them.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user references eye drops as a potential method inspired by the video.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring items or writing a note, but the mention of a specific method (eye drops) indicates a potential plan.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with the criteria for 'behavior' rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current thoughts and intentions, as the user is discussing ongoing suicidal thoughts influenced by recent videos, rather than past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, as well as a mention of a specific method (eye drops), which qualifies as explicit planning under the 'behavior' definition. It goes beyond vague ideation by detailing a method, so 'behavior' is the best fit. If there were no specific method mentioned, it might be 'ideation,' but the rules specify to classify as 'behavior' when a method is indicated.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of suicide (e.g., writing a suicide note, planning to end life), self-harm indicators (e.g., sabotaging oneself from following through), and emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair (e.g., feeling like the common denominator in problems, desire for calm through suicide, frustration at not being able to ""free"" oneself). There are references to preparations (writing and readying a suicide note for posting), specific plans (picking a time and place), and hints of future intentions (coaxing the feeling back and possibly acting on it).
   - No explicit methods like tools or substances are detailed, but preparations and planning are noted.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""planned everything out,"" ""do it this time"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., desire to free oneself from problems via suicide, reflecting on past planning with intent).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods (e.g., no tools or substances), but specific plans are described (e.g., picking a time and place, writing and preparing a suicide note for posting).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., writing the note and having it ready).
   - Since there is clear mention of planning, this leans toward 'behavior'; I am not uncertain, so I don't default to 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (a month ago: writing the note, planning, but sabotaging oneself) and current/future intentions (e.g., trying to coax the feeling back and implying action ""this time"").
   - No past attempts are specifically described as concrete actions (e.g., no overdose or similar), only preparations that were not followed through.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a plan (e.g., time, place, and preparations like the suicide note), which aligns with 'behavior'. It goes beyond mere ideation by including details of planning, even if from the past, and hints at current intentions. It's not 'indicator' due to explicit suicide references, not 'ideation' due to the presence of planning, and not 'attempt' since no concrete past action occurred (only thwarted preparations).

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him?

   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through descriptions of feeling empty, the futility of daily activities, and a lack of fear of death.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned; it's all about thoughts and feelings.
   - References to past attempts: No references to any past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" and ""suicide is selfish.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""it would be better if I was dead"" and ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please.""
   - The mentions are clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items.
   - Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""I often feel that...""), with no reference to past events or attempts; it's focused on ongoing ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

218,"Hotline where they can't track me or call the police to come to me?. Last time I called a hotline just to have someone to talk to (didn't have a method or anything), I ended up having the cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward for 3 days. It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's inquiry about a hotline that won't track them or involve the police. They reference a past experience where calling a hotline led to police intervention and a 3-day stay in a psych ward, which they say made them ""10x more suicidal."" There are mentions of suicide through the phrase ""made me 10x more suicidal,"" indicating emotional distress, worry, and paranoia. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are no references to past suicide attempts, only to past suicidal feelings triggered by the psych ward experience.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""made me 10x more suicidal."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the reference to increased suicidal feelings in the past, but not as a current desire. Since this is explicit about suicidal thoughts, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or plans, so this does not qualify as behavior. If uncertain, I would choose ideation over behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to a past event (the psych ward stay and resulting suicidal feelings) but expresses current worry and paranoia. It does not describe past attempts, only past increased suicidal thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""made me 10x more suicidal""), which fits the definition of ideation, as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned. It is not merely general distress, so it's not indicator. There are no signs of current or past planning or attempts, ruling out behavior or attempt.

219,This is not right. I dont want to live anymore. I just want be by myself.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of not wanting to live anymore, which implies a desire to die. There are emotional indicators of distress and isolation, such as ""This is not right"" and ""I just want be by myself."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the phrase ""I dont want to live anymore."" Since this is a direct expression of a desire not to be alive, it qualifies as an explicit indicator of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no mention of any plan or method, this does not rise to the level of behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This appears to refer to current feelings and intentions, rather than past events. There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not be alive) but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' because there is a direct expression of wanting to die, and it is not 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' due to the absence of plans or past actions.

Then they'll say 'oh why didn't he ask for help' BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT YOU SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE. Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal"" and phrases like ""ended it silently"" and ""until I die"", which relate to suicide and death. Emotional indicators include anger, frustration, hopelessness (e.g., ""I'm trying to hold on to whatever the hell I have left"", ""I still need help"", ""They don't care""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through words like ""suicidal"" and ""ended it silently"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly via the context of responding to accusations of attention-seeking and expressing that people won't believe until ""I die"", indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - Since it's explicit, this leans toward 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this fits 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and frustrations, with no specific past attempts mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., referencing being suicidal and the implications of ""until I die"") but lacks any specific plan or method, making it 'ideation'. It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'behavior' due to no plan, and not 'attempt' due to no past actions described.

Im sad to say this might be my final good bye. ill miss my family they've always taken care of me but there's only so much to be done.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses deep loneliness, tiredness, and frustration about not finding love. It mentions ""i feel like killing myself every day,"" which directly references suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and sadness about disappointing experiences. Specific plans or preparations are noted: ""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done."" There are references to past efforts like ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance,"" but no explicit description of a past suicide attempt.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Yes, with phrases like ""killing myself,"" ""suicide note,"" and ""final good bye.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident throughout.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, preparations include a suicide note and handling affairs like bills and testament.
   - References to past attempts: Indirectly, through ""ive wrote here before,"" but not a clear description of a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""suicide note"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""i feel like killing myself every day"" and ""this might be my final good bye"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods like tools or substances, but preparations are described (e.g., suicide note, bills, testament).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post states ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done,"" indicating active preparations.
   - Since preparations are mentioned, this goes beyond mere thoughts, suggesting a plan, so it aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions (e.g., ""i feel like killing myself every day,"" ""this might be my final good bye""), with vague references to past efforts but no concrete past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"") and mentions preparations (suicide note, etc.), which qualify as a plan. This fits 'behavior' as it involves both expressions of suicidal desires and explicit planning/preparations. It's not just ideation since a plan is indicated, and it's not an attempt because no past action is described as having occurred.

I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting.

I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of overwhelming distress, inability to confide in others, ongoing self-harm (e.g., ""I can't stop cutting""), and direct references to suicide (e.g., ""I'm going to kms,"" ""I'm about to kms""). There are mentions of death and dying through phrases like ""I'm going to kill myself very soon,"" indicating hopelessness, isolation, and despair. Specific plans are not detailed, but self-harm is ongoing, and there's an implied intent without explicit methods or preparations. No references to past suicide attempts are present, only past efforts to seek help that failed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kms"" means kill myself, and phrases like ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I'm about to kms,"" ""I finally accepted the fact that I'm going to kill myself very soon"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, indirectly through ""I can't stop cutting,"" which is a form of self-harm, but no other tools, locations, or substances are specified for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs like acquiring means or writing a note, though the intent is expressed.
   - Since there's no detailed plan but self-harming behavior is exhibited, this leans toward 'behavior' as per the definition, but if unsure about planning, I would choose 'ideation'; however, the presence of self-harm qualifies it as more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself very soon,"" ""I'm about to kms""), with mentions of past failed attempts to seek help, but no description of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die) and exhibits self-harming behavior (e.g., cutting), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It does not fit 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, 'ideation' because of the self-harm element, or 'attempt' as there are no descriptions of past completed attempts. Based on the definitions, 'behavior' is the best fit.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of wanting to kill oneself, references to a suicide note that was written and discarded, expressions of anger and resentment towards family, and desires to proceed with suicide to impact others. There are clear indicators of death and suicide (e.g., ""wanna kill myself"", ""killing myself"", ""shoot myself"", ""my death""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, defiance, and a sense of burden (e.g., ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"", ""I don't care""). Specific plans or methods mentioned: ""shoot myself on the spot"" indicates a method (shooting). Preparations: A suicide note was written and found, suggesting prior preparation. No direct references to past attempts beyond the note.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""wanna kill myself"", ""suicide notes"", ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"", ""shoot myself on the spot"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""shoot myself on the spot"" refers to using a gun as a method).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (e.g., writing and discarding a suicide note indicates preparation).
   - Since specific methods and preparations are present, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to recent past events (e.g., the intervention, finding the suicide note) and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing desires to kill oneself and the hope that family feels the burden). No explicit description of a completed past attempt, only preparation like the note.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, along with specific methods (shooting) and preparations (suicide note), which align with the 'behavior' category. It exceeds 'indicator' due to explicit mentions and goes beyond 'ideation' because of the plan. It's not 'attempt' since no concrete past action (like an overdose) is described, only preparation.

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of planning to overdose (OD) today, specific medications (venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh, and inderal), emotional indicators of numbness and hopelessness (""I can't feel anything right now and it's all I can think about""), and ongoing thoughts of suicide. There are direct references to suicide and a desire to end life by taking all pills at once. No past attempts are explicitly described, only thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user states, ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""Think I'm going to OD today"" and ""hope for the best"" after taking the pills, indicating a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user details overdosing on a month's worth of specific prescription drugs.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, they mention having the medications and considering taking them all at once, which implies access to means.
   - Since a specific method is described, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""Think I'm going to OD today""), not past events. While they mention thinking about suicide in the past, no actual past attempts are detailed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (overdosing on named medications), which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It exceeds 'ideation' due to the mention of methods and preparations, and it's not about past actions, so it's not 'attempt'. 'Indicator' does not apply as suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness and exhaustion (""I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up""), apologies and thanks to loved ones, and the phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now,"" which implies a desire for life to end. There are emotional indicators of despair and regret, but no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" suggests a desire for life to end, though it is indirect.
   - Since this is somewhat unclear and not a direct mention, I am leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but based on the lack of explicitness, this doesn't escalate to ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""feels right now""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and a vague implication of wanting ""the end,"" but without explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, I must choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There are no plans or past attempts, so 'behavior' or 'attempt' do not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of extreme distress, mentioning being ""suicidal and depressed,"" feeling overwhelmed, and a desire to ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat."" It includes mentions of suicide and self-harm (cutting throat), emotional indicators like hopelessness and being unable to cry, but no specific preparations or past attempts are detailed.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, suicide is mentioned (""I was already suicidal"") and self-harm is implied (""cutting my god damn throat"").
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling terrible and overwhelmed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, a method is mentioned (cutting throat), but no explicit preparations like acquiring tools.
   - References to past attempts: No, it refers to a current state of being suicidal without describing any past actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""I was already suicidal.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like wanting to ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat.""
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cutting my throat"" indicates a specific method (self-harm leading to suicide).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, no mentions of notes, tools, or other preparations.
   - Since a specific method is described, this aligns with the rule to classify as 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I feel so bad,"" ""all I want to do is...""), not past events. No past attempts are specified.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (cutting throat), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as per the definition. It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a way to commit suicide, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of ""suicide"" in the title and a quoted phrase about ""want to kill yourself."" There are no emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair from the user themselves. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present; it's just a discussion of a quote.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used, and the quote references ""want to kill yourself."" However, these are not direct expressions of the user's own desire to die; it's about an external quote. Since the user is not personally expressing suicidal thoughts and the risk must correspond to the person writing the post, this leans toward 'indicator' as per the rules.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are mentioned. The post is purely descriptive of a quote.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a recent event (stumbling upon a quote), but it does not indicate past events, current intentions, or future plans from the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post mentions suicide explicitly through a quote, but there is no indication that the user is expressing their own suicidal thoughts, feelings, or desires. Based on the definitions, this lacks a personal explicit expression of suicidal ideation, so it fits best as 'Indicator.' When in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The user expresses a desire to ""leave earth,"" states they are not happy, mentions having BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) which makes life difficult, describes an endless loop of negative life events, and says they ""always end up wanting to die."" They also mention being ready to ""join my dog,"" implying a desire to die to reunite with a deceased pet. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, giving up, and acceptance that life won't improve. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user directly says ""wanting to die"" and phrases like ""i want to leave earth"" and ""ready to join my dog"" indicate a desire to end their life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements such as ""wanting to die,"" ""i can't do this anymore,"" and the overall theme of giving up on life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items for self-harm is mentioned. Since no plan is evident, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers primarily to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""i'm not happy anymore,"" ""now i'm ready to join my dog""), with mentions of repeated patterns in life, but no specific description of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as wanting to die, which fits the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not merely general distress, as suicide is explicitly referenced, ruling out indicator. There are no descriptions of past attempts, so attempt does not apply.

He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs are present.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past decision (previously made up mind to kill oneself) and current reflections, but not a past attempt or ongoing preparation. It's about thoughts that were future-oriented but not acted upon.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I was going to kill myself""), indicating a desire to die, but without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' due to the lack of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past action occurred.

230,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of ""serious thoughts about suicide,"" researching ""easy painless ways to kill myself,"" family conflicts, feelings of being unappreciated, social anxiety, and seasonal depression. There are clear emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and anger from family dynamics. The user questions if they're faking their depression, which adds to the distress. Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: Yes, suicide is explicitly referenced multiple times. Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident in the ongoing thoughts triggered by family fights. Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user mentions researching ways to kill themselves, which implies thinking about methods but doesn't detail specific tools, locations, or actions. References to past attempts: None; it's focused on current thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""serious thoughts about suicide"" and ""want to commit suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements about suicidal thoughts and researching ways to end life.
   - This is clear, so it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The user mentions researching ""easy painless ways to kill myself,"" which indicates consideration of methods but doesn't specify details like tools, substances, or locations. This is more general research than a concrete plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as writing a note or acquiring means; it's just thoughts and research.
   - Since this doesn't clearly constitute a specific plan, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' if uncertain, this fits ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to recent and ongoing events (e.g., thoughts in February and current triggers from family fights), not past attempts. There's no description of a completed action, only current ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to commit suicide and researching ways), but lacks a specific plan or preparations. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as defined. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no clear plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

231,Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being. Death and suicide need to be normalized,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of life being useless, a desire for a better state on the other side (without thoughts, emotions, hunger, body, or mind), and a call to normalize death and suicide. There are mentions of death and suicide, indicating hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly states ""Death and suicide need to be normalized."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the description of life as useless and something better on the other side, which implies a desire for non-existence, though not in first-person terms.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plans or methods are detailed, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to general thoughts and future conceptual ideas (normalizing death and suicide) rather than past events or specific current/future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses thoughts about death as preferable, fitting the definition of Ideation (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). It goes beyond general distress, as suicide is directly referenced, so it's not Indicator. There's no plan, so it's not Behavior, and no past attempt, so it's not Attempt.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include romanticizing the thought of death as beautiful, expressing a desire to never feel pain or deal with life's hassles, and describing a state of being ""nothing in a black sea of infinity"" and letting go after holding on. There are mentions of death and a vague appeal to non-existence, but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include a sense of hopelessness and escape from pain, but nothing about past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post implies a desire to escape pain and exist in nothingness, which could suggest not wanting to be alive, but it is not direct or explicit—it's poetic and vague. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but based on the lack of explicit suicide mentions, it's not even at the ideation level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current thoughts or general feelings rather than past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general dissatisfaction and a vague feeling about death, but there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to kill oneself. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because it lacks explicit expressions concerning suicide, and when in doubt, I must choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There are no elements of plans, preparations, or past attempts, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' do not apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and death, such as ""I'll kill myself,"" ""committing suicide,"" and ""use any method I can as long as I don't see another day."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, isolation, and a lack of will to live, with phrases like ""my will to live is hanging by a thread,"" ""I'm so fucking tired,"" and feelings of being an outcast. There are no specific plans or methods detailed beyond a vague reference to ""any method,"" and no mentions of preparations like tools or notes. No references to past attempts are present; the focus is on current feelings and conditional future actions based on COVID results.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct statements like ""I'll kill myself"" and ""committing suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I used to be afraid of death but not anymore"" and expressions of no longer wanting to live.
   - This is clear, so it goes beyond just indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are detailed; only a vague statement like ""use any method I can"" is present, which does not constitute a specific plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of acquiring means or making preparations.
   - Since the plan is not explicit or specific, I should lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions, particularly conditional on COVID results (e.g., ""if I'm positive, I'll kill myself""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a specific plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""kill myself"" repeated multiple times. Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, and feelings of being a burden and disappointment. Specific methods are mentioned, like taking an entire bottle of zopiclone, which is a substance for overdose. There are references to a past attempt, as the user describes trying to kill themselves but failing.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""kill mslef.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as wanting to ""stop being a burden and a disappoinment.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user mentions taking an entire bottle of zopiclone, which is a specific substance for self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The description of taking the bottle implies preparation for the attempt, though no new preparations are detailed for future actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event (the failed attempt with zopiclone) and current/future intentions (asking ""What shoul i do kill mslef,"" indicating ongoing suicidal desires).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (overdose on zopiclone), which directly fits the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans or desires, but according to the rules, if a post refers to past attempts, it should be labeled as 'Attempt' even with current elements. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit over 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I might kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as it implies a potential desire to end one's life. This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., being made fun of in school) but focuses on current feelings of distress and a vague future intention (""I might kill myself""). No past attempts are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of struggling with depression, a direct statement of intent to ""end it tonight,"" specific methods mentioned (taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil), and phrases like ""Goodbye world"" and ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in phrases like ""I'm going to end it tonight"" and ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil, which are substances for overdose. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the timing (""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes"") implies immediate preparation. Since this includes specific methods, it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a specific plan with methods and timing, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' because of the detailed plan, and not 'Attempt' as it describes future actions rather than past ones.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""i want to kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide and wanting to die. Emotional indicators include physical discomfort, misery, and frustration from not remembering past events. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts; it's focused on current distress related to forgotten past misery.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""i want to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the same phrase indicates a desire to die.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like notes or acquiring means is mentioned.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the instructions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (last year's misery and inability to remember) and current feelings (wanting to kill oneself due to discomfort). However, it does not describe any past suicide attempts, only past emotional state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""i want to kill myself""), indicating a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post includes key elements such as explicit mentions of suicide (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end myself""), death (e.g., ""I deserve to die""), and self-harm intentions. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and feelings of unworthiness (e.g., ""life is sending me the message that I should die,"" ""I'm not deserving of love or even fun""). There are references to a specific plan (e.g., ending life on birthday in two weeks) and a past attempt (e.g., ""first failed attempt in October""). No specific methods, tools, or preparations are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I deserve to die and suffer while doing so"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, substances, or means are described, though a timeline is given (on birthday in two weeks). Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs like notes or acquiring means. Since no specific method is outlined, this leans toward ideation, but the presence of a past attempt influences the overall category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (failed attempt in October) and current/future intentions (plan to end life in two weeks).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions a past suicide attempt, which fits the 'Attempt' category. According to the rules, if a post refers to past attempts, even with current plans, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. Therefore, despite elements of ideation and potential behavior, the presence of a described past attempt takes precedence.

Thanks to all of you that helped me survive to this moment.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses celebrating one month since the user's last suicide attempt, the absence of current suicidal thoughts, occasional thoughts about death without intent, a positive shift in mental state after realizing a toxic relationship, ongoing depression for 2 years that has improved, and gratitude to supporters.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, there is a mention of a past suicide attempt and thinking about death, but it's not linked to current self-harm or suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The tone is mostly positive, with expressions of relief, improvement, and good feelings, though it references past depression.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, the user explicitly refers to ""my last suicide attempt.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as a past event.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user states that suicidal thoughts are gone and they only think about death without acting on it.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is clear, as it's about a past attempt, not current thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No uncertainty here, as there's no planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It primarily refers to a past suicide attempt and current positive state, with no indications of future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the user mentions ""one month from my last suicide attempt.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. There are no current suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors mentioned, so it doesn't fit 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. It's not vague or general, so 'Indicator' is not appropriate.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress such as frustration, tears, inability to sleep, guilt, tiredness, and being scared. There are mentions of ""awful thoughts"" and a statement that the person doesn't have a plan to hurt themselves, indicating possible internal struggles but no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as seen in phrases like ""I can't take it anymore"" and ""drowning in these awful thoughts."" No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although ""awful thoughts"" could imply suicidal ideation, it is not explicit. Since it is unclear and not directly stated, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No, and the post explicitly states ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there is no indication of any plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mentions of suicide, desires to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me.

I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of hating life, fear of dying, and a strong desire to die, as seen in phrases like ""I want to die or reverse time"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day."" There are mentions of death and dying, emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, and worry about wasting time or future events. The user also describes imagining self-harm (e.g., amputating body parts and burning themselves) but does not mention acting on it. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are detailed. There is a reference to past hospitalization for depression in high school, but it is not explicitly described as a suicide attempt.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through direct expressions like ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user clearly states a desire to die.
   - Since these are explicit, this leans toward Ideation rather than Indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plans for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is mentioned.
   - Since there is no evidence of explicit planning, this does not qualify as Behavior; it remains at the level of Ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to both past events (e.g., hospitalization for depression in high school) and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing thoughts of dying and imagining self-harm). However, the past hospitalization is described as for depression, not as a specific suicide attempt, so it does not directly qualify as an ""Attempt"" category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not Behavior due to the absence of plans, and not Attempt as no concrete past suicide action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of emotional pain, depression, physical symptoms from emotional distress (e.g., aching muscles, exhaustion), and a sense of the body giving up.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There is a mention of ""hoping I will die in my sleep tonight,"" which refers to dying but does not explicitly mention suicide or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident through descriptions of emotional and physical hurt, depression, and exhaustion.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned; there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any steps toward ending life.
   - References to past attempts: None are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) The post does not use the word ""suicide"" or directly state an intent to end one's life through self-inflicted means.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) The phrase ""hoping I will die in my sleep tonight"" expresses a desire to die, though it implies a passive wish rather than an active plan.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the desire to die is expressed, it is not explicitly tied to suicide, but the direct wish for death leans toward ideation based on the overall context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) No tools, substances, locations, or methods are referenced.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) There are no indications of any preparations, such as writing a note or acquiring means.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current emotional and physical states and expresses a hope for death tonight, indicating current feelings with a future-oriented wish.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? (No) No references to past suicide attempts are made.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""hoping I will die in my sleep""), which fits the definition of ideation as it involves suicidal thoughts or feelings without a specific plan. It is not an indicator because of the direct expression of wanting to die, nor is it behavior due to the absence of any plan or preparations, and it is not an attempt as no past actions are described.

243,"Zoloft overdose. So at 11:30 I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg and It obviously wasn't enough to kill me, I feel completely fine now apart from slight nausea and I'm really sweaty, will I be okay if I don't go to hospital?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a description of taking an overdose of Zoloft (6 pills, equivalent to 300mg), references to it not being enough to kill the user, physical symptoms like nausea and sweating, and a question about safety without hospital. There are mentions of death (implied by the intent to kill via overdose) and self-harm (overdose as a method). Emotional indicators are minimal, but there's concern about survival. Specific methods are mentioned (Zoloft pills and dosage), and this describes an action taken rather than just thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the overdose is described with the intent ""to kill me."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied through the action and statement about it not being enough to kill.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Zoloft overdose with exact dosage). Signs of preparation include taking the pills at a specific time (11:30). This describes an action that has occurred, but since it's not about future plans, it aligns with past behavior rather than ongoing preparation. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here it's clear an action was taken.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a past event (taking pills at 11:30) and current symptoms, with no mention of future intentions. It describes a concrete action that happened, qualifying as a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete past action of overdosing, which fits the definition of 'Attempt' as it involves a historic suicidal action (e.g., overdose). There are no future plans mentioned, so it's not 'Behavior.' It's not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond thoughts to actual behavior, and not 'Indicator' due to explicit references to self-harm and death.

At peace knowing it's soon. Hope my plan works though, there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""destined to do it,"" chronic stress, hellish trauma affecting health, signs of severe chronic fatigue syndrome leading to disability, and a decision to proceed with something implied to be ending life. Emotional indicators include feelings of calmness and peace about an impending event, along with hopelessness about living in a failing body. There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm, but the context implies it. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed, and no references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""destined to do it,"" ""I've made my decision,"" ""at peace knowing it's soon,"" and ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up,"" which express a desire to end life.
   - Since it's not entirely explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the expressions qualify as suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, only a vague reference to ""my plan"" and ""Hope my plan works though"" without detailing tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly; it's implied but not described.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' so this does not qualify as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""it's soon,"" ""I've made my decision""), not past events.
   - No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, fitting 'ideation,' as there is no specific plan mentioned. It goes beyond general distress but lacks the explicit planning required for 'behavior.' Given the rules, when in doubt about explicitness, I considered 'indicator,' but the clear desire to end life tips toward 'ideation.'

I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, unemployment, and a desire to find a ""suicide forum."" There are mentions of emotional indicators like ongoing hopelessness and despair, but no references to death, dying, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations. No past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly references a ""suicide forum."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly, but the mention of seeking a suicide forum implies suicidal thoughts. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or preparation, so this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past and current feelings (e.g., feeling hopeless for months), but it does not describe past attempts or explicit future intentions for suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes an explicit mention of suicide through the reference to a suicide forum, indicating suicidal thoughts or feelings without any specific plan or preparation. This aligns with 'ideation,' as there is no evidence of planning or past attempts.

Idc if no one responds I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die even though I know it's painful idc just want an end",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions self-harm and death with phrases like ""slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""That's how low my expectations have of getting away from my parents,"" ""I just wanted my mother to tell me it'll be okay,"" and ""Idc just want an end."" There is a specific method mentioned: slashing wrists. No references to past suicide attempts are clearly evident; the phrase ""I tried, I guess"" seems to refer to considering sex work, not suicide.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""want an end"" and the intent to die via slashing wrists.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slash my wrists"" indicates a specific method (using a sharp object).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, such as acquiring tools or writing a note.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior,' but as per rules, if unsure, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; however, the method is clear here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists""), not past events. The ""I tried, I guess"" part appears to be about non-suicidal actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""slash my wrists""), which fits the 'behavior' category as it includes a plan (specific method) without describing a past attempt. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the method detail.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as ""my life is not able to be fixed,"" ""no-one I know has gone through the things I have,"" and ""life will get better is the most bullshit phase."" There are mentions of death and dying with phrases like ""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone"" and ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it."" Emotional indicators show deep dissatisfaction and a desire for the pain to end. There are no specific plans, methods, or references to past attempts mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I cannot wait to die,"" which directly expresses a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I cannot wait to die"" and the implication of preparing for death via funeral costs.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a mention of ""fixing all of the funeral costs,"" which could suggest preparation for one's own death, but it is not explicit or detailed enough to confirm as a concrete plan (e.g., no mention of a suicide note or acquiring means). Given the uncertainty, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I cannot wait to die"" and handling funeral costs), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die), but lacks a specific plan or method, making it fit 'ideation.' It goes beyond general distress but does not meet the criteria for 'behavior' due to the absence of explicit preparations like methods or tools. If unsure about the plan, 'ideation' is the safer choice.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life, such as questioning the point of life if it won't improve, describing past happiness now lost, and anticipating a depressed future. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and a sense of inevitable depression, but no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there's a rhetorical question about the point of life, which implies general despair but not a clear desire to end one's life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plan or method, so this doesn't qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to past events (lost happiness) and current/future feelings (destined for depression), but it does not describe past attempts or indicate future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There are no elements of 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt' present.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to jumping from a bridge in NYC to achieve the highest chance of death, which implies self-harm or suicide. There are emotional indicators of resignation and hopelessness, such as doubting anyone will respond and wishing for things to ""pan out."" Specific plans are mentioned, like selecting a bridge by the weekend. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the description of jumping from a bridge for a high chance of death. Since it's not explicitly worded as ""suicide,"" but the intent is clear, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the context strongly suggests suicidal intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as jumping from a bridge and evaluating which one offers the best chance of death. There are signs of preparation, like planning to pick a bridge by the weekend. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here the method and timeline make it explicit enough for 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions, as the user mentions picking a bridge by the weekend, indicating upcoming action rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die (via jumping from a bridge) and mentions a specific plan with a method (bridge selection) and preparation (timeline by the weekend). This aligns with 'Behavior,' as it goes beyond mere thoughts to include planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include feelings of being misunderstood by parents, frustration at age 23, a desire for someone to recognize their efforts, and a sense of being an ""alien"" destined to suffer in pain. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""I am here to live in pain"" and ""The pain will never loosen its grip."" However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though phrases like ""I will never die, I will never be free"" suggest ongoing suffering and a lack of freedom, it is not a direct desire to end one's life. Since it is unclear and leans toward vague distress, I am choosing to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and a perceived destiny of suffering, with no reference to past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and suicide explicitly through references to the user's sister's completed suicide and her past attempts. It also includes the user's own past ""aborted attempt at suicide"" about 6 years ago. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, doubt, pain, and a sense that ending life could be a ""welcome end."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for self-harm. The user expresses thoughts about not wanting to continue living but frames it as contemplation rather than action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the sister's suicide and the user's past attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" and ""the idea of that state lasting forever is hard to turn away from.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only general thoughts and considerations are described.
   - Since no explicit plan is present, this aligns with ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (sister's suicide and user's past attempt) but also current/future intentions (ongoing thoughts about ending life). The primary focus is on the user's present state of mind.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not be alive) without any specific plan or method, which fits 'Ideation.' It mentions a past attempt, but the content is not primarily about that attempt, and there are no current plans, so it doesn't qualify as 'Attempt.' There's no evidence of planning or behavior, ruling out 'Behavior.' It's not vague enough to be 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses deep disappointment and hopelessness about life achievements leading to nothing. It mentions emotional numbness, no hope, joy, or emotion. There is a clear implication of ending life with phrases like ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess"" and an apology to those who cared, suggesting it's for the best.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Suicide is not explicitly stated with the word ""suicide,"" but it's strongly implied through the planning to ""do it in the tub.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, numbness, and a sense of futility in efforts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, it specifies a plan (""I plan on doing it in the tub"") and mentions minimizing mess, which implies a method like drowning or self-harm in that location.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of intent to end life through planning.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the overall despair and the statement about planning to ""do it.""
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While not crystal clear, the context makes it evident, so I won't lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""in the tub"" indicates a location and implies a method to end life with less mess.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the mention of planning and considering the location suggests preparation.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Here, planning is explicitly referenced, so it fits 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past efforts (e.g., graduating) but focuses on current feelings of hopelessness and future intentions (e.g., ""I plan on doing it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to end life) and a specific plan (method and location in the tub), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning preparations, so 'Behavior' is the best fit.

I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to end life (""wanting to end it"" and ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT""), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, loneliness, trauma, epilepsy, body dysmorphia, anorexia, and addiction to painkillers. There are references to past self-harm through overuse of painkillers and antidepressants, leading to health issues like liver damage, but no clear specific plans or methods for future actions. Emotional indicators include feelings of abandonment, failure, and overwhelming distress from childhood traumas and family neglect.
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: Yes, through phrases like ""wanting to end it"" and the title implying suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong presence of hopelessness, despair, and suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No explicit details on methods (e.g., no mention of acquiring tools or locations for suicide); only past use of painkillers is described, which relates to self-harm but not as a current plan.
   - References to past attempts: Indirectly, through descriptions of taking painkillers leading to addiction and health damage, but this is not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt; it's more about coping mechanisms.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""wanting to end it"" and the title).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., desire to ""end it"").
   - The mentions are clear, so this supports moving beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for a future act; only past use of painkillers is noted, which could imply self-harm but lacks details on current preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of active preparations like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since there's no clear explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers mostly to past events (childhood traumas, family issues, addiction) and current feelings of wanting to end it, but not as a future-oriented plan. No specific past suicide attempts are described, only past self-harm behaviors.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to end life), fitting 'ideation', as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned for a current or future action. It does not qualify as 'behavior' due to the lack of explicit planning, and it's not purely 'indicator' because of the direct suicide references. No concrete past attempts are detailed, so 'attempt' does not apply.

255,"I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts until my parents made me break up with my boyfriend. He was everything to me. I loved him so much. He was so perfect. My parents found out I have been talking to him online and told me they don't want me talking to him ever again. They also don't trust me anymore and keep on asking what I'm doing on my phone. I really want to fucking kill myself. Not only did I lose my boyfriend, I lost the respect of my parents and I lost my respect for them. I have no one. I was getting over my suicidal thoughts when I was with him, but now they're coming back. I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head. We both unfollowed each other on social media and deleted our conversations. He said he was crying. I felt like crying. I feel like cutting myself again. Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts, a desire to kill oneself, and a specific plan involving going to a train station to lay on the tracks and be hit by a train. Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, anger, and loss (e.g., breakup with boyfriend, loss of parental respect). There are references to past suicidal thoughts and past self-harm (e.g., ""I was getting over suicidal thoughts"" and ""I feel like cutting myself again""). No explicit preparations like acquiring tools or writing a note are mentioned, but the method (train tracks) is detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I really want to fucking kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., desire to kill oneself and thoughts of being crushed by a train).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., running to the train station, laying head on tracks, letting a train crush the head, which specifies a location and means).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs like notes or acquiring means, but the detailed description of a method qualifies as a plan.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with the need to classify as 'behavior' per the definitions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (previous suicidal thoughts and self-harm inclinations) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I'm thinking about running away""). The plan is presented as a current thought, not just past.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (train station and method), which fits the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond ideation by detailing a method, even without confirmed preparations. There are references to past thoughts but no description of a completed past attempt, so 'Attempt' doesn't apply primarily. Based on the rules, this is clearly 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

If I am forced to live then put me on a thorazine dri0 so I can be a zombie until the world lets me die.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include explicit mentions of wanting to die, past suicide attempts, not regretting them, a specific past attempt where the user was saved, jealousy towards someone who succeeded in suicide, a belief that they should be able to kill themselves, dissatisfaction with life and the system, ongoing depression despite medication, intrusive thoughts, and a desire to alter reality or be put on medication to endure life until death.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: Yes, with direct references to ""wanted to die,"" ""suicide attempts,"" and ""I should be able to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, jealousy, anger, and intrusive thoughts are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No current specific plans or methods are mentioned; references are to past attempts and vague desires (e.g., wanting to be put on Thorazine), but nothing like acquiring tools or locations for a current action.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, the post describes multiple past suicide attempts, including one where the user was saved.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I have wanted to die"" and ""I should be able to kill myself.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for current intentions; only past attempts are referenced without details on methods.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, for current or future actions.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There are no explicit current plans, so this does not elevate to 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past suicide attempts as concrete events and expresses current suicidal thoughts and desires, but no immediate future plans.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, including one that was ""successful"" but interrupted.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions. Although there are current expressions of suicidal thoughts (which could suggest 'Ideation'), the presence of detailed past attempts makes 'Attempt' the best fit, per the rule that posts referring to past attempts should be classified as such, especially without explicit current plans.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of trying to kill oneself, feelings of unreality in life, guilt towards family, pain from previous attempts, anger at survival instincts, shame for failing, and plans for future attempts. Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, isolation, and abandonment. There are references to past attempts (e.g., ""I feel shame for failing"") and indications of future plans (e.g., ""I'm going to try again with a different method""). Specific methods are implied (e.g., something involving ""math"" that might not be easy to back out of, possibly like an overdose).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""I'm going to try again""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., desire to end life and feelings associated with attempts).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, indirectly (e.g., ""a different method that's much easier and not so easy to back out of,"" and ""my math is off,"" suggesting calculation for a method like overdose). Are there signs of preparation? Yes, with references to timing (e.g., ""maybe tomorrow"") and having ""plenty of opportunities."" If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here it's clear enough to indicate planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to both past events (e.g., past attempts where the user failed) and current/future intentions (e.g., planning to try again soon). Past attempts are specifically described through feelings of shame and failure.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicide and past attempts, which aligns with 'Attempt.' Additionally, it includes current plans, and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt.' It goes beyond 'Ideation' due to the planning element and is not just 'Indicator' or 'Behavior' alone.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme distress, including feelings of hopelessness (""A day feels like a month,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""Nothing to do,"" ""Reminded every second of others successes,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""No money will rot your brain,"" ""It's over""). There is a mention of wanting to ""end it,"" which implies death or suicide. Emotional indicators include despair and hatred, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life, which is a clear indicator of suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as seen in the desire for courage to ""end it.""
   - The language is explicit enough in context, so it goes beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since no plan is indicated, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to end it), fitting the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves a desire to not be alive without any specific plan. It is not 'Indicator' because of the explicit mention of ending life. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The user mentions a specific date and time (April 13, 2021, at 13:14 hours), references their birth at that time 18 years ago, expresses self-devaluation (""I'm not worth living""), and directly states intent to end their life (""I'm offing myself then"" and ""Goodbye world""). There are mentions of death and suicide through phrases like ""going out of this world"" and ""offing myself."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. No specific methods, tools, or preparations are detailed beyond the time. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""offing myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through statements like ""I'm not worth living"" and ""I'm offing myself then.""
   - The language is clear and explicit, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, substances, locations, or means (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, or jumping).
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post specifies a date and time, which could imply some level of planning, but it doesn't describe explicit preparations like writing a note or acquiring means. Since the definitions require a specific method or clear preparations for 'behavior,' and the instructions state to choose 'ideation' if unsure, this does not qualify as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a future intention (on April 13, 2021), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks a specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves desires to end one's life without detailing how. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a specific method or preparations (and per rules, choose 'Ideation' if unsure), and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which rules out 'indicator.'

There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there is an implied desire to end the pain, it is not directly stated. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. If there were any uncertainty, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there are no elements to suggest planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and possible future intentions (e.g., ""I have to make it stop""), but it does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and a vague sense of wanting to end distress, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, death, or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include feelings of isolation, self-hatred, hopelessness, and being a burden to others. The user mentions emotional struggles like anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder, as well as conflicts with family and friends. There are mentions of death and dying implied through phrases like ""I would have done it already"" and ""if I did it,"" which suggest suicide without explicitly stating it. Emotional indicators include despair, self-loathing, and a desire for non-existence. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but phrases like ""I would have done it already"" and ""if I did it"" strongly imply it.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements like ""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge,"" and ""nothing is better than this,"" indicating a desire to end one's life.
   - Since it's not entirely explicit but leans toward indication of suicidal thoughts, I am considering the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear; however, the context clearly expresses a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items is mentioned.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; here, there's no evidence of a plan, so it doesn't qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers primarily to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., being on the edge and the fear of attempting), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""I would have done it already""), which goes beyond general distress, making it more than 'indicator'. However, there are no specific plans or methods mentioned, so it doesn't qualify as 'behavior'. It best fits 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of self-hatred, depression, feelings of failure as a parent and individual, hopelessness, and a desire to end life in the future. There are mentions of not wanting to live, being comfortable with leaving life, and identifying as suicidal, but no specific methods, tools, or preparations are described. Emotional indicators include despair, lack of motivation, and a sense of being a waste of space. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states, ""I would say I'm suicidal.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" and implying a future intent after 11 years.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plans.

   - The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., waiting until the son is an adult), but there are no descriptions of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

Specifically, the user mentions ""struggling to hold on,"" ""been depressed and feeling like shit for years & years,"" and ""I just want off this life."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I just want off this life"" could imply a desire to end life, but it is vague and not explicit. Given the instructions to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, this does not qualify as explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or method, so even if there were ideation, it wouldn't escalate to behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""I'm struggling to hold on"" and ""been depressed for years""), rather than past events or future intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and a vague dissatisfaction with life, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

The post discusses minimizing harm to others, which implies intent but does not detail a plan. Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., the desire to end life and its consequences), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which fits 'ideation' as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide mention, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

Emotional indicators include hopelessness, exhaustion, and depression. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" indicate a desire to not be alive anymore.
   - Since there is a direct expression of wanting to die, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as it's not just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of ending life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is indicated.

267,I hope I don't make it. I don't want to survive another attempt because all my parents will tell me is how expensive the medical bill is. I just want to die without having to hear them again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include references to death and dying, such as ""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I don't want to survive another attempt,"" and ""I just want to die."" Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, particularly in the frustration with parents and the desire to avoid future interactions. There is a mention of a past attempt (""another attempt""), but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""another attempt"" and ""I just want to die,"" which directly express a desire to not be alive. Therefore, yes to both questions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are mentioned, and there are no signs of preparation. Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (""another attempt"") but primarily expresses current or future intentions, such as hoping not to survive and wanting to die. It does not describe the past attempt in detail but uses it to contextualize current feelings.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with Ideation. Although it references a past attempt, the focus is on current desires rather than detailing the past or outlining a new plan. Based on the rules, since there are no current plans mentioned, it does not qualify as Attempt or Behavior.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of intense suicidal thoughts, feelings of hopelessness and despair, waking up with suicidal thoughts, social anxiety, and the idea that death is the only escape from life's suffering. There are mentions of death and suicidal thoughts, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described. No references to past attempts are present.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no plans or methods are indicated, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and ongoing experiences, such as waking up with suicidal thoughts and the thoughts intensifying over time. There are no references to past events or attempts.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include reflections on what constitutes a suicide attempt, descriptions of past ""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" and two specific events. The first event involved testing a method by going until shortly before the point of no return and stopping. The second involved intending to die but stopping due to fear. There are mentions of death, dying, and suicide attempts, emotional indicators like struggle with thoughts and regret, and references to past actions, but no current plans or methods specified in detail.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post discusses suicide attempts and intentions to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the second event, the user states they went in with the intention of dying.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, there is mention of ""testing my method"" and going to the point of no return, though the exact method is not detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user describes actions taken to test the method, which implies some level of preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the descriptions go beyond thoughts to actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to past events, as the user describes two incidents that happened ""in the past year or two"" and ""long enough ago"" that they feel separated from them. There are no indications of current or future intentions, only reflection on past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past concrete actions that align with suicide attempts (e.g., testing a method and intending to die but stopping). This fits the 'Attempt' category, as it focuses on historic actions where something beyond mere thoughts occurred. There are no current plans mentioned, so it's not 'Behavior.' It's not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond thoughts to describe actions, and it's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions of suicide-related events.

Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I really want to die"" and ""I'd rather die than submit to anyone.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as noted above.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it moves beyond 'indicator' to 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., childhood bullying and family abuse) but focuses on current feelings of despair and desires to die. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of depression ruining a good life, mentions of family, friends, a dog, hobbies, and negative events like COVID, being scammed, and bad teachers. There are explicit mentions of death and suicide, such as ""contemplating suicide,"" ""looking up how to do it,"" and desires to ""jump in front of a car or stab myself."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and frustration. Specific methods are referenced (jumping in front of a car, stabbing oneself), and there's an indication of preparation through ""looking up how to do it."" No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""contemplating suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as wishing for the courage to end it. This is clear and not vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including jumping in front of a car (implying a location and way) and stabbing oneself (implying a tool). There's also ""looking up how to do it,"" which suggests potential preparation. Since specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present, this aligns with planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., depression before COVID, being scammed), but the suicidal thoughts and methods discussed are current or future-oriented, not historical attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific methods (e.g., jumping or stabbing), which meet the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of methods, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include expressions of extreme hopelessness, despair, and a desire to escape life, such as ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" and a wish for a nuclear bomb to kill everyone. There are mentions of death and dying indirectly through the desire for mass annihilation and personal escape. Emotional indicators include anger, betrayal from an ex, loneliness, and general dissatisfaction with life. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" and ""I want to leave and never come back"" indicate a desire to not be alive. Although not highly explicit, these are direct enough to suggest suicidal thoughts, but I must lean toward 'indicator' if unclear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No personal methods are specified; the mention of a nuclear bomb is a hypothetical wish for a global event, not a personal plan or preparation for self-harm. There are no signs of acquiring means or preparing, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future wishes (e.g., wanting to leave now), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""I don't want to be here anymore""), which fits the Ideation category as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction, so it's not just Indicator. There's no evidence of a plan or past attempt, ruling out Behavior or Attempt.

   - Key elements in the post include mentions of death and dying (""It will all be done after I die,"" ""I want to die""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair due to pressure from skin color, and a specific method implied (""pull the trigger,"" which suggests using a gun). There are no references to self-harm beyond this or past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""I want to die"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""pull the trigger.""
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pull the trigger"" indicates a specific method (using a gun).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the mention of a method suggests intent.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions (""I want to die,"" ""I'm just going to pull the trigger""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I want to die"") and a specific plan (""pull the trigger""), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves a mentioned method without requiring full preparation details. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the specificity of the method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of past self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"" and ""my forearms with my wounds are visible""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness,"" and feelings of isolation from family and work), and a reference to death as an escape (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past suicide attempts beyond the self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with the phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free,"" which indicates a desire for death. Since this is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or any concrete plans, so this does not qualify for behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (""I hurt myself two months ago""), current emotional distress, and possibly future intentions through the desire for death, but it does not describe a concrete past suicide attempt or current plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire for death) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of Ideation. It is not Indicator because of the direct expression of wanting to die. It is not Behavior due to the absence of a plan. It is not Attempt because the past self-harm is not explicitly described as a suicide attempt, and the category requires a concrete past action like an overdose.

I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of loneliness, sadness, and explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts. There are references to suicide, such as ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I think about suicide every day,"" and ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, fear of hospitalization, and a desire for help. Specific plans are mentioned with ""detailed plans in my journal"" and ""long conversations with myself about suicide,"" which suggest preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""the more suicidal I get"" and ""I think about suicide every day.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user describes increasing suicidal feelings and serious consideration.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post refers to ""detailed plans in my journal,"" which implies specific methods or preparations are being documented, even if not explicitly detailed in the post itself.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, writing detailed plans in a journal can be considered a form of preparation.
   - Since the post mentions explicit planning, this leans toward 'behavior,' but as per instructions, if uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; however, the description is clear enough to indicate planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing intentions, such as daily thoughts and weekly serious considerations, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and includes references to detailed plans, which aligns with 'behavior' as it involves explicit expressions of thoughts plus planning (e.g., writing plans). It does not fit 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, 'ideation' because of the planning element, or 'attempt' as there are no past actions described.

There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as the language suggests overwhelming distress. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post expresses general distress but does not directly state a desire to die. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post shows general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans.

No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""committing suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Not directly, but the statement expresses a thought about suicide, which leans toward suicidal ideation rather than just general distress.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This appears to refer to a current state (""I think I'm capable""), not past events or future intentions specifically. No past attempts are described.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""attempted suicide 11 times"" and ""I will use my suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the references to past attempts and future use of suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or detailed plans are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about acquiring means or writing notes.

280,"Welcome to the bottom of hell. Was in a bad break up 2 years ago that really messed me up. Fell into depression, stoped studying, flunked college. Managed to find a job, and then get fired 2 months after. Stalked my ex on Instagram for waaay to long which only made me feel more lonely, because she started traveling, made tons of new friends etc. While I found out I have no real friends anymore. The most fucked up thing is I still think about her every day. I've been in 2 short relationships since, but still, my mind won't let me forget her. Tried to kill myself 3 times by now. I've just given up completely. I just want the pain to end. I don't recognise myself any more",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post describes a past breakup, resulting depression, academic failure, job loss, stalking an ex, feelings of loneliness, ongoing thoughts about the ex, two short subsequent relationships, and explicit mentions of past suicide attempts. It also expresses current emotional distress, such as wanting the pain to end and feeling like giving up.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, it explicitly states ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, loneliness, and a desire for the pain to end.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods or preparations are mentioned; the references are to past actions.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, it directly states three past attempts at suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""Tried to kill myself 3 times.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements like ""I just want the pain to end"" and the overall tone of despair.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no details on methods for the past attempts or any current plans.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post focuses on past events rather than current preparations.
   - Since there are no indications of current planning, this does not elevate to 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to past events (e.g., breakup, attempts), with some current emotional expressions (e.g., wanting the pain to end), but no future intentions or plans are detailed.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, it mentions three past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (""Tried to kill myself 3 times""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. It does not mention current plans or preparations, so it does not fit 'Behavior'. While there are expressions of distress and a desire for the pain to end, these are secondary to the clear reference to past actions. The definitions prioritize past attempts for 'Attempt', and the rules confirm that posts referring to past attempts should be classified as such.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""accomplish death,"" ""End it now,"" references to shooting oneself, overdosing, and fears of failed suicide). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, loneliness, abandonment issues, physical pain, depression, and anxiety. Specific plans or methods are discussed, such as using a shotgun or handgun (e.g., shooting through the upper palate and questioning calibers), and overdosing like Mark Linkous. There are no clear references to the user's past attempts, though it mentions the father's death indirectly.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""don't kill yourself,"" ""accomplish death,"" ""shooting myself,"" ""overdosing,"" ""End it now"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., expressing fear of how to die and urging to ""End it now"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., shotgun, handgun with details on shooting through the upper palate and caliber questions, overdosing).
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post discusses researching and considering methods, which implies contemplation, but no explicit actions like acquiring tools are mentioned. Since specific methods are detailed, this leans toward planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ongoing despair and active consideration of methods), rather than past events. No past attempts by the user are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions specific methods (e.g., ways to commit suicide like shooting or overdosing), which aligns with 'behavior' as it includes a plan. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing means, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration and a desire to escape, such as ""Can't do any of it!"" and ""Just don't want this anymore."" There is a mention of wanting to ""sleep and never ever wake up,"" which implies a desire for permanent non-existence, akin to death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive anymore. Although it's metaphorical, it qualifies as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts based on the definition.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of a plan or method, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future desires (e.g., ""wanna sleep and never wake up""), not past events. There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'ideation' without any specific plan. It is not 'indicator' because of the direct expression of wanting to die, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as it does not describe past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The user expresses a desire to die (""I want to die but I'm scared""), feelings of exhaustion and hopelessness (""I'm so tired of everything. Tired of pretending, tired of lying, tired of being scared. Tired of everything. What's the point""), and a plea for help (""Can someone please help me work out what to do"").
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: There are direct mentions of wanting to die, which implies a desire related to death, but no explicit use of the word ""suicide"" or references to self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue with life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned; no tools, locations, or methods are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I want to die.""
   - Since ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive, this leans toward ideation, but I must consider the rule to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear. However, this expression is clear enough as a suicidal thought.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, substances, locations, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any steps toward acting on the thoughts.
   - Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; it should be 'ideation' if thoughts are present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I want to die but I'm scared""), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die, which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction (as in 'indicator') because of the direct desire to not be alive. There are no plans or past attempts, so 'behavior' or 'attempt' do not apply.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out?

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, such as ""make me want to die"" and ""I do not want to exist anymore."" This qualifies as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No specific methods, plans, or signs of preparation are described. The user mentions ""fighting the urge to go wandering off,"" but this is vague and does not detail any concrete plan or means. Since there is no explicit planning, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers primarily to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., wanting to disappear now), rather than past events. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die and not exist), which go beyond general distress, so it is not 'indicator.'

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include a metaphorical description of feeling trapped and out of control in a car with no brakes, expressing constant anxiety, sadness, and a desire for it to stop. There are mentions of death and dying indirectly through the idea of crashing into another car to end the situation, as well as fear of not dying from it. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and anxiety about a ""pointless situation."" There is a reference to a specific method (crashing into another car) and coming close to doing it, but no explicit mentions of self-harm tools, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used; it's implied through the metaphor.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly, as the user expresses a desire to stop the anxiety by crashing, which suggests wanting to end their life, but it's not straightforward.
   - Since it's not very explicit, I would lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the context clearly indicates suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies ""crashing into another car"" as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There are indications of coming close to doing it, which implies intent and near-actions, but no explicit preparations like acquiring tools or writing a note.
   - If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here the specific method is clearly described, so it goes beyond just thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""I want the constant anxiety to stop"" and ""frequently come close to doing it""), rather than past events. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts with a specific method (crashing the car), which aligns with 'Behavior' as it includes explicit planning. It's not just vague distress ('Indicator'), nor is it purely thoughts without a plan ('Ideation'). There's no description of a past attempt, so 'Attempt' doesn't apply.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post questions whether thinking about death is a suicidal thought but does not directly state or affirm suicidal intent. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user explicitly states, ""I won't commit,"" indicating no desire to end their life actively. Since this is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post refers to death via an accident, which is not a self-inflicted method, and there are no tools, locations, substances, or preparations discussed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's no indication of any planning at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current thoughts about death as a hypothetical option, not future intentions or past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post expresses vague thoughts about death and dissatisfaction with life but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. This aligns with 'Indicator', as the definitions emphasize that general dissatisfaction or vague feelings about death without explicit suicide references should be classified as such. When in doubt about explicit mentions, 'Indicator' is preferred.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include direct mentions of killing oneself (""finally kill me""), emotional indicators of despair and reluctance (""I wish I didn't have to do this""), specific plans and preparations (""Tonight is the last chance,"" ""It's been a year since I planned this,"" ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything""). There are no references to past attempts, but there is a clear expression of intent to end one's life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill me."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it expresses a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not detailed (e.g., no explicit tools mentioned), but there are signs of preparation (""the stuff prepared and everything,"" and reference to planning for a year). Since preparation is indicated, this suggests more than just thoughts.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions (""Tonight is the last chance""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions of a plan/preparation, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the explicit planning elements, and it's not about a past attempt, so 'Attempt' doesn't apply.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating suicide. It expresses a desire for the body to ""break down slowly and this just ends,"" which relates to death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-hatred (""I hate my body,"" ""I see no reason to fuel it""), and despair about appearance. There is a specific plan mentioned: ""I've decided to stop eating all together and starve myself,"" which is a method of self-harm leading to death. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like hoping the body breaks down to end things.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, starvation by stopping eating is described as a deliberate method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post states ""I've decided,"" implying intent to act, though not detailed preparations like acquiring tools.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this aligns with 'behavior' criteria.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as in the decision to starve oneself, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (starvation), which fits 'Behavior' as it includes a method for suicide. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the outlined approach.

Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch. In my past I've had everything that made me who I am stripped away from my character time and time again. It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive. But for now, in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness I've come to befriend over the last few months, but I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of ongoing distress, emotional pain, past hardships, confusion, and loneliness. There are mentions of not always wishing to be gone, which vaguely hints at thoughts of not wanting to exist, but no direct references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of brokenness, but no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though the phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is somewhat vague and indirect. Since this is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any plans or methods, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events (e.g., hardships and experiences) and current feelings (e.g., loneliness), but there are no references to past suicide attempts or current/future intentions involving suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness, depression, loneliness, and a desire to escape life.

There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used directly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""wish I could restart on life,"" ""my death will cause pain,"" and ""wish I wasn't so broken"" indicate a desire to not continue living. Since this is explicit, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about acquiring means or writing notes. Since there is no explicit plan, this fits ideation over behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""suicidal""), which aligns with ideation. However, there is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not about past attempts, so attempt is not applicable.

Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair (""I have been so distant to everyone,"" ""I am not a good person,"" ""I just want to get it over with""). There are specific plans and methods (using a dremel to target the radial artery) and references to the action as just completed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through descriptions of self-harm and intent to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""my death will only benefit people,"" ""I just want to get it over with,"" and ""if you are seeing this then it's already too late"" indicate a desire to end life.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a very recent or current event (""I just slit my wrists,"" ""I typed this out before and will post it once I have done it""), indicating a concrete action that has just occurred. It also references past decision-making (""it took me years to decide this""), but the focus is on the immediate attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes a concrete action that has happened (slitting wrists and using a dremel), which fits the definition of an ""Attempt"" as it involves a past attempt at suicide. Although there are elements of planning, the emphasis on the action already taken aligns with ""Attempt"" rather than ""Behavior.""

I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I'm better off dead""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as there is no mention of preparations or behaviors that would elevate it to 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

It was extraordinarily painful, but what was hurting me is about to end. The light at the end of the tunnel is almost here. I came extraordinarily close to killing myself. As in, my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's decision to continue living despite past suicidal thoughts, references to setting a date for suicide, writing letters, and having a set plan that was days away from execution. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""killing myself,"" along with emotional indicators of past hopelessness and pain, but now shifting to hope. Specific preparations are noted (e.g., writing letters and having a set plan), but no explicit methods or tools are detailed. There are references to past intentions but no confirmed past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""set a date""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, in the past tense, as the user describes coming close to acting on these thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods (e.g., no tools or substances), but preparations are indicated (e.g., writing letters and having a set plan). This constitutes signs of preparation, which aligns with explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post primarily refers to past events (e.g., setting a date, writing letters, and being days away from a plan), not current or future intentions. There are no descriptions of actual past attempts, only preparations that were not carried out.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions preparations like writing letters and having a set plan, which fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It does not qualify as 'Attempt' since no actual action occurred, and it's not just 'Ideation' due to the presence of preparations. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best category.

And I'm angry that it would be considered selfish by so many",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of regret for not ""doing it"" years ago, wishing they weren't alive, wanting things to be over since around 2012, and anger about still being alive. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, regret, and anger. It implies suicide through phrases like ""done it,"" but doesn't explicitly mention suicide, death, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts—only to past thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" and ""wish that I had just done it.""
   - Since there are direct expressions of not wanting to be alive, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator, as the thoughts are explicitly stated even if suicide isn't named.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no plan is evident, this should be classified as ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past thoughts (e.g., since 2012) and ongoing regrets, but not to any concrete past actions or attempts. It's focused on historical and current suicidal thoughts rather than future intentions or executed behaviors.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wishing not to be alive), which fits the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan, so it's not behavior. It's not indicator because of the direct expressions of wanting to die. It's not attempt since no past concrete action is described.

I don't think anyone wants to deal with someone elses administrative stuff while they're dead. It sucks so much because there are times where i just get ready to die but then the administrative thought pops up.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, and killing oneself. Emotional indicators show depression, hopelessness, and internal conflict about administrative tasks. There are signs of preparation, such as having written a suicide note that specifies what to give to people. References to past actions include writing the note, and current thoughts involve getting ready to die but hesitating due to practical concerns.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the post states ""I'm depressed and suicidal,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""wanting to die."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are not detailed (e.g., no tools or substances mentioned), but there are clear signs of preparation, such as writing a suicide note and thinking about canceling things for family. This constitutes explicit planning, so it goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past actions (e.g., having written the note) and current/future intentions (e.g., thinking about killing oneself and getting ready to die). No past suicide attempts are described, only preparations.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die, which rules out 'Indicator'. It also mentions preparations like a suicide note, which qualifies as explicit planning, making it 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'. There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'.

There is a mention of suicide with the phrase ""I've never been more suicidal in my life."" Emotional indicators include regret, impatience, and extreme distress. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the word ""suicidal."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as ""suicidal"" implies thoughts of suicide. Since it is explicit, this leans toward 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no mention of plans or methods, this should be classified as 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a past event (trespassing yesterday) and current feelings (being more suicidal now). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""I've never been more suicidal""), indicating a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include comparisons of Australia to Auschwitz, describing it as a prison colony, and drawing parallels to Hitler's ideology of purifying the human race. It expresses views on societal control, turning men into women, and living under a fascist regime with no real freedom. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators suggest general hopelessness and dissatisfaction with society, but these are not directed at the user's personal state. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The content focuses on societal and historical critiques without any personal suicidal references. Since it's unclear and leans toward no explicit mention, I am considering 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any planning, so no need to consider 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to historical events (e.g., Hitler) and current societal issues, but not to any personal past events, attempts, or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general dissatisfaction with life and society, including themes of hopelessness, but there are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or self-harm. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as per the definition that emphasizes lack of explicit suicide references.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of severe emotional distress, such as bad memories, thoughts, feeling unheard, family conflicts (dad yelling and seeming tired of the user, mom being occupied and uncaring), and a strong sense of hopelessness described as being stuck in a nightmare. There are mentions of death and suicide: ""Life is worse than death"" implies a comparison to dying, and ""i'm considering suicide"" explicitly references suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and frustration. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""i'm considering suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through ""Life is worse than death"" and the overall context of not being able to ""take it anymore."" This is clear and not vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is indicated, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., considering suicide and feeling life is worse than death), which go beyond general distress and fit the definition of 'ideation.' There is no specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as 'behavior.' It is not about past attempts, so 'attempt' does not apply. Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit.

I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's concern for their friend who has experienced suicide attempts, abuse, mental health issues (e.g., insomnia, lucid dreams of hanging, borderline personality disorder, bipolar, abandonment issues, eating disorders), and the user's own emotional state. There are mentions of death and suicide related to the friend (e.g., multiple suicide attempts, dreams of hanging), as well as emotional indicators like fear, confusion, and the user's own suicidality. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned for the user. References to past attempts are present but pertain to the friend.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states, ""I'm suicidal myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the user's self-description. Since the analysis focuses on the person writing the post, this applies to the user.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no mentions of tools, locations, substances, or preparations for the user.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the user's explicit consideration of ending their own life based on utilitarian reasoning, mentions of anger issues affecting relationships, self-directed anger, emotional pain, and a desire to check if suicide is the right decision. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself""), indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., dwindling relationships and future emotional pain), but no specific plans, methods, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself""). Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the user expresses that their existence causes more harm and questions the decision. This is clear and not vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is detailed, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., potential future pain), not past events or attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of extreme tiredness, hopelessness, and despair, such as ""I'm so tired,"" ""I won't ever be happy,"" ""Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure."" There are mentions of wanting to end life, like ""I don't want it anymore"" and ""end it all if we don't want to be here."" A specific method is referenced: a gun, which the user says would ""solve everything"" but is unavailable due to being in the UK. There are no mentions of self-harm, past attempts, or actual preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end it all,"" which implies suicide, and the reference to a gun as a way to ""solve everything."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, with statements like ""I don't want it anymore"" indicating a desire not to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as a gun, as a potential means to end life. However, there are no signs of preparation, like acquiring the gun or making concrete plans. Since it's hypothetical and not tied to actual steps, I'm uncertain if this constitutes an explicit plan, so I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing feelings of distress and future intentions (e.g., wishing for a way to end it), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, fitting the criteria for 'ideation.' While a method (gun) is mentioned, it's not accompanied by explicit planning or preparations, and given the uncertainty, 'ideation' is the appropriate category over 'behavior.'

I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed. Thanks for making it this far if you read the whole thing.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions suicide multiple times, such as ""suicide is viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act,"" ""suicide is seen as a solution,"" and ""wanting to end my life."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, including feelings of not wanting to live, lack of support, and viewing suicide as an escape. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used directly, and there are expressions like ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"" and ""wanting to end my life.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a desire to die prematurely and sees suicide as a personal solution.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated. Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ending one's life), but there are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, which fits 'Ideation' as there is no specific plan or method mentioned. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of any plan or preparations. It is not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

318,"""your not cutting your faking it!"" stares at my arm motherfuckerly. Im tired of all the people who miraculously believe that im either cutting for attention or faking it. I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions self-harm (cutting), scars, and a past incident where the user cut themselves. Emotional indicators include feelings of numbness, emptiness, pain, tiredness, and wondering if life is worth it. There are no mentions of death or dying directly, but self-harm is described. Specific plans or methods are not present; it's focused on past events. References to past attempts: Yes, the user describes a past self-harm incident a few months ago.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) - The post does not use words like ""suicide"" or directly express a desire to die, though it includes vague statements like ""wonder if it's even worth it anymore."" 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? (No) - The language is more about self-harm and emotional distress.
   - Since it's unclear and not explicit, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) - No current or future methods, plans, or preparations are described; only past self-harm is referenced.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) - Nothing indicates current preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there's no indication of planning at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? (Primarily past) - The post details a past self-harm incident and reactions to it, with a vague current emotional statement, but no future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? (Yes) - The user describes a concrete past action of cutting to relieve pain.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post describes a past concrete action of self-harm, which qualifies as a past attempt under the definition (e.g., a physical act like cutting). Although it's not explicitly labeled as a suicide attempt, the context of the post aligns with ""Attempt"" since a concrete action occurred in the past. There are no current plans, so it's not 'Behavior'. The vague emotional statement doesn't make it 'Ideation' explicitly, and it's not just general distress, so not 'Indicator'.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal ideation"" explicitly, as well as thoughts of acting on those ideas. Emotional indicators include severe depression, a depressive spell, bipolar 1 symptoms, spiraling worse, hopelessness, and concerns about hallucinations and delusions. There are no mentions of death, dying, or self-harm methods. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts. The focus is on current emotional distress and barriers to seeking help.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with terms like ""suicidal ideation"" and ""act on my suicidal thoughts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through references to suicidal thoughts, though not phrased as a direct desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as no mention of acquiring means or writing a note.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this fits 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., considering the hospital), not past events.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead""), mentions of substance use (""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily""), emotional distress (anger towards family, hopelessness about being forced into an institution), and a past negative experience with antipsychotics. There are mentions of death and dying, emotional indicators like despair and resentment, and potential self-harm through heroin use. No explicit references to past suicide attempts, but heroin could imply a method for harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead,"" which directly express a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as noted above.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post mentions starting heroin daily, which is a substance that could be used for self-harm or overdose, indicating a potential method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, regular heroin use could be seen as preparation for ending life, as it involves acquiring and using a means (substances) that aligns with suicide methods.
   - Since specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present (heroin as a means), this leans toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Within 4 weeks,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead""), with a brief mention of a past experience (antipsychotics), but the focus is on ongoing and upcoming actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I hope I die soon"") and mentions a specific method (heroin use), which qualifies as explicit planning. Therefore, it fits 'behavior' as it includes both suicidal desires and a mentioned plan/method, per the definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses the ""position of the gun"" for ""hitting the brain stem,"" which implies a method for self-harm or suicide. It also expresses dismissal of reasons to live, such as family, regrets, or motivations to continue living, indicating hopelessness and emotional distress.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No direct mention of suicide, but the reference to gun position for the brain stem strongly implies intent for self-harm or suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses complete indifference to life-affirming factors, suggesting deep hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Specific method mentioned (gun and targeting the brain stem).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, but the dismissal of life reasons implies a desire not to live.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While not fully explicit, the context leans toward planning.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a gun and the position for hitting the brain stem.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The inquiry about the best position suggests research or planning.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Here, specific methods are mentioned, so it qualifies as planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current or future intentions, as it's an inquiry about a method.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes expressions of hopelessness and specifically mentions a method (gun to brain stem), which aligns with 'Behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a means, so 'Behavior' fits best.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts (""thought about killing myself""), ongoing distress (""it wont leave my head,"" ""everything just keeps getting worse""), and references to self-harm (""my mum saw my self harm scars""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. There is a reference to past self-harm scars, which suggests past behavior but not necessarily a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""thought about killing myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it describes persistent thoughts of killing oneself. This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current and ongoing thoughts (""hasn't been a single day,"" ""it wont leave my head""), indicating present intentions rather than past events. The mention of self-harm scars points to past behavior, but it does not describe a full suicide attempt, so it doesn't qualify as 'attempt' on its own.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill oneself) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'ideation.' There is no evidence of current planning, so it doesn't fit 'behavior.' While past self-harm is mentioned, it doesn't constitute a described suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not appropriate. Overall, 'ideation' is the best fit.

My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide attempts, such as planning to ""attempt again"" in a few hours, references to past overdoses (three times since leaving the hospital), and a first attempt earlier in the year. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm just so tired,"" ""I give up""), self-hatred (""I hate every little thing about myself""), and despair (""My mind has won. Goodbye.""). There are expressions of wanting to die and not loving oneself, along with reflections on family and mental health.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""want to die,"" ""attempt again,"" ""overdose three times,"" ""first attempt"").
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, self-loathing.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, a plan is indicated with ""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again,"" and past methods include overdoses. No explicit new preparations are detailed, but the context implies intent.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, multiple references (e.g., three overdoses and a first attempt).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""attempt again,"" ""want to die"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I don't want to live in this body anymore"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, past methods like overdoses are referenced, and the current plan implies a similar action.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly detailed, but the statement ""I'm going to attempt again"" suggests an imminent plan. Since this indicates a plan, it leans toward 'behavior' or 'attempt,' but we'll evaluate further.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Here, it's not uncertain as a plan is expressed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Yes, it refers to past attempts (e.g., overdoses and first attempt) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""going to attempt again in a few hours"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, including details like overdoses and the first attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes past suicide attempts and also mentions current plans to attempt again.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of emotional distress, such as hopelessness and despair related to personal life events (e.g., family issues, loss of a friend, alcoholism). There are mentions of death in the context of others (e.g., friend's drowning, mother's health issues), but no direct mentions of the user's own death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include phrases like ""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore"" and ""I just want this pain to end,"" which suggest general dissatisfaction and hopelessness. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts by the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though ""I just want this pain to end"" could imply a desire for relief, it is vague and not explicit. Since it is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - The post refers primarily to past and current events (e.g., friend's death, family struggles, becoming an alcoholic), with the emotional expression seeming current. There are no references to past suicide attempts by the user or future intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post shows general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans.

I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age?

   - This refers to both past events (e.g., past suicide attempts: ""I tried but it didn't work"") and current/future intentions (e.g., ""I won't fail this time,"" plans for after this weekend).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, specific plans (methods and preparations), and references to past attempts.
   - According to the definitions, it fits ""Attempt"" because it describes past attempts and also mentions current plans. The rule specifies that if a post refers to past attempts but also includes current plans, it should be labeled as ""Attempt.""

But I'm really grateful to be able to meet you all, if by any chance there is another life, i wish we could hang out again. But this life for me isn't it. Ill update back on this post innnn 8 yrs or so. Maybe? Who knows. No promises &gt;:) anyway, I hope you all have a great day and thank you for reading to whatever this is",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes direct mentions of killing oneself, specifically at ages 25 or 30. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""It's not worth it,"" ""I don't know what's wrong with me""), gratitude for others, and a sense of farewell (""Adios I can't,"" ""I'm sorry to the people I know""). There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I'm planning on killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""Adios I can't. It's not worth it"" and references to ending life.
   
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, substances, locations, or means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only a vague timeline (ages 25 or 30) and a mention of potentially updating the post later, but no concrete actions like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since no explicit plan with methods is described, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.
   
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to future intentions (e.g., ""at 30 or 25"" and the possibility of rethinking), not past events. No past attempts are described.
   
5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of killing oneself. It is not 'Behavior' because no methods or preparations are detailed, and the rules instruct to choose 'Ideation' if unsure. It is not 'Attempt' as there are no references to past actions.

329,"Been teetering on the edge lately. Because as a queer person I'm perceived as male and a threat. Now I know why the suicide rate for men is four times as high as for women, and I have so much respect for cismen who have to deal with being eyed with suspicion.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include the phrase ""teetering on the edge lately,"" which suggests emotional instability or distress, possibly related to mental health. It mentions being perceived as a threat due to being a queer person seen as male, and references the higher suicide rate for men compared to women. There are emotional indicators of distress and societal pressure, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm directly from the poster. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post references general suicide statistics for men but does not explicitly state the poster's own suicidal thoughts or desires. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, ""teetering on the edge"" is vague and metaphorical, not a direct indication. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no indication of any plan or method, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a current state (""lately""), but it does not describe past events, attempts, or future intentions explicitly.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and acknowledges suicide statistics, but there is no explicit mention of the poster's suicidal thoughts, desires, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit expressions concerning suicide, and when in doubt, I choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of ""suicide"" from the user's mom, a statement implying the user might be ""gone within 24 hours,"" a farewell message (""Peace out all""), and emotional indicators of distress and sadness (e.g., wishing others well while ending with "":(""). There are mentions of suicide and implied thoughts of death, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user references their mom's statement about suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" implies a desire for the user to end their life. Since this is clear, it goes beyond just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no explicit plan is detailed, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (e.g., ""within 24 hours""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., implying the user might die soon), which fits the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not an indicator due to the explicit mention of suicide and desire to not be alive, and it is not an attempt as no past actions are referenced.

331,"Abused as a child. I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I don't have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post describes childhood abuse by parents, ongoing emotional manipulation, dismissal by authorities, self-hate, and current inability to escape the situation. Emotional indicators include feelings of hopelessness, regret, and being trapped, as seen in phrases like ""I hate myself"" and ""it's killing me."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""it's killing me"" suggests emotional distress but is metaphorical and not a direct expression of suicidal intent. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no indications of any planning or means for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (childhood abuse and interactions with authorities) and current feelings of being trapped, but there are no references to future intentions or past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and emotional pain but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses a history of self-harm (four months without it until recently), current self-harming behavior (""I'm bloodying myself up now""), emotional distress (regret over breaking promises, hopelessness), and explicit references to suicide (""before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time""). It mentions death and dying through phrases indicating intent to end life, with emotional indicators of despair and failure. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations detailed (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances mentioned), but it references past self-harm as a trigger.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., the intent to ""kill myself"" and end it immediately).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No (no tools, locations, or substances are specified).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, but the post describes current self-harming behavior (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") and implies immediate action (""I should do it now""). Since this involves exhibiting self-harming behavior alongside suicidal thoughts, it aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'. However, as per rules, if unsure about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'—but the presence of ongoing self-harm tips it toward 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (four months without self-harm), current behavior (ongoing self-harm), and future intentions (implied immediate suicide). No past suicide attempts are specifically described, only past self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and exhibits self-harming behavior, which fits the 'Behavior' category as it requires both suicidal expressions and either a plan or self-harming actions. It does not qualify as 'Attempt' since no past suicide attempt is detailed, only past self-harm. It's not 'Ideation' because of the active self-harm, and not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""someone blow my head off,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" and ""please kill me,"" which directly reference death and a desire to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""im fucking done,"" frustration with people (""im tired of these stupidass ignorant people""), and self-loathing (""I always fucking wonder what people would think if they saw the real fucking me""). There is a mention of a specific method (""blow my head off""), but no clear signs of preparation or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""i fucking deserve death"" and ""please kill me.""
   - Since there are direct expressions of wanting to die, this leans toward ideation or behavior rather than indicator, as the desires are clear despite not using the exact term ""suicide.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my head off"" implies a method involving a gun or similar violent means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no mentions of acquiring tools, writing notes, or other preparations.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this suggests behavior, but it's not a self-initiated plan—it's a request for others to act. However, the presence of a method pushes it toward behavior over ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or immediate intentions, as seen in phrases like ""im fucking done"" and ""please kill me,"" indicating present desires rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of wanting to die, which rules out 'indicator.' It includes a specific method (""blow my head off""), which aligns with 'behavior' as it mentions a way to commit suicide. Although the plan is not self-executed, the definition of 'behavior' includes explicit planning like methods, so this fits best. It's not 'attempt' since no past action is described, and it's more than just ideation due to the method mention.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of hopelessness and anxiety about the future, such as graduating without a plan, fear of homelessness, inability to maintain a job, and dissatisfaction with life. There are mentions of death and dying, specifically ""cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now,"" which imply a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include despair about long-term sustainability of life choices and a sense of inevitability. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life right now,"" which directly express a desire to die. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post conveys a wish to end life to avoid future problems.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates actual steps taken toward suicide. Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions, such as anxiety about graduation and the desire to end life now to avoid problems. It does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, like wanting to end one's life, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of ""Ideation,"" as it involves desires to not be alive without detailing how to act on them. It is not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not ""Behavior"" due to the absence of a plan, and not ""Attempt"" since no past actions are described.

I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of profound failure in various life roles (son, brother, etc.), emotional distress such as hopelessness, self-hatred, isolation, and substance abuse. There are mentions of death and suicide, specifically ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" and a detailed description of taking muscle relaxers and pain killers yesterday with the hope of not waking up. Emotional indicators include despair, inability to seek help, and self-loathing. Specific plans or methods are referenced, such as the overdose attempt. References to past attempts are present, like the two failures and the recent pill incident.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""failed to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and hoping not to wake up. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I want to die"" and the hope of not waking up after taking pills.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details taking 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers, which is a specific method (overdose). Are there signs of preparation? Yes, as he acquired and consumed the substances. Since specific methods are described, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events, including two failures to end it all in the last 4 days and the specific incident yesterday with pills. It also touches on current feelings of despair, but the focus is on historic actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (e.g., the overdose yesterday and the two recent failures), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Although there are elements of ongoing suicidal thoughts, the presence of concrete past actions makes 'Attempt' the best fit. The rules specify that if a post refers to past attempts, even with current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., ""the times I have tried"" and past attempts where 911 was called) and current/future intentions (e.g., current desires to follow through with jumping in front of a train).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts and also mentions current plans, which aligns with the 'attempt' category definition. Specifically, the rule states that if a post refers to past attempts and current plans, it should be labeled as 'attempt.' Therefore, this fits 'attempt' rather than 'ideation' or 'behavior.'

The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there. I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life tbh",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and dying, such as ""I can kill myself on graduation night"" and ""stick some knives through my stomach."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, isolation, bullying, and family rejection. Specific plans or methods are referenced, like using knives as a method and tying it to a future event (graduation night). There are no explicit references to past suicide attempts, though past hardships like bullying are described.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I can kill myself on graduation night"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I don't have much to live for"" and the desire to end life with knives).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""stick some knives through my stomach"" as a method).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly detailed, but the mention of a specific method and timeline (graduation night) indicates planning.
   - Since a specific method is described, this aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., bullying, family issues) and current/future intentions (e.g., plan for graduation night). No past suicide attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress or vague thoughts, with explicit suicidal expressions and a specific plan (method of knives and a set time). This fits 'behavior' as it includes both suicidal thoughts and explicit planning, per the definitions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to recent actions (e.g., researching bridges and drafting notes over the past few days) and future intentions (e.g., committing suicide after the holiday). There are no descriptions of past attempts; it's focused on current preparations for a future action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and specific plans/preparations (e.g., methods and notes), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Ideation' because of the detailed plans, and not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it, but I need to have the option to end it all. So, with those obstacles out of the way, I'm free to get cracking. I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row, and once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision. Live or die. This is a weight off my chest. It could finally be my time. If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell. Goodbye for now!",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of relief in being free to end one's life, references to no longer having reasons to live (e.g., no friends worth staying alive for), and phrases like ""end it all,"" ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't,"" and ""live or die."" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and a sense of liberation from obstacles. There are signs of preparation with phrases like ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" and planning to decide later. No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) are mentioned, but preparation is implied. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end it all,"" ""commit lifen't"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods like tools or locations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, phrases like ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" and ""once I'm ready to end it"" suggest active preparation or steps toward planning, even if not fully detailed.
   - Since there are indications of preparation, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than just ideation, as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., feeling free now and planning to act), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress or vague thoughts, with explicit mentions of suicide and indications of preparation (e.g., ""getting my ducks in a row""). This fits 'behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal expressions plus some form of planning, even if methods aren't specified. It's not just ideation because of the preparation language, and it's not an attempt since no past action is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method.

All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, substances, or means are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing about notes, acquiring means, or any actions.
   - Since there is no indication of a plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only thoughts are mentioned, not actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire for peace through non-existence and direct mention of suicidal thoughts), but there is no specific plan or preparation.

I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time .

What's really worrying is I'm 26 now and each year has got worse yes there's lots of factors but there's levels of depression I didn't think we're possible. As you all well know,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"" and ""contemplate method over 100 times a day."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and worsening depression, such as ""no interest in modern life,"" ""each year has got worse,"" and ""levels of depression I didn't think we're possible."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied through the ongoing suicidal thoughts and contemplation.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, only general contemplation of methods is noted (""contemplate method over 100 times a day""), without detailing tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as no mention of acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since this is not explicit planning, it fits 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing thoughts (""constantly round and round""), not past events or future intentions with specifics.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts"") and desires related to not wanting to live, but lacks any specific plan or preparations. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves thoughts without detailing methods or behaviors. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no specific plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

353,"Please help, I'm at my rope's end. Basically,. I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me). I was loyal and did that. &amp;#x200B;. And suffered through all of this hell because of that decision",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include descriptions of severe emotional distress from sexual assault, family conflicts, feelings of being trapped, helplessness, and various traumas (e.g., surviving meningitis, financial burdens, and social issues at school). There are mentions of death and dying, specifically ""I just want to die,"" which indicates a desire to end one's life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, hatred, and feeling at ""rope's end"" (likely meaning at the end of one's rope). There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I just want to die."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as in ""I just want to die."" This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items. Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., assault, family issues) but the suicidal expressions like ""I just want to die"" seem to be current feelings. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), which fits the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is not indicator due to the explicit mention of wanting to die, and it is not attempt as no past suicide actions are described.

I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of self-doubt, feeling like a failure, and hopelessness about personal abilities and family perceptions. There are mentions of death and suicide through the phrase ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree,"" which implies a suicidal act. Emotional indicators include despair and confusion, as seen in statements like ""I don't know what to do"" and feelings of being a ""fuck up."" Specific plans or methods are referenced with the idea of driving into a tree at high speed. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of driving into a tree, which is a clear suicidal intent, and the mention of wanting to contact a suicide hotline.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, the act of driving into a tree expresses a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post specifies driving 100 mph into a tree as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is an indication of current context (""sitting in my car right now""), which suggests potential immediate action, though not full preparation like acquiring tools.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but here, the specific method makes it clear.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current intentions, as the post uses present tense (""I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of...""), indicating ongoing thoughts rather than past events.
   - No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post goes beyond general distress by explicitly mentioning suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (driving into a tree), which aligns with 'behavior.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide reference, not 'ideation' because a plan is described, and not 'attempt' as no past action is mentioned.

We started off a bit complicated, my mum is dying from cancer and at the start I told her that I cant commit to a relationship because I wasn't in the right headspace. That was fine at first but she wanted more and so did i. But I was weak and looked for comfort in an ex. I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened. Im so regretful and sorry for hurting her. My mum is in her final couple of weeks, im her primary carer and I dont know how to process any of it.

I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of regret and self-hatred over a past relationship issue, emotional distress from the user's mother's terminal cancer, fear of future responsibilities (caring for an autistic brother), and direct references to past suicide struggles and hospitalization. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't see any future ahead for me""), regret, and fear. There are mentions of death (mother's cancer and the user's own potential passing), but no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states, ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously,"" and implies future suicide with phrases like ""I will be joining her as well"" and ""the pain I will cause with my passing.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the implication of joining their mother after her death, indicating a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing is mentioned about acquiring means or making arrangements.
   - Since no explicit plan is detailed, this leans toward ideation, but the overall context must be considered with other factors.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events (previous suicide struggles and hospitalization) and current/future intentions (fear of joining their mother after she passes, suggesting a potential future action).
   - Past attempts are specifically described, and there are hints of current or future suicidal thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly mentions past suicide attempts (""I was hospitalised for it previously""). Additionally, it includes references to current or future intentions (""I will be joining her as well"" and ""the pain I will cause with my passing""), which, per the definitions, qualifies as mentioning current plans alongside past attempts. Therefore, according to the rule that posts referring to past attempts and current plans should be labeled as 'attempt', this fits the 'attempt' category best.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses severe emotional distress from a breakup, including feelings of hopelessness, mental exhaustion, and being ""tired of living."" There are mentions of vague thoughts like ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it,"" which could imply a desire to end suffering, but no direct references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include despair, weakness, and ongoing mental battles, with descriptions of dreams and memories exacerbating pain. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""I have to stop it"" suggest vague distress, it's not explicit. Since it's unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no details about tools, locations, or means, so this doesn't qualify as 'behavior'. If uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's not even at that level.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers mainly to past events (e.g., the breakup 6 months ago) and current feelings of distress, with a vague future implication in ""I don't have much time left,"" but no concrete future intentions or past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and vague dissatisfaction with life, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'indicator' as it involves emotional indicators without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die, as ""go sleep forever"" suggests a permanent end to life. Since this is a clear indicator of wanting to not be alive, it leans toward explicit rather than vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including the drugs and their quantities (Seroquel and Viepax), which could be used for self-harm via overdose. This indicates signs of preparation, as the user is detailing what they have. Given this, it goes beyond just thoughts and into planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions, as the user is expressing present desires and possessions, not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die and mentions specific methods and preparations (drugs and quantities), which fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it involves suicidal thoughts plus a plan.

Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-hatred (e.g., ""I hate myself so much""), fear (e.g., ""I am scared""), and a desire to end life. Specific plans or methods are referenced, such as a knife (past), a rope (current possession), and a building (possible location). References to past attempts are explicit.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through descriptions of past tries and current desires to end life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I want this to end,"" ""I have to do it,"" and references to methods indicate a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as a knife (past attempt) and a rope (current possession), along with a building as a potential location.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (e.g., multiple attempts with a knife) and current/future intentions (e.g., having a rope and wanting to proceed). Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans (e.g., rope and building), but according to the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'.

There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""I just want to end it"" suggests a desire to end one's life, which is a common indicator of suicidal thoughts. Since this is not entirely unclear but leans toward explicit suicidal feelings, I will consider it as an indicator of ideation based on the context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses a desire to end one's life (""I just want to end it""), which aligns with explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves a desire to not be alive without detailing a plan. It is not 'Indicator' because there is a direct expression of wanting to end it, making it more than just general dissatisfaction. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and it is not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses a hope not to wake up tomorrow, implying a desire to die. It mentions emotional indicators like tiredness of being alone, potential depression from missing Christmas, and hopelessness. There's a reference to attempting ""properly again,"" suggesting a past suicide attempt, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: There's an indirect mention of wanting to die (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"") and a clear reference to a past attempt (""attempt properly again"").
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, loneliness, and anticipated depression.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, implied by ""attempt properly again.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) - The word ""suicide"" isn't used, but there's a direct expression of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) - ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" indicates a desire to not be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It's not entirely unclear, as the desire to die is expressed, so this leans toward ideation, but the past attempt reference complicates it.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) - No tools, locations, or substances are specified.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (No) - Nothing indicates active preparation.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is detailed, it doesn't qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past attempt (""again"") and expresses future intentions (""that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, indirectly through ""attempt properly again.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to not wake up), but no specific plan, which aligns with 'ideation'. However, it also references a past attempt. According to the rules, if a post refers to past attempts and mentions current or future plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'. Here, the mention of ""attempt properly again"" in the context of future depression qualifies as referencing a past attempt with implied current/future intentions, so 'attempt' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include explicit requests for someone to kill the user, harvest their organs, chop them up, and hide their body to ensure they're never found. This directly mentions death and dying. Emotional indicators include a clear desire to end their life and avoid discovery by family, suggesting hopelessness. There are specific methods mentioned, such as killing, chopping up, and hiding the body, but no references to past attempts or preparations the user has already taken.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the user is asking to be killed. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user expresses a desire for death and to disappear permanently.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details methods like harvesting organs, killing, chopping up, and hiding the body. Are there signs of preparation? The post involves seeking others to carry out the act, which implies planning, though it's not clear if the user has personally prepared. Since specific methods are outlined, this leans toward 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current intentions, as the user is actively seeking someone to act now, rather than describing past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and details specific methods (e.g., killing and hiding the body), which meets the criteria for 'behavior'. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the mention of plans and methods.

365,"I'm fed up with it. It's now going on 10 years that I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts. Circumstances have changed, I've had great highs and rock bottom lows, but none of it matters. Every fucking day, something just snaps on in my head and then I'm fantasizing about my death. I fight to suppress them; some days are easier than others. Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here. I have no desire to die. But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death,"" and ""some days I consider it."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and exhaustion, such as being ""fed up"" with fighting these thoughts for 10 years, experiencing highs and lows that don't matter, and daily struggles. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts, only ongoing thoughts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through ""fantasizing about my death"" and ""some days I consider it,"" even though the user states ""I have no desire to die,"" the context indicates suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates active planning.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to ongoing and current thoughts over the past 10 years, not specific past events or attempts. It's focused on present struggles rather than historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and fantasies about death, which qualifies as explicit expressions of suicidal feelings without any specific plan or method. This fits the 'Ideation' category, as there is no indication of planning or past attempts. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

366,"My problems are getting worse, and I just really wish to end my life, but I just can't. Every day, I'm struggling more and more with my problems. I was emotionally neglected by my parents, and searching for the love and attention I never got is the only thing keeping my alive. Every thing I do is controlled by this. It usually starts by seeing someone getting praised for something, which leads to me thinking that I need to be able to do/ have these things to be loved. Every time I see things as simple as a drawing, just gets me more and more depressed. I can't go to a therapist or something like that, because my mom's mad at me for being even sad in the slightest. I can't talk a single word about mental health at all, without being scared that she will scream at me another time. I feel like I'm unimportant. Other people have problems much worse than mine. They deserve being cared for, unlike me. Hearing other people's problems just makes me feel sad, and envious, because these people are getting all this love that I never got, and I never will get. I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this. The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of severe emotional distress, such as wishing to end their life, struggles with problems, emotional neglect from parents, envy of others receiving love and praise, depression triggered by everyday things, inability to seek help due to fear of parental reaction, feelings of being unimportant and envious of others, and a stated inability to harm themselves.
   - Mentions of death, dying, or suicide: Yes, there are direct phrases like ""I just really wish to end my life"" and ""end all this,"" which indicate suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, envy, sadness, and feelings of worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, or locations) are mentioned. The user states they ""just can't harm myself even in the slightest,"" indicating no intent or ability to act on thoughts.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""wish to end my life"" and ""end all this,"" which directly express a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in the explicit wishes to end life.
   - The mentions are clear, so this goes beyond mere indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as writing a note or acquiring items; instead, the user emphasizes their inability to act.
   - Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior'; it aligns more with thoughts without action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to current feelings and ongoing struggles, with no mention of past events or attempts. It's focused on present intentions without progression to action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wishing to end life), which fits the definition of 'ideation.' There is no specific plan or method, so it does not reach 'behavior.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mentions, and it is not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

367,I lost control. I've lost control of my head I just want to cry I can't breathe I want to scream help please I don't want to live this again,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of distress such as ""I lost control,"" ""I've lost control of my head,"" ""I just want to cry,"" ""I can't breathe,"" ""I want to scream,"" and ""help please."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like feeling out of control and overwhelmed. The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" suggests a vague dissatisfaction with life experiences but does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, although ""I don't want to live this again"" implies a desire to avoid a situation, it is not a clear or direct expression of wanting to end one's life. Since this is unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no mention of tools, locations, or any preparations, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but it's not even at that level here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings of distress and possibly a past event (""I don't want to live this again""), but it does not describe past suicide attempts or indicate future intentions explicitly. It is focused on the present emotional state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post shows general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because there are no explicit suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship. I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it. And my mom didn't even tell my brother the whole truth. They can't keep hiding it and brushing it off. It's not helping!,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme distress, hopelessness, and a mention of ""my reason to die,"" which indicates suicidal thoughts. There are emotional indicators like despair over a ""sickness,"" frustration with family, and references to past trauma from an ex-partner. Specific preparations are noted with ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it,"" which suggests a suicide note. No direct mentions of methods, tools, or self-harm actions are present, but the note implies preparation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""my reason to die"" and the reference to leaving a note, which strongly implies suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as seen in ""my reason to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the mention of leaving a suicide note qualifies as a preparation for suicide.
   - Since preparation is indicated, this leans toward 'behavior,' but as per instructions, if unsure, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; however, the note is explicit enough.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past events (e.g., leaving the note and past traumas) and current feelings of distress, but the note suggests a recent or past preparation rather than a future plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""my reason to die"") and signs of preparation (suicide note), which aligns with 'behavior' as it requires explicit planning or preparations. It does not describe a completed past attempt, so 'attempt' is not the best fit. It's beyond 'indicator' due to explicit mentions and goes past 'ideation' because of the preparation element.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include the user's struggles with ADHD, feelings of abnormality, social isolation, bullying, family issues, job loss, loneliness, and explicit expressions of wanting to die. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I wanted to die,"" ""I just want to die,"" and a direct question about how to kill themselves without leaving a body. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and fear. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, though the user inquires vaguely about methods. No references to past suicide attempts are present; only past thoughts and expressions are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I wanted to die,"" ""I just want to die,"" and ""How do I kill myself...""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user clearly expresses a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, substances, or means are detailed; the user only asks a vague question about killing themselves without leaving a body, which does not constitute an explicit plan. 
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no indications of acquiring means or making preparations.
   - Since this is not explicit planning, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to past events (e.g., bullying, job loss) but focuses on current feelings and future intentions regarding wanting to die. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, only past expressions of suicidal thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without the elements required for 'Behavior.' There are no past attempts described, so 'Attempt' does not apply, and the explicit mentions rule out 'Indicator.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life, such as ""No point in it all,"" ""I hate being trapped in limbo,"" ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""I feel like I wasn't meant for this world,"" and ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void."" These suggest a desire to end life, with phrases like ""push me over the edge"" and ""eternal void"" implying death or suicide indirectly. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and a dim view of the future, but there are no mentions of self-harm, specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""I feel like I wasn't meant for this world,"" ""question what the point of moving on is,"" and ""one last push and I'll be free from it all and eternal void,"" which express a desire to not continue living. However, these are not highly explicit, so per the rules, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete plans.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates actions like writing a note or acquiring means.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, if uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here it's clearly absent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current feelings and vague future intentions (e.g., ""one last push""), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post shows general dissatisfaction and hopelessness, which could lean toward 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly mentioned. However, it includes expressions of a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""eternal void""), fitting 'ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. Given the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions, and since the expressions are implied rather than direct, 'indicator' is the safer category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of ""commit suicide,"" which directly references suicide. There are emotional indicators such as bottling up emotions, dealing with painful emotions alone, snapping, and breaking down, suggesting despair and hopelessness. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""commit suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as the post discusses people in general rather than the poster's own desires. Since the post does not explicitly express the poster's personal suicidal thoughts, and the rules emphasize focusing on the person writing the post, this leans toward not being ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or signs of preparation are mentioned. There is nothing indicating any plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a general process of how people reach the point of suicide, without specifying past events, current feelings, or future intentions for the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post mentions suicide explicitly but does not include any explicit expressions of the poster's own suicidal thoughts or desires, as required for Ideation. It lacks personal indicators of wanting to die, plans, or past attempts. Given the rules to choose 'Indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions of the poster's suicide risk, this fits best under Indicator.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own.

He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme fatigue with life (""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live""), hopelessness, anxiety, depression, and a sense of failure in personal and professional aspects like college, friendships, and daily routines. There are mentions of emotional distress such as frustration, dread, and inability to motivate oneself for basic tasks like showering or brushing teeth. Specifically, there is a direct reference to death: ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" No mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations are present. No references to past attempts are noted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I am so tired of having to live"" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"" indicate a desire to not be alive.
   - Since there are direct expressions, but it's not entirely unclear, this leans toward ideation; however, the instructions emphasize leaning toward 'indicator' if in doubt about explicitness. Here, the desire is evident enough to consider it explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of ending life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (e.g., wanting to be dead in the future) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction (which would be 'Indicator') due to the direct mention of being dead, but lacks the elements required for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a question about why people stop someone from killing themselves, possibly to end their pain. It mentions ""kill their self,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. There are emotional indicators like pain and a desire to end it, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are described. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""kill their self"" is used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post is phrased as a hypothetical question but includes ""Asking for a personal reason,"" which suggests it may relate to the user's own thoughts. Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this leans toward ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no details about plans or methods, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a general or hypothetical situation, possibly current intentions, but not past events or specific future plans. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions suicide through ""kill their self,"" indicating suicidal thoughts or feelings, but without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive without detailing a plan. When in doubt, we lean toward 'indicator,' but here the mention is clear, so 'Ideation' is appropriate.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I been suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., thoughts of drowning and planning to die by train).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., putting neck on train tracks).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, as they mention planning it for their 18th birthday, which indicates intent and a timeline, even if not detailed.
   - Since a specific method and plan are described, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (thoughts at age 10 or 11 of jumping into a lake, which did not result in action) and current/future intentions (daily thoughts and a plan for the 18th birthday). The past event was not a concrete attempt, as no action was taken.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and includes a specific plan (method and timeline), which fits the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not 'Ideation' because of the plan, and not 'Attempt' since no past concrete action occurred (the lake incident was only a thought).

I had a few rougher weeks lately and heard that someone who I know tried to end his life. Since then I keep thinking about it. It used to be something that wasn´t that ""real"" something I would think about, but it seemed more unattainable. It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try. I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of the user's past suicidal thoughts, current thoughts triggered by someone else's attempt, feelings that suicide now seems more attainable or ""ok to try,"" and a desire to stop thinking this way. There are references to suicidal thoughts and the idea of trying suicide, indicating emotional distress like normalization of suicide. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to the user's past attempts—only past thoughts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user directly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and implies a potential desire to try it. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""it’s now ok to try."" Since this is explicit, it goes beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates active steps. Since no plan is evident, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past suicidal thoughts (""through my life, but most are behind me"") and current intentions (""keep thinking about it,"" ""opens a window for me""). It does not describe any past attempts by the user, only thoughts and the influence of someone else's attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts"" and feeling it's ""ok to try""), but lacks any specific plan or preparation. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves desires related to suicide without detailing a method. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past action by the user is described.

There is a mention of wanting life to end, suggesting a desire for death. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there is a direct expression of wanting life to end (""just want my life to end""), which indicates a desire to not be alive. This leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. There are no signs of preparation, such as tools, locations, or substances. Since no plan is evident, this would not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and ongoing struggles, not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses a clear desire to end one's life, which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general dissatisfaction, so it's not 'indicator'. There's no mention of a plan, so it's not 'behavior', and no past attempts are described, so it's not 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include feelings of disassociation, dysphoria, emotional disconnection, and references to past events like ""nearly killing myself one night."" There are mentions of death and suicide through phrases like ""nearly killing myself"" and ""step off a building or over a bridge."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, disconnection from life, and a desire for control. Specific plans or methods are referenced with ""step off a building or over a bridge,"" suggesting jumping as a method. There is also a reference to a past attempt with ""nearly killing myself one night.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""nearly killing myself one night"" and the implication in ""step off a building or over a bridge.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post expresses a desire for control through potential self-harm actions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""step off a building or over a bridge"" indicates specific methods like jumping.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly detailed, such as acquiring tools, but the mention of methods qualifies as planning elements.
   - Since specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present, this leans toward 'behavior,' but we must consider the full context.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (""nearly killing myself one night"") and current/future intentions (""it'll only take one day where I step off a building...""). The past reference suggests a prior attempt, while the future-oriented statements indicate ongoing risk.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes a reference to a past attempt (""nearly killing myself""), which aligns with 'attempt.' Additionally, it mentions current plans (""step off a building or over a bridge""), and per the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt.'

The user mentions being ""scared it'll be painful,"" which implies consideration of suicide but does not specify how. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no explicit plan or method, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""i want to take myself out""), rather than past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method for carrying it out. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as it involves suicidal feelings without the elements required for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of severe emotional distress, such as feeling lazy, useless, a failure, and disappointment due to family pressure, grades, and quarantine's impact on mental health.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes expressions of extreme distress, hatred towards life, parents, a doctor, and daily experiences. There are mentions of ""thought about killing myself for 5 years,"" which directly references suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and ongoing anxiety. There's a vague reference to ""emails to send to my parents before I do it,"" which implies some form of preparation but doesn't specify what ""it"" is. No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), self-harm descriptions, or past attempts are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""thought about killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through ongoing thoughts of killing oneself and hating life.
   - The mentions are explicit enough to go beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There's a vague mention of ""emails to send before I do it,"" which could imply a suicide note-like preparation, but it's not explicit or detailed. Since the instructions advise choosing 'ideation' if unsure about explicit planning, I lean toward that.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to ongoing and past thoughts (e.g., ""thought about it for 5 years""), but not a concrete past attempt. It hints at future intentions with ""before I do it,"" but without specifics.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to kill oneself), fitting 'ideation,' but lacks a specific plan or method, so it doesn't qualify as 'behavior.' There's no description of a past attempt, ruling out 'attempt.' It's not just general distress, so not 'indicator.'

CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of severe depression, hopelessness due to personal circumstances (e.g., fear of losing a parent, job loss, and a bad experience), and a direct reference to ending one's life. There are mentions of death indirectly through ""Ending it soon,"" emotional indicators like depression and fear, and specific preparations involving a substance (14 grams of dextromethorphan ordered and planned to be taken). No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""Ending it soon"" implies a desire to end one's life. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the phrase and overall context of depression.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ordering 14 grams of dextromethorphan (a substance that could be used for overdose) and explicitly stating the intention to take it all upon arrival. This constitutes signs of preparation, as the user has acquired means for potential self-harm.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions, as the user discusses ongoing depression and a plan to act soon once the substance arrives. There are no references to past events.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses existential doubt about the value of life, questioning why people want to live and highlighting the user's age (21 years old with potentially 60 years left) and that they've only ""really lived"" 15 years, which wasn't good. It includes emotional indicators of hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post questions the desire to live in a general sense but does not explicitly state a personal desire to die. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. There is no mention of any plans, methods, or preparations, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings about future life prospects (e.g., 60 years left) but does not indicate any intentions to act. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post shows general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it involves vague dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses the risks of threatening to call the police on someone who is ""passive suicidal"" or ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal."" It mentions ""suicide by cop"" as a potential consequence and expresses concern about counterproductive behavior.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""suicide by cop.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, these are not expressed by the poster; they are discussed in relation to hypothetical others.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""suicide by cop"" implies a method, but this is not described as the poster's plan or preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, and even if there were, they are not attributed to the poster.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user specifies using an insulin pump and insulin pens as means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user has access to insulin and is considering getting a pump.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation.

I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of extreme stress about exams, mental health struggles, isolation from friends, academic failures, and hopelessness about the future. There are mentions of death and suicide, such as ""I'm finally considering suicide"" and ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit."" Emotional indicators include despair, confusion, and a sense of worthlessness. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I'm finally considering suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements like ""I don't want to do this anymore"" and questioning the point of life given that ""We all die right?""
   - The mentions are clear, so this moves beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is indicated.
   - Since no plan is evident, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings of distress and recent thoughts of suicide, with references to past events like quarantine and school struggles, but not to past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (e.g., considering suicide) without any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'ideation.' It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit mention, not 'behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, like ""I'm at a dead end,"" ""There's no point to it,"" and descriptions of family conflicts affecting mental health. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor references to past attempts, as the user states they've never attempted.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""wanting to"" suicide and ""feel like killing myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would"" and overall expressions of despair about life.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit, so this goes beyond vague indicators.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring means is described.

Kinda sad I never got to do anything. Not that I could've anyways.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of ending life, suicide, and self-harm. Phrases like ""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape,"" and ""slit my wrists with some scissors"" directly reference suicide and self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as ""What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail?"" and frustration with school and parents. Specific plans and methods are mentioned, including using scissors for self-harm and preparations like writing a suicide note. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes – phrases like ""I'm ending my life tonight"" and ""Killing myself is the only escape"" directly express suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes – statements such as ""I'll stop being a coward finally"" and ""So goodbye everyone"" indicate a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes – ""slit my wrists with some scissors"" specifies a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes – The post mentions having written a suicide note on the notes app and planning to delete everything before acting.
   - Since explicit planning is present, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions, such as acting ""tonight"" and when ""everyone is going to bed."" There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and includes specific plans and preparations, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, not just 'Ideation' because of the detailed plan, and not 'Attempt' as it describes future actions rather than past ones.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""my plan to kill myself,"" which directly references suicide. It also includes emotional indicators like frustration and anger (e.g., ""what the fuck"" and the analogy to preventing euthanasia), suggesting distress and hopelessness. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""plan to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the mention of the plan, though not stated as a standalone desire.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, only a general ""plan"" is referenced without details like tools, substances, or locations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post focuses on the plan being revealed, not on any actions taken.
   - Since there's no explicit detail on methods or preparations, and the rules instruct to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this leans toward 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a current or recent situation (the friend telling the family), implying a plan that was intended for the future, but no past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""plan to kill myself""), which fits 'ideation' as there are no specific plans or methods detailed. It does not qualify as 'behavior' due to the lack of explicit planning elements, and it's not 'attempt' since no past actions are mentioned. It's not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a direct mention of suicide (""im gonna kill myself""), a specified timeline (""3 weeks from now""), expressions of withdrawal from interactions (""minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks""), and concern for others (""I hope my baby ends up safe""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as the user expresses intent to isolate before ending their life. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, substances, locations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""im gonna kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as the user states their intention to kill themselves.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, substances, or locations. Are there signs of preparation? The post mentions withdrawing from interactions for 3 weeks, which could imply some form of preparation, and specifies a timeline. However, this does not constitute explicit planning like acquiring means or writing a note. Since the instructions advise to choose 'ideation' if uncertain about explicit planning, I will lean toward that.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to future intentions (""3 weeks from now""), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks specific methods or detailed preparations for the act. This aligns with 'Ideation' as defined, since there is no explicit plan involving means or methods, and the rules instruct to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a question about whether a specific combination of substances would kill the person, listing: 3 bottles of Midol, 30 20mg pills of Prozac, a bottle of Tylenol, and a water bottle full of alcohol. This implies consideration of lethality through overdose. There are no direct emotional indicators like hopelessness, but the query suggests potential self-harm intent. Specific methods (substances and quantities) are mentioned, but no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" is absent). There are no direct expressions of wanting to die, only an indirect question about whether the listed items would kill the person. Since it's unclear and not explicit, this leans toward 'indicator' per guidelines, but the context must be weighed against other factors.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including substances (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, alcohol) with quantities, which could be used for overdose. This indicates a potential plan, as it details means for self-harm. If uncertain, guidelines suggest choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior', but the listing of specific items qualifies as explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (inquiring about the effects), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post does not have explicit suicidal thoughts alone (which would be 'ideation'), but it combines an implied intent with specific methods and quantities, meeting the criteria for 'behavior' as it explicitly mentions a plan for potential self-harm. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""planning to end it,"" ""suicide,"" and specific ideas like staging a car accident to avoid it looking like suicide. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and concern for loved ones' mental health. There are no references to past attempts, but there is a clear indication of current planning and methods.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used directly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, phrases like ""planning to end it"" and ""I'll get what I want"" indicate a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, such as ""a car accident or something"" to make it not look like suicide. This constitutes a specific plan or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current and future intentions, as indicated by ""recently I've been thinking of doing it"" and ""planning to end it."" No past events or attempts are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of hopelessness, despair, and self-deprecation, such as ""complete lost cause,"" ""nothing I do can change it,"" ""constantly stuck,"" ""family are giving up on me,"" and ""always going to fail everything I want to do."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show significant distress and feelings of being a burden, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are present. The post refers to ""attempts"" but in context, these are attempts to fix life issues like job applications and booking driving lessons, not suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general dissatisfaction and hopelessness but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to end one's life. Given the instructions to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, this supports 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means related to suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but since there's no indication of planning at all, this doesn't apply.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post primarily refers to past and ongoing events, such as failed job applications and family interactions, rather than current or future intentions related to suicide. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts; the ""attempts"" mentioned are about efforts to improve life circumstances.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post shows general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, plans, or past attempts related to suicide. This fits the 'Indicator' category, as per the definition that emphasizes very large general dissatisfaction without explicit suicide references. When in doubt, 'Indicator' is preferred over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of feeling like shit, being depressed, sad, alone, and a need to vent or talk to someone. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as the user feels isolated and seeks connection. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general sadness and depression but does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to end life. Since it's unclear or not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, or any form of planning, so if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but in this case, it's clearly absent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and sadness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it involves vague feelings of depression without direct suicidal references. When in doubt, 'indicator' is preferred.

I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of severe emotional distress, such as hopelessness (""that light has disappeared""), worthlessness (""feel like a completely worthless person""), and despair (""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going""). There are mentions of death indirectly through phrases like ""Even my fear of non-existence after death doesn't seem to deter me anymore"" and ""it feels like I just can't continue."" Additionally, there's a reference to writing a note (""I wrote a note today""), which could imply preparation for suicide. The post also describes a recent event involving an ER visit and hospital transport, which may indicate a past self-harm or suicide attempt. Emotional indicators include anxiety, isolation, and frustration with treatment.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not continue living, such as ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going"" and ""it feels like I just can't continue."" Since it's not fully explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but the overall context suggests suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, or substances are detailed. However, ""I wrote a note today"" could be interpreted as a sign of preparation (e.g., a suicide note). If uncertain, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this needs to be weighed with other factors.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past events, such as the ER visit and hospital transport last night, which may describe a recent suicide attempt. It also discusses current and future intentions, like ongoing distress and the note, indicating present suicidal thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes a past event that likely qualifies as a suicide attempt (ER visit and hospital transport). Additionally, it includes elements of current distress and possible preparation (writing a note). According to the definitions, if a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be classified as 'attempt'. Therefore, this fits best under 'attempt'.

Specifically, it mentions ""Tried didn't work"" and ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work,"" which directly reference self-harm or suicide attempts. There are emotional indicators of failure and repetition, suggesting distress and hopelessness. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are clear references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""Tried to end my life again"" is a direct expression of attempting suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied through the attempts to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since no explicit plan is described, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to past events, as it describes attempts that ""didn't work"" and were tried ""again,"" indicating historical actions rather than current or future intentions. Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes past attempts at suicide, with phrases like ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work,"" which align with the definition of 'Attempt' as it focuses on concrete actions that have happened in the past. There is no mention of current plans, so it fits 'Attempt' rather than 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a description of a past accident (falling from a tire swing), ongoing physical symptoms (e.g., head fogginess, inflammation, hot water feeling), medical consultations, treatments tried (e.g., CBD oil, Cymbalta), and emotional frustration. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include feelings of hopelessness and not knowing what to do, stemming from chronic symptoms. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general hopelessness about health issues but does not mention suicide or a desire to end life. Since it's unclear and leans toward general distress, I am choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to any suicide-related plans or means, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to past events (the accident 7 months ago) and current symptoms, with no indication of future intentions related to suicide. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains expressions of distress and hopelessness about health but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it involves general dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over other categories.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes multiple mentions of death and dying, such as ""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" and ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-loathing, despair, and frustration, with expressions like ""I'm tired of well-intentioned strangers trying to help me get better"" and ""I'm just a fucking monster."" There are no specific plans, methods in preparation, or references to past attempts; the user explicitly states, ""I have no plans.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I deserve to die"" and violent imagery of death.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, with repeated statements of deserving death and not wanting to live.
   - The mentions are clear and explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, methods like ""bullet in my head"" and ""slit my fucking throat"" are referenced, which describe ways to end one's life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the user states, ""I have no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway.""
   - Although the user denies plans, the definition for 'Ideation' specifies that if specific ideas of methods are mentioned, it should be classified as 'behavior.' Therefore, based on the presence of these ideas, it leans toward 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions specific methods (e.g., bullet, slitting throat), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category as per the definition: it requires explicit expressions of thoughts plus mentions of methods, even briefly. Although the user claims no plans, the explicit mention of methods overrides this and fits 'Behavior' per the guidelines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying with phrases like ""I will die alone"" and ""the second they're gone, so am I."" It includes emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and emptiness, such as ""I'm only alive by obligation,"" ""I'm a hideous fucking mutant,"" ""I'm just a fucking sad man,"" and ""I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness."" There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I will die alone"" and ""the second they're gone, so am I"" suggest a desire to not continue living, but they are not very explicit about suicide itself.
   - Since it's unclear if suicide is explicitly mentioned, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the instructions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but since we're already leaning toward 'indicator' from the previous step, this doesn't apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (e.g., ""the second they're gone, so am I""), but it's not tied to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and a vague desire related to dying, but without explicit mentions of suicide or a plan. Per the definitions and rules, when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, it fits best as 'indicator' rather than 'ideation'. It's not 'behavior' due to no plan, and not 'attempt' as there's no past action described.

I don't know what I want anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of ""bad urges tonight,"" specifically ""suicidal ones"" and ""self-destructive ones."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, and guilt, such as thinking ""this might be our last conversation,"" crying after reading about the aftermath of suicide, and hating oneself for thoughts of killing oneself. References to ongoing urges since dropping out of college are present. There is a vague mention of having ""a plan but no date set,"" but no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are detailed. No references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal ones,"" ""thinking of killing myself,"" and ""I have a plan.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through thoughts like ""this might be our last conversation"" and the overall context of suicidal urges.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there is only a vague reference to ""I have a plan but no date set,"" without detailing any tools, substances, locations, or preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing a note is indicated.
   - Since the plan is not explicitly detailed, and instructions advise choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this leans toward ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing intentions, such as ""got bad urges tonight"" and ""they've been happening again for a while."" There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., urges and desires to die), but lacks specific details on a plan or methods, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions of suicide, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of specific planning details, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" in the context of questionnaires and therapy. Emotional indicators include feelings of stress, avoidance, hopelessness, and being trapped, as seen in phrases like ""it'll cause a massive issue,"" ""I find therapy tough enough,"" and ""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, nor are there references to past attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post directly references ""suicidal thoughts."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the acknowledgment of suicidal thoughts and the implication of lying about them to avoid discussion, which suggests a desire not to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any signs of preparation. Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing experiences, such as dealing with questionnaires and therapy now, and the increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts. It does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., mentioning ""suicidal thoughts"" and related distress), which fits the definition of Ideation. There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as Behavior. It is not about past attempts, so Attempt is not applicable. While there is emotional distress, the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts makes it more than just an Indicator.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include mentions of ""nearly killing myself/shooting up the school,"" which reference suicide and potential self-harm or violent actions. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as ""I hate how my ex-friend... bullied me,"" ""feeling like I'm just rotting away,"" ""I fucking hate living,"" and frustration with life's injustices. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned in the current context. References to past attempts are present with ""nearly killing myself,"" suggesting a past near-attempt but not a completed one.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""nearly killing myself,"" which implies suicidal thoughts or actions. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I fucking hate living"" and the overall tone of despair.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""Shooting up the school"" mentions a method, but it is referenced in the past context of being bullied into it, not as a current plan. There are no signs of preparation like acquiring tools or writing notes. Since no explicit current plan is detailed, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post refers to past events (""nearly killing myself/shooting up the school"") and current feelings of hopelessness, but not to future intentions or ongoing preparations. Past attempts are alluded to but not fully described as completed actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., hating living, nearly killing myself), indicating ideation without a specific current plan or method. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'behavior' due to lack of current planning, or 'attempt' since no completed past attempt is described.

Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include a description of a past overdose (OD) attempt, where the user swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and drank hard liquor. There are mentions of death and dying, as the user references wanting to die and surviving the attempt. Emotional indicators include feelings of stupidity, confusion, regret, and ongoing processing of the event. Specific methods are mentioned (ibuprofen pills and hard liquor), and there are references to preparations or actions like holding off going to the hospital. This post clearly references a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user describes attempting to kill themselves via OD and states ""I wanted to"" in the context of dying.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I wanted to"" and reflections on why their brain didn't recognize they could've died.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user details swallowing 120+ pills and drinking hard liquor as the method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, such as holding off going to the hospital, which indicates deliberate actions during the attempt.
   - Since this is about a past event, it doesn't involve current planning, so I won't classify it as 'behavior' for ongoing actions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This post primarily refers to past events, specifically the OD attempt, including the actions taken and the user's reflections on it. There are no clear indications of current or future intentions, though the user mentions still processing thoughts, which is more reflective than planning.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post describes a concrete past suicide attempt (e.g., the overdose), which fits the 'Attempt' category as it involves a historic action that occurred. It goes beyond mere thoughts or ideation and includes specific actions like ingesting pills and alcohol. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit, as the definitions prioritize past concrete actions over current plans or general expressions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include discussions of depression, the difficulty in continuing daily life, references to a video game (""Death Stranding"") with the phrase ""keep on keeping on,"" the isolation felt from friends not understanding, and the persistent, creeping nature of depression. It expresses hopelessness about a long-term cure.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: There are no direct mentions. The reference to ""Death Stranding"" appears to be about a game, not literal death.
   - Emotional indicators: There are signs of hopelessness and despair, such as ""it makes it hard to keep going,"" ""every day feels like the previous one,"" and questioning if a cure exists.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there's an implication of struggle in ""hard to keep going,"" it is not a direct expression. Given the instruction to lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, I will classify this as not explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction and hopelessness about life due to depression but does not explicitly mention suicide, wanting to die, or any plans. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit suicidal expressions, and when in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation.'

HI i'm a 15 year old girl and all my entire life i have been dreaming of becoming a high fashion model when i grow up but there's a problem only tall people can walk the ramp short people are not allowed. Ik that i can be a commercial model if i want to because there is no height requirements but i really2 want to be a high fashion one because that's what i've always wanted ,my whole entire life. If i don't choose the carreer that i want i know that i will never be happy with my life. I haven't grow since last year and to make it worse im only 4'11 feet and the height requirements for runway models are 5'7 to 5'8 or 9. I feel so hopeless with myself that's why i want to give up my life and just die. And that's not the only reason, all my friends are getting taller then me and i am losing my self esteem very fast. I REALLY WANT TO DIE but i can't leave my parents too,im their only child and if they lose me i don't even want to know what will happen to them. I FEEL TRAPED. THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR ME. IF I LIVE I KNOW I WLL NEVER BE HAPPY WITH MYSELF AND IF I DIE I KNOW MY PARENTS WOULD BE DEVASTATED. I hate myself, i really hate myself. i'm so hopeless and such an idiot, why did i want to choose such a career where i know there is no future for me.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions self-harm (cutting himself for a long time, resulting in scars), emotional numbness, a diagnosis of sociopath and self-mutilation, contemplating suicide, lack of joy in life, a suicide pact with another person, and references to the other person's failed suicide attempt (cutting wrists). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness, numbness, and despair. No specific methods for his own suicide are detailed beyond the pact, but self-harm is described as ongoing. References to past self-harm exist, and the pact implies future intentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""contemplating suicide,"" ""we agreed to do it together,"" ""I'm ending it"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I didn't want to live before,"" ""I'm ending it"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not for him directly, but the pact (""we will do it together"") implies a shared plan, which could involve methods like those mentioned for her (cutting). No explicit preparations like acquiring tools are described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The pact itself suggests some level of planning, but it's not detailed. Since this is uncertain, I should lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if not fully explicit.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (his self-cutting, her failed attempt) and current/future intentions (contemplating suicide, the pact, and ""I'm ending it""). The post focuses on his ongoing thoughts and the agreement for the future.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., contemplating suicide, wanting to end it), which rules out 'indicator'. It includes a pact, suggesting a plan, but the plan isn't detailed with methods or preparations, making it ambiguous. Per the rules, if unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There's no clear past suicide attempt by him, only self-harm, so 'attempt' doesn't fit best. Overall, the explicit thoughts without fully detailed planning align with 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include quotes from the user's parents that are abusive and dismissive, directly referencing suicide, self-harm, and past attempts. Mentions of death, dying, and suicide include phrases like ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair through the parents' invalidation of the user's depression and encouragement of suicide. There are references to past attempts (e.g., ""Did you try to kill yourself again?""), but no explicit descriptions of current plans or methods from the user themselves. The post focuses on the user's experiences and parental abuse.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through quotes like ""take a gun and kill yourself"" and references to past attempts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user does not directly express this; it's implied through the parents' words and references to the user's history. However, the post as a whole indicates suicidal context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, methods like ""gun,"" ""shoot yourself,"" and ""cut your wrists"" are mentioned in the quotes, but these are from the parents, not the user planning. There are no signs of preparation or current planning by the user.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to both past events (e.g., ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"") and potential future implications through mocking, but it primarily describes historical actions rather than current or future intentions from the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes past attempts at suicide (e.g., references to previous tries), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. It does not focus on current ideation without plans or explicit current behavior, so 'Ideation' or 'Behavior' is less fitting. Based on the definitions, this best matches 'Attempt' as it centers on historic actions by the user.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself,"" which directly refers to suicide and death. It expresses a desire for the least painful method, indicating emotional distress and hopelessness. There are no mentions of self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations in detail, nor references to past attempts.
   - Emotional indicators: The user shows desperation and rejection of positive advice (e.g., ""I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit""), suggesting hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is asking about methods (least painful way), but not specifying or describing any themselves. No signs of preparation are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill yourself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user is seeking ways to end their life.
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user is inquiring about methods but not detailing any specific ones (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances are named).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of preparation, such as acquiring means or writing a note.
   - Since no explicit plan is described and it's only an inquiry, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as the user is asking for information now, implying a potential future action. No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die and asking about ways), but lacks any specific plan or preparations. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailing a method or behavior. If there were specifics on how to proceed, it might lean toward 'Behavior,' but since it's not explicit, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""writing a suicidal note again"" and describes physical pain with ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside."" This includes a reference to a suicidal note, which implies suicide-related content. Emotional indicators include internal pain, suggesting distress or hopelessness. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or substances for suicide. The word ""again"" hints at past behavior but doesn't describe it in detail.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Suicide is referenced through ""suicidal note.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness is implied through the description of physical pain from emotional distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Writing a suicidal note could be seen as preparation, but no specific methods are detailed.
   - References to past attempts: ""Again"" suggests this has happened before, possibly indicating past suicidal actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, via ""suicidal note.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? No, but the context implies suicidal thoughts.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is explicit enough not to be unclear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, locations, or substances are specified.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Possibly, as writing a suicidal note is mentioned as an intention, which could be preparation.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since it's an intention (""I think I'm going to"") rather than confirmed action, it's not fully explicit.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to future intentions (""going to write"") and hints at past events (""again"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Not in detail; ""again"" implies something previous but doesn't elaborate.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit mentions of suicide through ""suicidal note,"" indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - There are no specific plans or methods described, only an intention to prepare (writing a note).
   - This fits 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts without a detailed plan. Although preparation is hinted, the uncertainty leads to choosing 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' per the rules.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""committing a massacre"" and ""slaying myself."" ""Slaying myself"" is a reference to self-harm or suicide, as it implies killing oneself. ""Committing a massacre"" involves harm to others, but we focus on the self-directed content per the rules. There are no explicit emotional indicators like hopelessness, but the language suggests distress. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""slaying myself"" is a direct expression implying suicide or self-harm, even if not using the exact word ""suicide."" 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""slaying myself"" indicates a desire to end one's own life.
   - This is not unclear, so it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no plan is evident, this fits ideation over behavior.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut).

There are mentions of death and dying (""I just want to die,"" ""gonna end my life""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""Too many problems, im a fucked up person""), and a vague reference to a timeframe (""this month""). No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I just want to die"" and ""gonna end my life."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes. This is clear and not unclear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, or substances. Are there signs of preparation? No, only a vague timeframe (""this month"") is provided, which does not constitute explicit planning. Since there are no specific ideas of how to commit suicide, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (""gonna end my life this month""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailed planning. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of specific methods or preparations, and not 'Attempt' since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of general dissatisfaction with the world, references to mental illnesses, and explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts."" There are emotional indicators such as suffering, hopelessness about the world, and being called pessimistic. No mentions of death, dying, self-harm, specific plans, methods, or preparations are present. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""suicidal thoughts."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as ""suicidal thoughts"" implies a desire to not be alive, though it's not currently expressed as an active intent. Since this is explicit, it leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there are no indications of plans or methods, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to ongoing or past experiences (""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughts helped me""), but not to current or future intentions. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" which aligns with expressions of suicidal feelings without any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of Ideation, as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts but lacks planning or behavior. It is not Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, not Behavior due to no plan, and not Attempt as no past actions are described.

I'm done being this sad fucked up person. If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out. It feels like only viable solution",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicide"" explicitly multiple times and phrases like ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and feelings of being ""done being this sad fucked up person,"" as well as considering checking into a hospital. There are references to planning: ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out"" and specifying a date (birthday). No specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) or self-harm are detailed, and no past attempts are mentioned.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""suicide seems like the only solution"" and ""If I kill myself"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, substances, or locations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post mentions ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out"" and specifies a date (birthday), which indicates intent to prepare.
   - Since there is mention of planning, this suggests more than just ideation, but as the rules state, if uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; however, the explicit reference to planning on a specific date qualifies as preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (e.g., planning for birthday), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions a plan (specific time and intention to plan), which aligns with 'Behavior' as it includes preparations. It goes beyond 'Ideation' due to the planning element and is not 'Indicator' because of explicit suicide mentions. It's not 'Attempt' since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of depression, feelings of failure, being a burden on family, and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I'm a failure,"" ""I don't deserve love or happiness,"" ""all I deserve is pain and loneliness""). There is a mention of ""thinking of ending it all,"" which suggests thoughts of suicide. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are described, and there are no references to past attempts or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""thinking of ending it all,"" which is a common expression for suicidal thoughts and indicates a desire to not be alive. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, implied in the same phrase and overall tone of hopelessness.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and ongoing struggles (e.g., ""This week was not the best,"" ""I've been thinking of ending it all,"" ""Now I'm just fighting this battle alone""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

I feel kind of sorry for my mom though, her dad died a few days ago and now my death will be following very soon too. I hope she learns to cope well",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of wanting to end something permanently (""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with""), a reference to an upcoming attempt (""I'll most likely attempt this weekend""), preparations for death (""get a will in place""), and mentions of death (""my death will be following very soon""). Emotional indicators include sorrow for the user's mom and concern for her coping, suggesting despair. There are no specific methods (e.g., tools or substances) mentioned, but preparations like a will are noted. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes) – While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, phrases like ""attempt this weekend"" and ""my death will be following very soon"" directly imply suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) – Statements such as ""I want to do this once and for all"" and ""get it over with"" express a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? (No) – No tools, locations, or substances are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? (Yes) – The user mentions getting a will in place and specifies a timeline (""this weekend""), which indicates preparation for suicide.
   - Since there is clear evidence of planning (timeline and preparations), this aligns with explicit planning rather than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""attempt this weekend,"" ""my death will be following very soon""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and mentions of a plan (preparing a will and setting a timeline), which fits the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by including preparations, so 'Behavior' is the best fit. If there were no plan, it might be 'Ideation,' but the preparations make it 'Behavior.'

But i really cannot live if i fail. The right time is gone, i have no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of conditional hopelessness (""I really cannot live if I fail""), references to past self-harm methods (blades for cutting), and mentions of potential suicide methods like meds or jumping from a place. Emotional indicators show a mix of despair (if the test is failed) and temporary positivity (almost happy, having purposes). There are no clear signs of current preparations, but past methods are noted. The post focuses on an upcoming test and internal conflict.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through references to not wanting to live if failing, and methods like blades, meds, or jumping. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, conditionally (""I really cannot live if I fail""), though it's not absolute. Since there are clear indicators of suicidal thoughts, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (blades for cutting, meds, places to jump), but these are referenced as past or unavailable now, without evidence of current planning or preparations. There are no signs of acquiring means or active steps, so this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (past access to blades and cutting) and current/future intentions (the upcoming test and conditional thoughts). It does not describe a full past suicide attempt, only self-harm, so it's not 'attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire not to live if failing) and mentions methods, but lacks a specific current plan or preparations. This best fits 'Ideation' based on the definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of frustration, exhaustion, and hopelessness related to school, work, family comparisons, and a perceived oppressive system. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include feelings of being drained, loss of motivation, and a sense of pointlessness in life, such as ""drained me the fuck out of all my motivation,"" ""taken my will to strive,"" and ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life."" There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, though there is general dissatisfaction and uncertainty about life, it does not directly express a desire to end one's life. Since the mentions are not explicit and could be considered vague, I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past experiences (e.g., school and work draining the user) and current feelings of hopelessness, but it does not describe past attempts or indicate future intentions related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, plans, or past attempts. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'indicator' since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, including slitting wrists, shooting with a gun, and cutting as ways to harm or kill oneself.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, as there's no mention of acquiring tools or writing notes, but the specific methods described indicate planning.
   - Since specific methods are outlined, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions, as indicated by ""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do,"" rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts along with specific methods (e.g., slitting wrists, shooting with a gun), which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes expressions of suicidal thoughts plus a plan.

There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""This world is shit,"" ""I'm so unlovable"") and despair, but nothing escalates to suicidal content.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on emotional pain and seeking love/validation, but does not include any desire to end life. Since it's unclear and leans toward general distress, I am choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post shows general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness without any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks explicit suicidal content and fits the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes multiple mentions of death, dying, and suicide, such as ""Death is a mercy I do not deserve,"" ""I wanna kill myself,"" and ""I'm really contemplating suicide."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, self-hatred, guilt, and despair, as seen in phrases like ""I hate myself,"" ""I want to die because I hate myself,"" and ""I've done everything but nothing works anymore."" Specific plans and methods are detailed, including calculating the amount of isopropyl alcohol for poisoning, testing attachment points for a noose, determining times to jump in front of a car, and figuring out ways to avoid being caught. There are references to ongoing suicidal thoughts over years but no explicit description of past suicide attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct phrases like ""I wanna kill myself"" and ""suicidal thoughts for years.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, including ingesting isopropyl alcohol, using a noose, and jumping in front of a car.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, such as calculating dosages, testing attachment points, and determining optimal times and ways to avoid interruption.
   - Since explicit plans are described, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., suicidal thoughts for years, mom's death earlier this year) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide"" and ongoing preparations). No specific past attempts are described, only prolonged thoughts and planning.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and includes detailed plans and preparations (e.g., specific methods like alcohol poisoning and noose testing), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly states ""This the most suicidal I've been in a couple months.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I just want to be out of my misery"" indicate a desire to end suffering, which aligns with suicidal thoughts.
   - The mention is clear, so it goes beyond vague indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any concrete means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The user mentions not contacting anyone, which suggests isolation but does not constitute explicit preparation like acquiring means or writing a note. Thus, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., not contacting anyone), but not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., being ""most suicidal"" and wanting out of misery), which fits the definition of ideation. There is no specific plan or method, so it does not qualify as behavior. It is more than just general distress, as suicide is explicitly mentioned, ruling out indicator. No past attempts are described, so attempt does not apply.

434,I just want to die. Why is it so hard to die. I just want to kill myself but I can't find a suitable way to go,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes direct mentions of wanting to die and killing oneself, such as ""I just want to die,"" ""Why is it so hard to die,"" and ""I just want to kill myself."" There are emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness, like frustration with the difficulty of dying. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, only a vague reference to not finding a ""suitable way to go."" There are no references to past attempts.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""I just want to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I just want to die"" and ""Why is it so hard to die.""
   - The mentions are clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools, locations, substances, or preparations are detailed; only a general statement about not finding a ""suitable way to go,"" which implies consideration but not explicit planning.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, such as no mention of acquiring means or writing notes.
   - Since there is no explicit plan, I will choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions, as the language is in the present tense (e.g., ""I just want to die""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailed planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of being at a ""low point,"" poor grammar, a need for advice, zero social skills, low self-esteem, loneliness, and concerns about moving to another country for better living, such as developing a second language. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include feelings of loneliness, low self-esteem, and general dissatisfaction, which suggest distress and hopelessness, but they are not tied to suicidal thoughts. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are present, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The content is focused on seeking advice for life improvements, so I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' due to the lack of any explicit suicidal language.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation for suicide? No. Since there is no indication of any planning, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if there were suicidal thoughts, but there aren't.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings (e.g., low point, loneliness) and future intentions (e.g., moving to another country). It does not describe past events or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress, sadness, and dissatisfaction with life but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desires to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' as it involves vague feelings of hopelessness without explicit suicidal content. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses anger and a wish for someone else to die a horrible and painful death. There are mentions of death (""die a horrible painful death ASAP""), but these are directed at another person, not the poster themselves. No mentions of suicide, self-harm, or the poster's own death. Emotional indicators include anger and resentment due to the account being banned, but there's no indication of personal hopelessness, despair, or distress related to the poster's own life. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the post does not mention suicide at all; it only wishes death upon another individual.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the expressions are about hoping someone else dies, not the poster. Since this is not about the poster's own suicidal thoughts, and the rules specify that the risk is only for the person writing the post, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No methods are mentioned, and even if they were, they would be in the context of another person, not the poster. No signs of preparation for any action by the poster. If there were any uncertainty, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here, there's no indication of suicidal thoughts for the poster.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a past event (the account being banned) and expresses a current wish for someone else's future death, but nothing about the poster's own past, current, or future suicidal intentions or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post lacks any explicit or implicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts by the poster. It only contains general distress (anger) not tied to suicide. According to the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because there are no direct mentions of suicide or the poster's desire to die. When in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over other categories, and here it's clear.

I have a problem, this women is bullying me and other people with her for couple of years now. I will kill her. I tried every possible thing to make her stop, but she is the most jealous person I have ever met in my life, so I will kill her, to finally live my life in peace. Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of anger, frustration, and a desire to harm someone else (a bully). There are mentions of killing the bully, references to the bully's jealousy, and a request for suggestions on how to murder her. There is a vague reference to ""type of suicide"" in the context of killing others, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the author themselves. Emotional indicators include distress and a desire for peace, but no explicit hopelessness or despair directed at the author's own life. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for the author's self-harm are present; instead, the focus is on harming another person. No references to past attempts by the author.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in the phrase ""for type of suicide,"" but it is not in the context of the author wanting to die or harm themselves; it seems to refer to a concept involving killing others. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post is about killing the bully, not the author's own suicide. Since this is not explicitly about the author's suicidal thoughts, and the rules emphasize that suicide risk is for the person writing the post, I lean toward 'indicator' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post asks for suggestions on how to murder the bully, which implies seeking methods for harming another person, not for the author's suicide. There are no signs of preparation for the author's self-harm. Since this is not related to the author's own suicide plan, and if uncertain, I choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'—but here, it doesn't qualify as either because it's not about self-harm.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and future intentions (e.g., ""I will kill her""), based on past experiences with bullying. There are no references to past attempts by the author, only to past efforts to stop the bullying.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses general distress and dissatisfaction with life due to bullying, but there are no explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, desires to die, or plans for the author's own harm. The mention of ""suicide"" is vague and not directed at the author, so it does not meet the criteria for 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt'. According to the definitions, this fits best as 'indicator' because there is no direct indication of the author's suicidal risk, and when in doubt, I choose 'indicator'.

Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair (""I seriously cannot do this anymore"", ""My mental health really bad"", ""I'm such a disappointment and failure"").

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""on the verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""I just want to end it all"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, though ""I know exactly what to do"" suggests a plan, it does not specify tools, substances, locations, or preparations. Since this is not explicit or detailed, I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""on the verge"", ""I just want to end it all""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires to die, which fits 'Ideation'. There is no detailed plan or preparation mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of wanting to die, which fits ideation (desire to not be alive without a specific plan). It does not qualify as indicator due to the direct expressions, behavior due to the lack of a plan, or attempt due to no past actions mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of distress related to sexuality, gender dysphoria, past trauma (being molested at 5 years old and raised by women), unhappiness, depression, loneliness, and rejection. Emotional indicators show hopelessness and despair, such as being ""tired of being unhappy, lost, and alone"" and ""always rejected."" There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted. References to past events include childhood molestation, but not as a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a desire to be ""normal"" and for God to remove their struggles, but this does not include explicit suicidal thoughts. Since it is unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post discusses chronic knee pain, an MRI diagnosis of a mild ACL sprain, ongoing pain despite efforts like stretching, and a duration of 8 months with no improvement. It includes a question: ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" which mentions suicide in a hypothetical or rhetorical manner. Emotional indicators include frustration and hopelessness, as seen in phrases like ""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts"" and ""no change in sight."" There are no mentions of death, dying, self-harm beyond the word ""suicidal"" in the question, no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used in the question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" but it is not a direct personal expression; it's phrased as a query about others. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, there are no direct statements from the poster indicating a personal desire to die; it's indirect and ambiguous.
   - Since this is unclear and not a very explicit personal mention, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to any tools, locations, substances, or plans related to suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates any preparations or actions.
   - Since there is no evidence of planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current and ongoing pain (e.g., ""it's been 8 months""), but the suicidal mention is in the present as a question without indicating future intentions. There are no references to past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes the word ""suicidal,"" but it is not an explicit, personal expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings; it's a vague, rhetorical question. Based on the definitions, this lacks the directness required for 'ideation.' General dissatisfaction and hopelessness are present, but without explicit suicide mention in a personal context, it fits 'indicator.' When in doubt, I choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

There are references to death and dying, such as starving oneself, hanging, and using a gun. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being a burden. Specific plans or methods mentioned: starving themselves (already started), hanging as a painful option, and preferring a gun for a quicker death. There are no references to past attempts; this is focused on current actions and future intentions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with direct references to hanging, using a gun, and starving to achieve death.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I just want my death to come faster"" and ""I'll at least be dead by the end of the week"" clearly express a desire to die.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of deep emotional distress such as melancholy, exhaustion from routine (work-sleep cycle), hopelessness, emotional numbness, anger, grief, and physical pain from nerve damage. There are explicit mentions of death and suicide, including phrases like ""I plan my suicide every single day"" and specific methods such as using a pistol, an escape bag, or dousing oneself in gasoline and lighting up. Emotional indicators show despair, a desire not to go on, and a sense of meaninglessness. Specific plans and methods are detailed, with no clear references to past attempts, though it discusses past injuries affecting the present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""I plan my suicide every single day."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I just don't want to go on anymore"" and descriptions of suicide methods. This is clear and not vague, so it goes beyond mere indicators.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including a pistol, an escape bag, and dousing in gasoline. Signs of preparation are implied through daily planning and references to these methods, indicating more than just thoughts. This constitutes explicit planning, so it aligns with 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current and ongoing feelings and intentions (e.g., daily planning), with some references to past events like injuries, but no description of past suicide attempts. The focus is on present/future plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire not to go on) and specific plans (e.g., methods like a pistol), which fits the 'behavior' category. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'ideation' because of the detailed plans, or 'attempt' since no past actions are described.

""Lack of proof"" . and they didn't even search for proof. &amp;#x200B;. I can't go on like this. I'm 27 years old. I have nightmares every night, I have nobody . only my best friend who understands me. he's the reason why I'm still here. I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it. Today was a Fwb visiting me and I felt so dirty and I didn't feel secure and he touched me but stoped when I didnt react. I didn't feel like talking so I kept everything to myseld. When he said he would leave, I asked him if he wouldn't wanna talk about it and he just said that he is mentally drain (15 years realtionship then break up) but I can't do this right now. Humans only care about you, when they get something from you. God left me alone, he never answered my prayers. I was in therapy on and off since I was 15. I gave hypnosis a try in hope it would make things better. But my life is just full of rape, abuse and suffering. and I'm such a chicken. I just can't pull myself togehter and just do it.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include explicit descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., trying to cut wrists at age 11, laying on a road at 19, jumping in front of a train at 24), a recent action (standing on a chair with a rope around the neck), and ongoing suicidal thoughts. There are mentions of death and dying (e.g., ""I would wanna go to the angels,"" ""I've been suicidale all my life""), emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, trauma from rape and abuse, nightmares, and isolation. Specific methods are referenced (rope, cutting, jumping in front of a train), and there's a mention of preparation or intent in the recent event. References to past attempts are detailed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with words like ""suicidale"" and descriptions of attempts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""I can't go on like this"" and ""I just can't pull myself together and just do it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, including a rope for hanging, cutting wrists, and jumping in front of a train.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the recent action of standing on a chair with a rope indicates preparation.
   - Since explicit planning is present, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (e.g., attempts at various ages) and current/future intentions (e.g., the recent rope incident and thoughts of doing it after dinner).
   - Past attempts are specifically described, and current plans are also mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post describes multiple past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans (e.g., the rope incident), and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts and also mentions current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. This overrides other categories like 'Behavior' or 'Ideation' based on the provided guidelines.

447,"Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?. I feel like I'm at the point in my life where if I die then I die. As of right now I don't have any plans to end it, but I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come. Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier. I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of acceptance of death, such as ""if I die then I die"" and ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" along with emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, like ""the future is really grim"" and ""it's not worth pushing my life further."" There are mentions of death and dying, but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts. The user notes stopping visits to the doctor, which could imply passive risk but doesn't detail any active steps.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, as terms like ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself"" are not used, though ""end it"" could imply it indirectly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""if I die then I die"" and accepting early death suggest a desire not to prolong life. Since it's not fully explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if in doubt, but ""end it"" provides enough indication to consider suicidal thoughts present.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? The user mentions stopping doctor visits, which might be passive, but it's not a specific plan like acquiring tools or writing a note. Since no explicit plan is described and the user states ""I don't have any plans to end it,"" this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future acceptance of death, with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses a desire to not prolong life and includes indirect suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""end it""), fitting the definition of ideation as it involves explicit feelings of not wanting to be alive without a specific plan. It's not indicator because of the implied suicidal reference, not behavior due to the absence of plans, and not attempt as no past actions are described.

I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, too depressed to have actual friends, to ugly to have a significant other, and too lazy and my thyroid is too fucked up to make losing weight an option unless I starve myself or something",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses strong self-hatred, depression, feelings of inadequacy (e.g., being a coward, too ugly, too lazy), and mentions physical health issues (thyroid problems). There are explicit references to suicide with ""kill myself"" and a potential self-harm method with ""starve myself or something."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods beyond vague self-starvation, or preparations are detailed. No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (implied in self-hatred and the statement about being a coward to kill oneself).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? There is a vague mention of ""starve myself or something,"" which could imply a method, but it's not detailed or clearly tied to suicide planning. No signs of preparation like acquiring tools or writing notes. Since this is not a concrete or explicit plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. No description of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself""), indicating a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or preparations. This aligns with 'Ideation' as there are no detailed methods or behaviors described. It does not qualify as 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, 'Behavior' due to the absence of a clear plan, or 'Attempt' as no past actions are referenced.

449,"The simplest ways to help a friend who is struggling are often the most forgotten. A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include advice on helping a friend who is struggling with thoughts of suicide. It mentions ""thinking about suicide"" in the context of others, not the poster themselves. There are no direct mentions of death, dying, or self-harm from the poster's perspective. Emotional indicators include references to distress in friends, such as the need for hugs and support, but these are general and not personal to the poster. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post mentions ""thinking about suicide,"" but it is in reference to a friend, not the poster. 
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, as this is not expressed by the poster themselves.
   - Since the suicide risk must correspond only to the person writing the post (as per the rules), this mention does not apply to the poster, so it leans toward not being an explicit expression for classification purposes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - There is no indication of any planning or behavior related to suicide from the poster.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to general advice for current or hypothetical situations involving friends, not past events, current intentions, or future plans of the poster.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post discusses suicide in a third-person context (helping a friend), but does not involve any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or behaviors from the poster. According to the rules, the risk must be for the person writing the post. Therefore, it lacks explicit suicide expression concerning the poster. This fits best under 'Indicator', as there are no direct indicators of the poster's own risk, and when in doubt, we choose 'Indicator' over other categories.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of death and dying, such as ""no reason to live,"" ""killing myself,"" ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" and ""it's time to die."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, isolation, and distress, like feeling like a ""waste of life,"" having no one, and experiencing worsening mental health. There are no specific plans or methods mentioned, such as tools, locations, or substances for suicide. References to self-harm behaviors include stopping medication, drinking heavily, and taking the last Ativan, but these are not explicitly linked to a suicide plan. No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes – phrases like ""killing myself"" and ""suicide is their life's purpose"" directly reference suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes – expressions such as ""no reason to live"" and ""it's time to die"" indicate a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No – There are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any concrete methods for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Possibly, with mentions of stopping medication and taking the last Ativan, which could imply risky behavior, but this is not explicitly tied to a suicide plan. Since the instructions emphasize choosing 'ideation' if uncertain about explicit planning, I will not classify this as preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This primarily refers to current feelings and intentions, such as ongoing distress and thoughts of suicide, rather than past events. While past events (e.g., partner's departure) are described, the suicidal thoughts are presented as present-day.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which fits 'Ideation.' There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior.' It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die. It is not 'Attempt' as no past attempts are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of death and dying through descriptions of drowning as a method, such as ""drowning yourself,"" ""guaranteed death,"" and ""transition to death."" Emotional indicators show a positive view of death as ""peaceful"" and a ""nice smooth transition,"" suggesting despair or hopelessness. Specific plans or methods are referenced, including drowning in the ocean as the ""best option"" and a conditional plan if the person gets kicked out of their house. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (Yes), as the post discusses ""drowning yourself"" and presents it as a personal option. There are direct expressions of wanting to die (Yes), with phrases like it being a ""guaranteed death"" and something they might do.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (Yes), including drowning in the ocean, with details like ""slowly sinking to the bottom."" Signs of preparation are not explicitly described, such as acquiring means, but the post outlines a conditional plan (""If I get kicked out, I think I might go and do that""). Since a specific method is detailed, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions, as it discusses a potential action if a future event occurs (getting kicked out), with no mention of past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (drowning in the ocean) along with a conditional plan, which aligns with the 'behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing how and under what circumstances the action might occur.

We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of extreme despair, hopelessness, and frustration due to the ongoing pandemic, lockdowns, unemployment fears, university pressure, and a sense of meaninglessness in life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which fits the definition of ""Ideation.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include mentions of ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" which directly reference suicide and self-harm. Emotional indicators show a mix of excitement about Star Wars and underlying hopelessness, as the user implies that Star Wars is a reason to delay suicidal actions. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post implies thoughts of suicide that could be postponed.
   - The mentions are clear, so this is not just an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like acquiring means or writing notes is indicated.
   - Since there's no explicit plan, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions, as in ""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade,"" rather than past events. No past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts""), fitting the definition of ideation, which involves desires to end one's life without a specific plan. It does not qualify as behavior due to the absence of any mentioned methods or preparations, and it does not describe a past attempt, so it's not attempt. Therefore, ideation is the best fit.

There are mentions of no will to live, being tired of living, and wanting to end it all. Emotional indicators include feelings of exhaustion, dissatisfaction with life (e.g., no friends, shitty job, family, etc.), and a sense of being a worthless loser. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts related to suicide or self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, phrases like ""I have absolutely no will to live anymore"" and ""I just want to end it all"" indicate a desire to not be alive, which aligns with explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as seen in ""want to end it all"" and ""tired of living like this every day."" Although not using the word ""suicide,"" these are direct enough to qualify as explicit under the ideation definition.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and future dread (e.g., enduring another 50-60 years), but it does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, such as a desire to end it all, but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits best under 'Ideation' as defined, since there are clear desires to not be alive without detailing how to act on them. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit nature of the suicidal expressions, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as seen in the explicit language used.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no plan is evident, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die), which rules out 'indicator.'
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of paranoia (landlord trying to evict, neighbors keeping the user awake), extreme tiredness from sleep deprivation, a recent MS diagnosis, feelings of hopelessness and being trapped (""I cant take this torture,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell""), and a desire to escape (""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""I want to leave""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators show despair and exhaustion, but no specific plans, methods, or preparations are noted. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; phrases like ""I just wanna leave this place"" and ""I want to leave"" suggest a desire to escape the situation, but they are vague and not directly tied to ending one's life. Since it's unclear and not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of planning. If uncertain, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but nothing here suggests even ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current and ongoing issues (e.g., being kept awake now, recent diagnosis), with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and a vague desire to leave, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this best fits 'Indicator' as there are no explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings expressed. When in doubt about explicit mentions, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include feelings of isolation and lack of love (""My parents don't love me. I have nobody""), explicit mention of a potential suicide date (""Possible suicide date is in July""), internal conflict about proceeding due to friends (""Too bad I'm fucking debating it because of my friends""), identity struggles (""I'll never be a real woman. I don't know who I am anymore""), and clinging to hope. There are mentions of suicide, emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, but no specific methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as in ""Possible suicide date is in July"" and ""debating it,"" which directly implies suicide. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, through the context of debating suicide and overall despair.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, substances, or locations. Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs, only a vague date is referenced. Since this is not a clear plan, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., a possible date in July), not past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method. This aligns with 'Ideation,' as it involves suicidal feelings without detailed planning. It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of suicide, not 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan, and not 'Attempt' as there are no past actions described.

459,Happy people makes me suicidal. Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts because I know I will always be a loser who will never make friends. It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include mentions of ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself,"" and emotional indicators like sadness, feeling like a loser, hopelessness, and the belief that life won't improve. There are no mentions of death or dying beyond the suicide reference, no specific plans or methods, and no references to past attempts. The post expresses distress tied to seeing happy people and internal conflict due to religious beliefs.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""I will probably never kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the post describes having suicidal thoughts and implies a desire to end life, though restrained by religion.
   - Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, this clearly goes beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing indicates steps toward acting on thoughts.
   - Without any explicit planning, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts""), with no reference to past events or attempts. It's focused on ongoing struggles rather than history.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Behavior' due to no planning, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

460,"A great way to end an awful year. I had so many friends before now. I had lived my entire life a lonely bastard at school but this quarantine i finally got some online friends and guess what? Fucked it up. I sent my (ex) boyfriend creepy messages because i'm a fucking idiot and of course no one wanted to be friends with me anymore. I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic. No one from my real life, no classmates or family, none of them. just some random woman who lives on an entire different continent. I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve. I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses loneliness, regret over lost friendships, and exhaustion from failing others. It mentions ""ending it all on New Year's Eve,"" references to three previous suicide notes, and describes the year as a ""downward spiral."" There are mentions of death and suicide through phrases like ""ending it all"" and ""suicide notes."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. Specific plans or preparations: ""Ending it all on New Year's Eve"" indicates a time, and ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"" suggests past preparations. References to past attempts: Mentions of previous suicide notes, but these are preparations, not confirmed concrete actions like an overdose.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""ending it all"" and ""suicide notes.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as in ""I'm thinking of ending it all on New Year's Eve"" and the overall desire to end the year this way.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit methods (e.g., tools or substances), but a specific time is mentioned (""on New Year's Eve""). 
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, with references to making suicide notes (three previous ones and this one). This qualifies as preparations, so it leans toward 'Behavior' rather than just 'Ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past events (lost friendships, previous suicide notes) and current/future intentions (planning to end it on New Year's Eve). The suicide notes are in the past, but they don't constitute a concrete attempt; the focus is on current planning.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die, along with preparations (suicide notes) and a specified time, which indicates planning. This fits 'Behavior' as it involves explicit thoughts plus preparations. It's not just 'Ideation' due to the preparations, and it's not 'Attempt' since no concrete past action is described, despite the rule for past attempts with current plans—here, the past elements are preparations, not attempts.

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a mention of self-harm (""tried to cut myself""), emotional indicators such as a ""breakdown,"" a ""very bad night,"" and feelings of wanting to ""feel something real."" There are no direct mentions of death, dying, or suicide, but self-harm is referenced as a past action. No specific plans, methods beyond the act itself, or preparations are detailed. There is a reference to this being a past attempt, as it occurred ""last night"" and is described as a first-time event.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No; the post focuses on self-harm during emotional distress, not a desire to end life. Since it's not explicit, I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context of self-harm as a past action needs further evaluation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned (""cut myself""), but this is in the context of a past event, not current planning. There are no signs of preparation or ongoing intent. If uncertain about explicit planning, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but this doesn't apply here as it's historical.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to a past event (""last night""), with no indication of current or future intentions. It describes a past attempt at self-harm, which aligns with historical actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete past action of self-harm (""tried to cut myself""), which qualifies as a past attempt under the definitions. Although suicide isn't explicitly mentioned, the category for 'Attempt' focuses on historic actions like this, and self-harm in this context fits as a suicide-related attempt. There's no mention of current plans, so it doesn't overlap with other categories. Based on the analysis, 'Attempt' is the best fit.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""plan to kill myself."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through statements like ""no purpose to live"" and the overall intent expressed.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details on tools, locations, substances, or preparations. The post mentions a ""plan"" but lacks specifics, so I must choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the guidelines when unsure about explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""plan to kill myself""), with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a general desire to die, but without any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'Ideation' category, as it involves desires to end one's life without the details required for 'Behavior'.

Specifically, there are mentions of suicide (""I want to kill myself""), emotional indicators like hopelessness and daily struggles with loneliness, specific plans or preparations (""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching,"" and ""Already started to cancel friendships""), and no references to past attempts or self-harm methods.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself"") and mentions of a plan (setting a date and canceling friendships), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves both thoughts and explicit preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used directly. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Based on the analysis, the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (method and preparation), which fits the 'behavior' category.

The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school. I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of severe stress, anxiety, isolation, and emotional distress from school, family, and personal identity issues. The user mentions ""I thought of killing myself multiple times,"" which directly references suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., crying themselves to sleep, no motivation), despair (e.g., feeling crushed by stress), and reliance on their little brother as the only reason to live. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present; it's focused on past thoughts without action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the user states ""I thought of killing myself multiple times,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the phrase about their brother being the only thing keeping them alive and not knowing how long they can cope.
   - This is explicit enough to move beyond 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any means of suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, nothing like writing a note or acquiring items for self-harm.
   - Since no plan is evident, this aligns with 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to past thoughts (e.g., over the last 2 years) and current worsening feelings, but not to any concrete past attempts or future intentions with specifics.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., thinking of killing themselves) but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the definition of 'ideation'. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide reference, not 'behavior' due to no plan, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

474,"Where can I find out how to die. I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post: The post mentions ""how to die"" and expresses a desire to ""definitely die."" There are no mentions of suicide explicitly, self-harm, or specific methods. Emotional indicators include indifference to pain or slowness, suggesting despair and hopelessness.
   - No references to past attempts or preparations.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with phrases like ""I just want to definitely die.""
   - Although not explicitly ""suicide,"" this is a direct expression of a desire to die, which aligns with suicidal thoughts. However, per the rules, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.' Given the clear desire to die, I interpret this as explicit enough for consideration beyond 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about tools, locations, substances, or preparations; it's only inquiring about how to die.
   - No signs of preparation.
   - Since no specific plan is evident, if it fits a category, it should be 'ideation' over 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., wanting to die now), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die, which fits the definition of 'ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It goes beyond general distress (which would be 'indicator') but lacks any planning (which would make it 'behavior'). Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit.

475,"It Never Quite Goes Away. I stick around for other people, but not because I want to be alive. It's not just that I don't see a future for myself, I just don't really want one either. It does get better, and then it gets worse, and then it gets better, and then worse, etc. I'm tired of buying time from myself over and over again. I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty. Maybe it's that 'indifference toward other people' that they were talking about when I got diagnosed with PTSD (still reeling from that one, it never seemed bad enough to me. Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail. And in the meantime, I guess I'm still trying. I'm always trying.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include expressions of not wanting to be alive, a ""will to die,"" tiredness of fighting, and references to past attempts (""if I do attempt again""). Emotional indicators show hopelessness, despair, and indifference due to PTSD. There are no explicit mentions of specific methods, tools, or locations for self-harm, but there is a vague timeline for a potential future action (""it'll be at least a few months out""). References to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""will to die,"" ""attempt again,"" and ""if I do it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""not because I want to be alive"" and ""familiar will to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, no tools, substances, or locations are detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is a vague indication of a timeline (""a few months out"") and having ""made enough plans to look forward to,"" but this seems to refer to life plans delaying action rather than suicide preparations. Since it's not explicit, I lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to both past events (implied past attempts via ""attempt again"") and current/future intentions (ongoing thoughts and a potential future attempt). The post combines historical references with present feelings and vague future plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and implies past attempts, while also vaguely referencing current plans. According to the definitions, since it refers to past attempts and mentions current plans, it fits the 'attempt' category best, as the rules specify to label it as 'attempt' in such cases.

476,"My temptations will soon get the better of me. Every day the pain gets worse. For the past week, I haven't thought about anything other than how and when I'm going to take my life. It's peaceful to think about, to imagine myself free from everything. I can't see myself going on to live a normal life, or much of a life at all. I've fucked my education up, I've fucked my relationships with other people up, I've fucked up everything in my life. I simply won't live a comfortable life in the slightest, it'll only continue to get worse as it always has. At the stage I'm at, I don't even want to live a comfortable life anymore, I don't want any more chances. I just want the pain to stop. I'm only 16 and I've gone through enough of it to last multiple lifetimes. I'm too afraid to use any method aside from a gun to the head, though. Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days until I'm able to. But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there. Where the fuck did everything go so wrong?",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of increasing pain, constant thoughts about taking one's life, imagining freedom from pain, hopelessness about the future, regrets about education and relationships, a desire for the pain to stop, and specific references to methods of suicide. There are mentions of death and dying through phrases like ""take my life"" and ""do it"" with a kitchen knife. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and a lack of desire to continue living. Specific plans or methods mentioned: a plan involving a gun to the head after 480 days, and temptation to use a kitchen knife immediately. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""take my life"" and the context of planning to end it. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, such as ""I don't even want to live anymore"" and ""I just want the pain to stop.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Specific methods are mentioned, including a gun to the head and a kitchen knife. Signs of preparation include having a timeline (waiting 480 days for the gun) and current temptation to act with the knife. This goes beyond mere thoughts, indicating a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post primarily refers to current and future intentions, such as ongoing thoughts and the planned wait period, rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, along with specific methods (gun and knife) and a timeline for action, which qualifies as explicit planning. This fits the 'Behavior' category, as it includes both suicidal thoughts and a mentioned plan, per the definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include mentions of ""thoughts of suicide,"" which directly references suicidal ideation. Emotional indicators are present, such as feelings of hopelessness, failure, and difficulty in finding the courage to live, as seen in phrases like ""convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do."" There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide, and no references to past attempts. The post focuses on seeking help through inpatient care and medication.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as the post refers to ""thoughts of suicide."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, indirectly through the user's struggle to find courage to live and convince themselves they deserve to live, implying a desire not to be alive. Since this is explicit enough to indicate suicidal thoughts, it leans toward ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation. The post discusses general help-seeking rather than planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current thoughts and feelings, such as ongoing struggles and questions about future help, rather than past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" and expresses a desire-related struggle to live, fitting the definition of Ideation, which involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It does not qualify as Indicator because suicide is explicitly mentioned, nor as Behavior due to the absence of any plan or preparation, and not as Attempt since no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of emotional distress such as monotony, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""Another day of being mute,"" ""Everyday is the same,"" ""Nothing to say ever,"" ""I'm 40 and unemployed,"" ""Can't sleep. No future""). There are explicit mentions of suicide, specifically ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge,"" which directly references death and a method. Emotional indicators include despair and a sense of no future. There are no references to past attempts or self-harm beyond this.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday."" Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, as it expresses an intent to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Bridge"" likely refers to a method of suicide (e.g., jumping). Are there signs of preparation? The post specifies a timeline (""on Monday""), which indicates planning, though no additional preparations like acquiring tools are detailed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to a future intention (""on Monday""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to kill oneself) and mentions a specific plan (method: bridge; time: Monday). This aligns with the 'Behavior' category, as it involves both suicidal thoughts and explicit planning. It does not fit 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention, 'Ideation' because a plan is specified, or 'Attempt' since it's not about a past event.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""hangman's noose"" as a wallpaper, which is a symbol and potential method for suicide by hanging. It includes ""kms"" (likely meaning ""kill myself""), indicating explicit suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, such as struggles with a girl, life decisions, being non-religious in a religious country, and regrets like wishing for more experiences before ""going."" There are references to overcoming a ""big hurdle to kms,"" suggesting removal of barriers to suicide, and phrases like ""when I do it"" and ""before I go,"" implying future action. No clear references to past attempts are present, but there's a mix of current emotional distress and potential planning.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""kms"" and indirect references like ""when I do it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes, via ""kms,"" ""before I go,"" and the context of staying ""on track"" with a noose wallpaper.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hangman's noose"" is a specific method for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, such as setting the wallpaper ""to stay on track,"" overcoming a hurdle to kms, and ensuring his mom won't be affected, which could indicate planning or removing obstacles.
   - Since methods and preparations are mentioned, this goes beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to recent past actions (overcoming a hurdle) and current/future intentions (e.g., ""when I do it""), rather than a completed past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit suicidal expressions (""kms"") and includes specific methods (noose) and signs of preparation (overcoming hurdles), which fits the 'behavior' category as it involves planning. It's not just thoughts without a plan, so it's not 'ideation.' There's no description of a past concrete attempt, so it's not 'attempt.' It's beyond general distress, so not 'indicator.'

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time.

   - Key elements in this post include multiple mentions of death, dying, and suicide, such as descriptions of past attempts (aspirin overdose, gun purchase and attempt, rope hanging), current preparations (exit bag setup), and emotional indicators like hopelessness, despair, loneliness, anxiety, numbness from depression and depersonalization. Specific plans and methods are detailed, including tools (aspirin, gun, rope, exit bag with gas), research on aiming a gun or hanging techniques, and preparations like purchasing items and setting up the exit bag. References to past attempts are explicit and detailed.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die,"" and descriptions of attempts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, such as ""my desire to die"" and feelings of exhaustion and loneliness leading to suicidal actions.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, including aspirin overdose, gun with researched aiming, rope for hanging, and exit bag with gas.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, such as purchasing a gun, rope, and setting up the exit bag, along with research on methods.
   - Since specific plans and preparations are described, this goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (attempts at 15, 21, and recently) and current/future intentions (exit bag setup and ongoing fears).
   - Past attempts are specifically described in detail.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (e.g., aspirin overdose, gun incident, rope hanging), which fits the 'Attempt' category. It also mentions current plans (exit bag), and per the definitions, when a post refers to past attempts and current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'.

No specific self-harm tools are mentioned, but the act of ""working out until I die or pass out"" suggests a potential method of self-inflicted harm through exhaustion. There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., the word ""suicide"" is absent), but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or face death, such as ""face death"" and the implication in ""until I die."" This leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts, as the language conveys a desire to end life, though not crystal clear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: A specific method is mentioned: ""working out until I die or pass out,"" which could be interpreted as a plan to harm oneself through physical exertion leading to death or unconsciousness. There are signs of preparation, as the person states they are starting now and will return in 12 hours if they survive, indicating an immediate intention. Since this describes a concrete action, it qualifies as a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current and future intentions, as it describes an action the person is about to take (""I'm now gonna start working out"") rather than past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and mentions a plan (working out to the point of death), which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. It goes beyond mere ideation due to the described method and preparation, even if not a traditional tool. If unsure, I would choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here the plan is evident.

If I wait 10 years I'll never be able to retire. but why should I save up so much money only leaving myself enough to get by if I plan to be dead long before I retire. I'm sorry for the question but I was hoping someone would be able to talk and help me figure it out.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions suicide explicitly (""I have contemplated suicide for years, I know I am going to do it""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and resignation, such as questioning the point of saving for retirement if they plan to die young. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or substances). There are no references to past attempts, only past contemplation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with phrases like ""contemplated suicide"" and ""I know I am going to do it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as the user implies they will end their life before retirement.
   - This is clear and explicit, so it goes beyond just vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no details about ways, tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, only vague timing (e.g., ""maybe in my 20's or 30's"") is referenced, but no active steps like acquiring means or writing a note.
   - Since no explicit plan is described, this leans toward ideation rather than behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past contemplation (""I have contemplated suicide for years"") and future intentions (""I know I am going to do it,"" with possible timing in 20's or 30's). There are no descriptions of past attempts, only ongoing thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of specific methods or preparations. It is not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include a question about whether duloxetine (a medication) can kill, which implies interest in its lethality. There are no direct mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm, but the phrase ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" suggests potential preparation for self-harm. Emotional indicators like hopelessness are absent. No specific plans, methods, or preparations are detailed beyond the pills, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The content is indirect, focusing on the lethality of a substance, so I lean toward 'indicator' if unclear, but the context of saving pills adds nuance.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, duloxetine pills are implied as a potential method for lethality. Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""saving for later"" suggests preparation. Since this involves a specific means (pills), it goes beyond vague thoughts, but if uncertain about explicit planning, I should choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. However, the mention of a method and preparation qualifies it as more than just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current possession (having pills) and future intentions (""saving for later""), with no reference to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post does not explicitly mention suicide, which leans toward 'indicator', but it includes a specific method (duloxetine pills) and signs of preparation (saving them), aligning with 'behavior'. According to the definitions, if specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present, it should be classified as 'behavior'. Therefore, this fits 'behavior' best.

No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned, and there are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with ""I just want to end but haven't yet,"" which expresses a desire to end life. Since this is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no mention of any plan or method, this does not qualify as 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to current feelings and intentions, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to end life) without any specific plan, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation.' It goes beyond general distress, so it's not 'Indicator.' There is no plan, so it's not 'Behavior,' and no past attempt is described, so it's not 'Attempt.'

It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions thoughts of dying and suicide, specifically phrases like ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas."" Emotional indicators include procrastination, fatigue, hopelessness, and a sense of distraction through a side project. There are references to death and suicide but no mentions of self-harm or past attempts. The post implies a method involving ""buy the gas,"" which could relate to a suicide plan.
   
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as ""off myself"" is slang for suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, with statements like ""I could be dead by the end of the day today.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post references ""buy the gas,"" indicating a potential method for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? There is an implication of needing to acquire gas, which suggests a plan, though not fully prepared.
   - Since a specific method is mentioned, this leans toward 'behavior' rather than 'ideation.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current or future intentions, as it discusses possibilities for today, with no references to past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""buy the gas""), which meets the criteria for 'behavior' as it involves explicit planning. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a means, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements include the user's struggles with school, self-harm (cutting their leg), emotional detachment, and explicit plans for suicide. There are mentions of death and suicide (e.g., planning to kill themselves), emotional indicators like unmotivation and a ""weird happy"" feeling, specific plans (hanging with a rope, cutting off a finger with an axe in the forest), and preparations (everything is ready, including the rope, axe, and car). References to past self-harm are present but not full suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""I planned to kill myself,"" ""I plan to hang myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., planning to end it and having everything ready).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods mentioned? Yes (hanging with a rope, using an axe to cut off a finger, in the forest, with a car involved).
   - Signs of preparation? Yes (the user states ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"").
   - This clearly indicates explicit planning, so it goes beyond ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (e.g., past self-harm and a January plan that didn't happen) and current/future intentions (e.g., ongoing faking of school and current plan to hang themselves). No concrete past suicide attempt is described, only self-harm and unexecuted plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a detailed plan with preparations, which fits 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions, not 'Ideation' due to the specific plan, and not 'Attempt' as no concrete past suicide attempt occurred, despite the rule for combined past and current elements—here, past elements are self-harm, not attempts.

We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include expressions of existential despair, the pointlessness of life, and a philosophical view on death and human existence. Specifically, the user mentions ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"" and ""I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die."" There are mentions of dying and a vague wish to not have been born, indicating emotional indicators like hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life. However, there are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or any direct equivalent is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? There is a vague expression in ""I wish I was never born,"" but it is immediately contradicted by ""don't really want to die,"" making it unclear. Following the instructions, if unclear, I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any form of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior,' but since no planning is present, this does not apply here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post discusses current feelings and philosophical thoughts about life and death, but there are no references to past events, future intentions, or past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - Based on the analysis, the post shows general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. According to the definitions, this fits 'Indicator' because suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and when in doubt, we choose 'indicator' over 'ideation.' There are no elements of plans, behaviors, or past attempts present.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of shame, embarrassment, and fear related to a personal mistake (buying a used adult toy) that has led to social judgment and bullying. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include feelings of shame, disgust, and anxiety about starting a new school, but these are tied to social perceptions rather than suicidal thoughts. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on social distress and seeking advice, with no indication of suicidal thoughts. Since there's no explicit mention, I lean toward 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. There's no reference to any suicide-related plans, so this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to past events (the purchase and its consequences) and current/future concerns (starting a new school and fear of judgment), but there are no references to past suicide attempts or current/future suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and sadness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. Based on the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator' as it involves emotional indicators like shame and hopelessness about life circumstances without referencing suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in this post include frustration with family, being brought into the world, getting sick of life, and not being allowed to kill oneself.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, with the phrase ""kill yourself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied through the context of wanting to end suffering and criticizing others for preventing it.
   - This is clear, so no need to lean toward 'indicator.'

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No evidence of this.
   - Since there's no explicit planning, this fits 'ideation' rather than 'behavior.'

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and general frustrations, not past events or future intentions specifically. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit mentions of suicide and desires related to wanting to die, but lacks any specific plan or method, so it best fits 'Ideation.' It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicide reference, not 'Behavior' without a plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements in this post include expressions of loneliness, hopelessness, and a desire for life to end. Phrases like ""im going to do it"" and ""pls fucking end me"" suggest suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include despair and feelings of being uncared for. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, or preparations, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""im going to do it"" and ""pls fucking end me"" indicate a desire for life to end. Since this is not entirely unclear, it leans toward explicit suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No, there are no references to tools, locations, substances, or any preparations. Since there is no evidence of a specific plan, this would lean toward 'ideation' if borderline.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This post refers to current feelings and possible future intentions (e.g., ""im going to do it"" and ""end me before the day""), rather than past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post includes explicit expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""pls fucking end me""), which fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses a hope that the user will be the next victim of stabbings in their area, contrasting this with suicide to avoid family shame. It mentions death indirectly through the idea of being stabbed and explicitly references suicide as an alternative they want to avoid. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and a desire to die without personal responsibility. There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, and no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post directly says ""with a suicide"" as something they want to avoid.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user hopes to be stabbed, indicating a desire for death through external means.
   - The mention is explicit, so this goes beyond just a vague indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post references stabbings as a potential way to die, but this is not a plan the user is initiating themselves; it's a hope for an external event. No signs of preparation, such as acquiring tools or writing notes, are present.
   - Since there's no evidence of the user planning or preparing a suicide method themselves, this does not qualify as behavior.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current hopes for a future event (being the next stabbing victim), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die via stabbing to avoid suicide), but lacks any specific plan or preparation for the user to act on it themselves. This aligns with 'Ideation' as defined, since there's a clear desire to not be alive without detailing a self-initiated method. It's not 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicide mention, not 'Behavior' due to no plan, and not 'Attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: 
   - Key elements in the post include explicit mentions of suicide (""killmyself"" and ""kill myself with peace""), a desire to end life (""i want to put an end to it all""), and emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., no friends, no social life, no skills, no job, no money). There are also references to disappearing and making death look like an accident, but no specific methods like tools or substances are detailed. No past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: 
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (e.g., ""killmyself"" and ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die? Yes (e.g., ""i want to put an end to it all"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No direct methods (e.g., no tools or substances), but preparations are implied, such as going to another country and getting a new identity to facilitate suicide without detection, which could be seen as planning. Since this involves steps for execution, it leans toward explicit planning, but it's not highly detailed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: 
   - This refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""how can i just disappear?"" and plans to kill themselves), not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: 
   - The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions preparations (e.g., disappearing to another country for suicide), which aligns with 'behavior' as it includes explicit planning. Although the planning is not extremely specific, it meets the criteria for preparations, so 'behavior' fits best over 'ideation'.

There are also expressions of wanting to die and frustration with not succeeding.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself,"" ""I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL,"" and references to killing oneself).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (e.g., suffocation method for the past attempt, and Plan B described as more painful for future use). Are there signs of preparation? The post implies preparation for the past attempt and outlines intentions for future ones, such as trying again tonight.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: This refers to both past events (the attempt last night) and current/future intentions (planning to try again tonight and having a backup plan). Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a past suicide attempt, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Additionally, it mentions current plans (e.g., trying again tonight and Plan B), and per the rules, when a post refers to past attempts but also includes current plans, it should be labeled as 'Attempt'. This overrides other potential fits like 'Behavior' due to the explicit rule for combined elements.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses general dissatisfaction and emotional distress but does not explicitly mention suicide, so I lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the guidelines.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: Are specific methods mentioned? No. Are there signs of preparation? No. Since there is no indication of any planning, and the guidelines instruct to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings (e.g., tiredness and emptiness) and potential future concerns (e.g., another depressive episode), but it does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans. According to the definitions, this fits best under 'Indicator', as very large general dissatisfaction without explicit suicide references defaults to this category.
