43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,ideation,ideation,True
74,"Hoping to be murdered. I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die.

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames.

The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit.

I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain . I'm so scared I've never done anything like this before and I'm so scared of the pain I will cause to my parents and family . Thank you for listening and I hope I can get the peace i need .",2,behavior,behavior,behavior,True
353,"Please help, I'm at my rope's end. Basically,. I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me). I was loyal and did that. &amp;#x200B;. And suffered through all of this hell because of that decision",1,ideation,ideation,ideation,True
354,I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm a fuck up who can never get anything right. I feel like my mom thinks I'm a genuinely stupid human being who can't think for herself. I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree. I want to tell a suicide hotline but I don't want to be locked up in a mental facility and never be able to get out.

366,"My problems are getting worse, and I just really wish to end my life, but I just can't. Every day, I'm struggling more and more with my problems. I was emotionally neglected by my parents, and searching for the love and attention I never got is the only thing keeping my alive. Every thing I do is controlled by this. It usually starts by seeing someone getting praised for something, which leads to me thinking that I need to be able to do/ have these things to be loved. Every time I see things as simple as a drawing, just gets me more and more depressed. I can't go to a therapist or something like that, because my mom's mad at me for being even sad in the slightest. I can't talk a single word about mental health at all, without being scared that she will scream at me another time. I feel like I'm unimportant. Other people have problems much worse than mine. They deserve being cared for, unlike me. Hearing other people's problems just makes me feel sad, and envious, because these people are getting all this love that I never got, and I never will get. I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this. The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest.

368,It's too hard. This is too hard I want to tell them everything not in writing but on the phone so they can hear the sincerity of my voice. My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship. I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it. And my mom didn't even tell my brother the whole truth. They can't keep hiding it and brushing it off. It's not helping!,0,indicator,behavior,behavior,True
375,"I been suicidal since I was since about 10 or 11. So remember when I was 10 or 11 I came home from school just to find out that my teacher called my mom because I failed the spelling bee test, so while I was in my backyard with my narcissistic mom scolded I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning since it was pretty deep and I didn't know how to swim. So some how she convince me not to. Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep suicide by a train is on my mind.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,ideation,ideation,True

411,"suicidal thoughts. HI i'm a 15 year old girl and all my entire life i have been dreaming of becoming a high fashion model when i grow up but there's a problem only tall people can walk the ramp short people are not allowed. Ik that i can be a commercial model if i want to because there is no height requirements but i really2 want to be a high fashion one because that's what i've always wanted ,my whole entire life. If i don't choose the carreer that i want i know that i will never be happy with my life. I haven't grow since last year and to make it worse im only 4'11 feet and the height requirements for runway models are 5'7 to 5'8 or 9. I feel so hopeless with myself that's why i want to give up my life and just die. And that's not the only reason, all my friends are getting taller then me and i am losing my self esteem very fast. I REALLY WANT TO DIE but i can't leave my parents too,im their only child and if they lose me i don't even want to know what will happen to them. I FEEL TRAPED. THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR ME. IF I LIVE I KNOW I WLL NEVER BE HAPPY WITH MYSELF AND IF I DIE I KNOW MY PARENTS WOULD BE DEVASTATED. I hate myself, i really hate myself. i'm so hopeless and such an idiot, why did i want to choose such a career where i know there is no future for me.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this.

The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."". Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff.
