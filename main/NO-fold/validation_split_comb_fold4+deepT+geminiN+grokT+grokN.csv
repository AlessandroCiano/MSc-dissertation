38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,Attempt,attempt,True

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support.

I can't do anything right I'm so useless, if I keep starving myself I'll at least be dead by the end of the week. I just want my death to come faster",2,behavior,Behavior,behavior,True
445,"Melancholy. Work sleep work sleep work sleep. I just don't want to go on anymore. It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up. I deserve a chance to show everyone exactly how bad I've been hurting, and fuck you if you think I'm selfish. I just need a chance to help myself. I need to be able to feel at least some small happiness again. How do I go on?",2,behavior,behavior,behavior,True

I can't evenbseem to write proper philosophy because. oh I have a license in philosophy but I'm trying for a master and failing miserably. My ideas are just shit coming from my stupid mind thinking it's a genius when it's just delusional. I'm a cunt. My only worth is my pair of tits. Come take my pair of tits. pay me for how much of a whore I am. I'm just a fuck hole, can't even take a spot in the kitchen. I have no value. I'm going to kill myself. Fuck me.

473,"I'm 14 and the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother. For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school. I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,ideation,ideation,True
480,I want to die. I wanna stop hearing my thoughts and feeling this pain. my mind always feels like clutter and I don't know what's wrong with me. I can never get sleep or think straight. yet i've only been diagnosed with depression. I feel like I wasn't supposed to be born. I stick out but not in a good way. I don't know how to undo the mess i've done with my life. I haven't been happy in 2 years now. it just seems like my adulthood is all downhill from here. I don't have any passions or desires i'm not good at anything. I can't even have a normal high schooler job without feeling so much anxiety that I have to quit because I couldn't stop crying. i'm a failure. I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore. i'm only 19 and I feel like i've seen enough of my future to want to continue. someone please help me,1,ideation,ideation,ideation,True
489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,behavior,behavior,True
491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,behavior,behavior,True
492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,indicator,indicator,True
