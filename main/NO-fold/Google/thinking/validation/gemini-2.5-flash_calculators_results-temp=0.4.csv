0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ending my life"", ""go to a bridge and jump off"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Never will find love,"" ""mental breakdown,"" ""everything in my life is crap,"" ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""go to a bridge and jump off"" (specific location and method).
    *   References to past attempts: ""ending my life again"" suggests a recurrence of suicidal thoughts, but doesn't explicitly state a past *attempt* (concrete action). The 'Attempt' definition requires a ""concrete action"" in the past. ""Thinking about ending my life again"" implies past *ideation* rather than a past *action*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""ending my life.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""ending my life,"" ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""go to a bridge and jump off"" is a specific method and location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The mention of a specific location and method (""go to a bridge and jump off"") indicates a concrete plan, which falls under the 'Behavior' definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""ending my life again"" refers to a recurrence of past thoughts/feelings.
    *   ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" refer to *current* intentions and a *current* specific plan. The focus is on present intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a specific plan is present.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because a specific plan/method (""go to a bridge and jump off"") is clearly stated. The 'Ideation' definition explicitly states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because while ""again"" suggests past issues, it doesn't explicitly describe a concrete past *action* (attempt). The phrase ""thinking about ending my life again"" leans towards past *ideation* rather than a past *attempt*. The primary content describes a *current* specific plan. The 'Attempt' definition requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened in the past.

    Based on the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (""go to a bridge and jump off""), the post best fits the 'Behavior' category.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to die soon"" (mentions dying, but not explicitly suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm inconsolable"" (extreme distress, hopelessness).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" indicates a belief or prediction of death, but it does not explicitly state an intention to commit suicide or a desire to end one's own life. It could refer to natural causes, an accident, or self-harm, but the self-harm aspect is not explicit.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly. It's a statement about an anticipated event, not a direct desire for it, although the ""inconsolable"" state implies a desire for an end to suffering.
   - The rule states: ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given the ambiguity, I must lean towards 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm going to die soon"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress (""inconsolable"") and a statement about dying soon.
   - However, it *does not* explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or a clear desire to *commit* suicide.
   - The 'Indicator' definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - Since ""I'm going to die soon"" is a vague mention of death without explicit reference to suicide, and the rules strongly emphasize explicitness for 'ideation' and leaning towards 'indicator' when in doubt, this post fits the 'Indicator' category.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Key elements: ""I hate living"", ""sometime i think about why i have to live until now"".
   - Emotional indicators: Strong negative emotions, hopelessness, existential despair, dissatisfaction with life.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of suicide, dying, or self-harm.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I hate living"" expresses a strong desire not to continue living in the current state or at all. However, according to the 'Indicator' definition, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" The post does not use phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" or ""I want to end my life."" It expresses a general hatred for living and questioning existence, which falls under general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current feelings and ongoing thoughts (""I hate living"", ""sometime i think"").
   - No past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses distress, hopelessness, and a strong dislike for life (""I hate living"").
   - However, it does not contain any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or a desire to not be alive in the direct sense required for 'Ideation' as per the provided definitions. The 'Indicator' definition specifically covers ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" Since ""suicide/killing oneself"" is not explicitly mentioned, and there's no direct statement of wanting to die, it aligns with 'Indicator'.
   - There are no plans, methods, or self-harming behaviors, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions ""kill myself"" directly.
   - Expresses a desire to end life.
   - Mentions specific methods: ""barbiturates/Nembutal"".
   - Shows signs of preparation/planning by asking for help to ""find some trustworthy"" means.
   - Emotional indicators: Desperation, seeking help for a suicidal act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, ""kill myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
   - Yes, ""Help me kill myself"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned: ""barbiturates/Nembutal"".
   - Yes, there are signs of preparation: the request ""Please somebody help me find"" implies active steps to acquire the means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""Help me kill myself"", ""help me find""). It is not a past event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Ideation' because specific methods and a clear request for help in acquiring them (preparation/planning) are present, moving beyond just thoughts.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes current intentions/plans, not a past action.
   - This fits 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""Help me kill myself"") and mentions a specific method (""barbiturates/Nembutal"") along with a clear indication of preparation (seeking help to find/acquire the means).

I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Is there a painless way to die."", ""I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" These are direct expressions related to dying.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm struggling."", ""unmotivated"", ""selfish"", ""worthless"", ""tired"", ""scares me"", ""fear intimacy"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post *asks* about a painless way to die and states ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" This indicates a desire for a method but no specific method or plan is mentioned or implied to be in place.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, by asking ""Is there a painless way to die"" and expressing a desire to ""sleep forever"" and ""die"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Is there a painless way to die"", ""I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The user is *asking* about methods, not stating a specific method they have chosen or are preparing. They explicitly state ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Is there a painless way to die"", ""I want to sleep forever"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is too low as there are explicit mentions of wanting to die.
   - 'Ideation' fits well. There are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but no specific plan is mentioned. The user is seeking a method, not stating one they possess or are preparing.
   - 'Behavior' is too high because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The user explicitly states they *don't know how* to die with certainty and without pain.
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect as there is no mention of a past attempt.

   - Emotional indicators: ""pointless"", ""huge waste of time"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts described. The post refers to past *thinking* (""for a year straight i was constantly thinking"") but not past *actions*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""want to kill myself"", ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""want to die"", ""whats the point of living"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and philosophical questions about life's purpose and the justification for suicide. It mentions a past period of *thinking* about these things, but no past *actions* or *attempts*. The core is current suicidal ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""want to kill myself"", ""want to die"", ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves""). This eliminates 'Indicator'.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or specific actions). This eliminates 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. The mention of ""for a year straight i was constantly thinking"" refers to a period of ideation, not an attempt. This eliminates 'Attempt'.
   - The post clearly fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings without any specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it,"" ""I want it to stop,"" ""I need peace"" (in context of ending pain). While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrases ""want to be gone,"" ""want it to be over,"" and ""don't wanna survive it"" are strong, direct expressions of a desire to end one's life. The phrase ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" could imply a desire for self-harm, but it's not a concrete plan.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""so much mental pain,"" ""I can't handle it,"" ""I hate everything."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" and ""I don't wanna survive it"" are direct and explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': These expressions are not vague; they clearly convey a desire to end existence. They fit the 'Ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no plan or method mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""tonight"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life (""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it""), which aligns with the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" part of the 'Ideation' definition.
    *   It does *not* mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does *not* describe a past attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   It *does* contain explicit expressions of wanting to die/not be alive, which rules out 'Indicator' (as 'Indicator' lacks *any* explicit expression concerning suicide or a desire to die).

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I just wanna die.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""sick of being worthless,"" ""sick of acting like every day was perfect,"" ""sick of feeling pain,"" ""sick of waking up everyday knowing I don't have a purpose,"" ""I'm so sick."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a lack of purpose.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just wanna die."" This is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., tools, locations, notes), which rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""tiring,"" ""tired,"" ""lonely,"" ""ugly and stupid and not good enough"" indicate distress, low self-esteem, and emotional exhaustion.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" is a direct mention.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post explicitly states, ""but I don't actually want to."" This is a crucial point. While the *thought* of suicide is present (intrusive thoughts), the *desire* to act on it is explicitly denied by the poster.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current, ongoing intrusive thoughts (""keeps telling me""). There is no mention of past events or attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit mention of suicide (""kill myself""). This would typically lean towards 'Ideation' or higher.
    *   However, the definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
    *   The user explicitly states ""I don't actually want to,"" which means there is no expressed *desire* to die.
    *   According to the provided rules, specifically the conditional within the 'Ideation' definition, if no desire to die is expressed, the classification should be 'indicator'. This rule overrides the presence of the explicit mention of suicide when the desire is absent or denied. The post describes intrusive thoughts and general distress, but not a personal desire to end one's life.

   - Are there signs of preparation? While not explicitly stating acquisition, the mention of ""either I run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids"" indicates consideration of specific means/methods. The definition of 'behavior' includes ""a specific method or preparations taken"". The methods are specific enough.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""want to call it a day and kill myself"", ""want to die now, right now"", ""either I run towards a cop... or find a dealer..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"", ""want to die now""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - The post goes beyond just thoughts by mentioning specific methods (""run towards a cop with a knife"", ""find a dealer with some opioids""). This fits the definition of 'behavior' which requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method"".
   - There is no description of a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrases ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last"" strongly indicate a desire to end their life and contemplation of the act.
   - Emotional indicators: ""It's not working anymore,"" ""deteriorating,"" ""haven't slept in weeks,"" ""all I see and think are people are going to hurt me,"" ""can't tell anyone,"" ""refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will."" These show severe distress, hopelessness, paranoia, and a feeling of being trapped.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just want to get it over with"" and the fear of pain ""if I go through with it"" clearly express a desire to end their life. This falls under ""stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life"" as per the 'Ideation' definition.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no explicit plan or method is mentioned, it does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (""I just want to get it over with,"" ""if I go through with it"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'indicator' because there are clear, albeit indirect, expressions of a desire to end their life (""get it over with,"" ""go through with it"" with fear of pain from the act). This goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
   - It's not 'behavior' because no specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
   - It's not 'attempt' because no past attempt is described.
   - The post expresses a clear desire to end their life (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"") but without a specific plan, which perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I'd leave myself if I could"". This is a metaphorical expression of wanting to escape one's own being or circumstances, but it does not explicitly mention suicide, dying, or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Such a fucked up way to feel"", ""it starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts."" These indicate significant emotional distress, pain, and a sense of resignation or hopelessness regarding interpersonal relationships.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is metaphorical and does not use direct terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" or ""end my life.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" expresses a desire to escape oneself or one's situation, but it is not a direct statement of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** Given the lack of explicit suicidal language and the metaphorical nature of the closest phrase, the instruction to lean towards 'indicator' applies.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** Not applicable, as there is no mention of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and ongoing patterns (""I always think to myself"", ""I start reflecting"", ""it still hurts""). There is no mention of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant emotional distress, loneliness, and a sense of hopelessness about relationships. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" suggests a deep desire to escape one's current state or self. However, according to the definitions, for a post to be classified as 'ideation', it must include *explicit* expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive. The current phrasing is metaphorical and does not meet this explicit requirement. The definition for 'indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits the 'indicator' definition perfectly due to the lack of explicit suicidal language and the presence of general distress and hopelessness.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""i plan to kill myself at 21"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""i am not ok,"" ""severely codependent,"" ""constant anxiety, self doubt, and mistrust,"" ""no hope,"" ""this is hell."" These indicate severe distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i plan to kill myself at 21"". This is a specific plan with a defined timeframe (age 21). While it doesn't mention a *method*, it clearly states a *plan*.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i plan to kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""i plan to kill myself"" directly expresses this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., how to do it) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned.
   - However, a specific *plan* is mentioned: ""i plan to kill myself at 21"". The definition of 'Behavior' states ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". A timeframe for a future action constitutes a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a future intention: ""i plan to kill myself at 21, whether i want to or not, i'm 18 now.""
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a plan is stated.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post contains a specific plan (""i plan to kill myself at 21""), which goes beyond just suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive without a plan. The definition of Ideation explicitly states ""without any specific plan"".
   - 'Behavior' fits because the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""i plan to kill myself"") and mentions a specific plan to commit suicide (""at 21""). Even though a method isn't specified, the timeframe constitutes a plan.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as the post describes a future plan, not a past action.

Based on the explicit statement ""i plan to kill myself at 21"", this falls under 'Behavior' as it constitutes a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die."" ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon."" ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't like anything about myself,"" ""I also hate my job and my family,"" ""I haven't spoken to anyone in months,"" ""Nobody is getting anything out of this,"" ""sick and tried of crying myself to sleep every night."" (Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, isolation, self-loathing).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The statement ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"" directly contradicts the presence of an immediate plan or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I want to die,"" ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence"") with a stated delay for future action (""given myself 5 more years""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die,"" ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The post explicitly states ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"" and does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation. This means it does not fit the definition of 'Behavior' (which requires a plan or self-harming behavior).
   - The post does not describe any past suicide attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The desire to not be alive is present, but a concrete plan is explicitly absent.

I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I feel like the only way out is suicide."" ""I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it."" ""I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of distress, hopelessness, despair, feeling trapped, overwhelmed, low self-worth, anxiety, emptiness, social isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I've considered hanging"" is a specific method. However, the explicit negation ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" and ""I don't have the guts"" indicates a lack of immediate intent or preparation to act on this consideration.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I feel like the only way out is suicide.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I feel like the only way out is suicide,"" ""I think I should just make my escape.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging"" is mentioned as something considered.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. Crucially, the post states ""I can't seem to go through with it"" and ""I don't have the guts,"" which indicates a *lack* of preparation or immediate intent to execute the considered method. This is a thought/consideration, not an active plan.
    *   The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" is relevant here, as the mention of a method is immediately negated by the inability to act on it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and ongoing struggles. The suicidal thoughts are present. ""I've considered hanging"" refers to a past consideration, but the current state is an inability to act on it. No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""only way out is suicide,"" ""make my escape"").
    *   A specific method (""hanging"") is mentioned, but it is explicitly stated that the person ""can't seem to go through with it"" and ""don't have the guts."" This means there is no *specific plan* being acted upon or prepared for. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior"" and ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The post lacks this crucial element of an *active plan* or *preparations*.
    *   Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicidal notes"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"" indicates strong despair and a desire to end current suffering.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" is a clear sign of preparation. ""just a matter of when and how"" indicates active consideration of methods and timing.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i already know i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it"", ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific method (like a tool or location), but ""suicidal notes ready"" is a concrete sign of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""suicidal notes ready"". This directly matches an example given in the 'Behavior' definition (""e.g. suicide note"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current decision and future intentions (""i'm going to kill myself"", ""just a matter of when and how"", ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to end life, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by mentioning a concrete preparation: ""suicidal notes ready"". The 'Behavior' definition states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". This directly aligns with the post.
   - The post does not describe a past action, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The desire is to ""be someone else"", which is a desire for a different existence or identity, not a desire to cease existing.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and desires (""I just wish I could press a button and be someone else"", ""I just want to be someone else"").
   - Past attempts are not described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses profound distress, self-hatred, and a desire for escape or transformation (""be someone else"").
   - However, it *does not* contain any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The desire to ""be someone else"" is not equivalent to suicidal ideation as defined.
   - According to the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide.

Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post discusses people who post about ""going to kill themselves"" or ""are in the process of doing so."" It questions their motivations, suggesting they are ""looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to the general behavior of others who might post about suicide, not the author's past attempts or current/future intentions.

In this post, the author is discussing the topic of suicide and the motivations of others who post about it. They are not expressing any personal suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts. Therefore, despite the explicit mention of ""kill themselves"" in the context of others, the author's own state, as reflected in the post, lacks any indication of personal suicide risk.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (""the past two times ive tried ive failed"").
    *   The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While the post doesn't mention a specific *current plan* (method/location), it clearly expresses *current suicidal ideation* (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself,"" ""Im so tired of being alive""). The primary criterion for 'Attempt' is met by the clear mention of past attempts. The presence of current ideation alongside past attempts reinforces this classification as per the note in the definition.

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The statement ""I can't live without estrogen"" expresses a severe difficulty or inability to cope if a specific condition (access to estrogen) is not met, but it does not explicitly state a desire to die or not be alive. It describes a condition for living, not a desire to end life.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.** It is clear that suicide is not explicitly mentioned, nor is a direct desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current intense emotional distress and worries about future health issues and parental reactions. There is no mention of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys high levels of distress, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed (""too much"", ""going insane"", ""so fucking scared"").
    *   However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, specific plans, methods, or past attempts.
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   The post fits this definition as it expresses significant distress and hopelessness without crossing the threshold into explicit suicidal ideation.

22,There is NO hope left. I've been on medication after medication. I've done biofeedback. I went to therapy twice a week for 4 years. I did EMDR. I had 27 sessions of TMS that did NOTHING. There is no way I can afford Ketamine. I live on $786 a month and some days don't even eat. So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more. Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Now it's time to end it."" This is a clear expression of intent to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""NO hope left,"" ""don't even eat,"" ""did NOTHING"" (referring to treatments failing). Shows extreme hopelessness, despair, and distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method or preparation is mentioned for the *current* intention.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" This explicitly describes multiple past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""Now it's time to end it"" is a direct and explicit expression of wanting to end one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Now it's time to end it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': For the *current* intention, there's no specific plan, which would lean towards ideation if not for other factors.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both: ""So I tried... And I tried some more"" refers to past attempts. ""Now it's time to end it"" refers to a current/future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes *past attempts* at suicide (""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more.""). This aligns directly with the ""Attempt"" definition: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide.""
    *   The ""Attempt"" definition also explicitly states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The phrase ""Now it's time to end it"" signifies a current plan or intention.
    *   Therefore, the combination of clear past attempts and a current intention to end life places this squarely in the 'Attempt' category.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" refers to current and ongoing suicidal thoughts. There is no description of a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The post describes thoughts, not actions or plans for action.
   - Not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I've given up in life"", ""I'm not scared to die"", ""life may end up getting better but for me it doesn't"" (implying an end for the author), ""Good luck to the rest of you"" (farewell).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""What's the use"", ""given up in life"", ""torment my family"" (implies feeling like a burden), hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" This explicitly states the existence of a plan, a suicide note, and a specific date.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm not scared to die"" combined with ""I have a plan, note and date"" strongly indicates a desire to end life. ""I've given up in life"" and ""life may end up getting better but for me it doesn't"" also contribute to this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have a plan, note and date"". The mention of a ""note"" and a ""date"" clearly indicates preparations. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""which will be in early April"" refers to a future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die/not be alive and a clear plan/preparations.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post goes beyond just thoughts and explicitly mentions ""a plan, note and date"". The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While the *specific method* isn't detailed, the *existence* of a plan and preparations (note, date) moves it into Behavior.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm not scared to die"", ""given up in life"") and explicitly mentions a plan and preparations (""I have a plan, note and date""). The mention of a ""note"" is a direct example given in the Behavior definition for ""preparations taken"".

That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself"" (repeatedly), ""end up dead in a gutter."" Also, ""how many cuts I have all over myself"" indicates self-harm. ""This will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" implies an end to life/communication.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""hopefully forever"" in an institution, ""no family anyway so no one would care or miss me""), despair, extreme anger (""my anger is worse than ever,"" ""rabid dog,"" ""ready to explode"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions a plan to go to a hospital and check into a mental health institution as an *alternative* to suicide. It states, ""So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself."" However, for the act of suicide itself, no specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned. The user explicitly states, ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet,"" which indicates a lack of concrete planning or preparation for suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The user mentions ""how many cuts I have all over myself,"" which is self-harm. However, it is not described as a past *suicide attempt* (i.e., an action taken with the intent to end life). The definition of 'attempt' specifies ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The cuts are not described in this manner.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""or I actually do go through with it and kill myself.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for suicide is mentioned. The ""plan"" discussed is for seeking help or a general consideration of killing oneself, not a concrete method for the act of suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The user explicitly states, ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current overwhelming suicidal thoughts (""The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently"") and future intentions (""I plan on going to a hospital,"" ""or I actually do go through with it and kill myself"").
    *   Past attempts are not specifically described. The cuts are past self-harm, not a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits well. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""kill myself""). Crucially, it is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The user is still ""debating"" and ""haven't even left home yet,"" indicating no concrete plan or action taken towards suicide.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"" for suicide. The self-harm (cuts) is mentioned as an existing condition, not as part of a current suicide plan. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the post does not describe a past suicide attempt. The cuts are described as self-harm, not an attempt to end life.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks a specific plan or preparations for suicide.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Im so tired"", ""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point"", ""i just can't commit to it"", ""they insist that they care but i dont believe it"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a sense of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"". This explicitly mentions a specific method (jumping from a cliff) and a specific location, along with an assessment of its feasibility.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I can't kill myself"", ""I told someone that im suicidal"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Im so tired i can't kill myself"" implies a desire to end life, and ""there's no me at this point"" indicates a profound sense of non-existence or desire to cease existing.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a good clif"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The user knows a specific location (""a good clif"") and has considered the distance and feasibility (""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there""). This constitutes mentioning a specific plan, even if they state they ""can't commit to it"". The definition for 'Behavior' states ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions/struggle (""I can't kill myself"", ""I know a good clif"", ""i just can't commit to it""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal"", ""I can't kill myself"").
    *   It also mentions a specific method and location (""a good clif"", ""its possible to get there""). This goes beyond mere ideation into the realm of a specific plan, even if the individual is struggling with the commitment to execute it. The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide...

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrases ""I just want it all to stop"" and ""I wish I was never born"" express a strong desire for the current suffering to end and a wish for non-existence. However, the definition for 'Indicator' explicitly states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Since ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or ""kill myself"" are not explicitly used, even with the strong expressions of despair, it leans towards 'indicator' based on the strict rule.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and a desire for the current state of suffering to cease. There are no references to past attempts or concrete future plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly conveys extreme distress, hopelessness, and a desire for an end to suffering. However, it *does not explicitly use the words ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or ""kill myself.""* The rules for 'Indicator' are very strict on the requirement for explicit mention of suicide to move to 'Ideation'. Phrases like ""I just want it all to stop"" and ""I wish I was never born"" imply a desire for non-existence but are not as explicit as ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" Therefore, following the strict definition and the ""when in doubt"" rule, it falls into 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"", ""better off if I did it"") and mentions a specific method (""blade"") along with a clear indication of ""preparations taken"" (""I hold the blade""). The struggle (""can't fucking do it"") doesn't negate the fact that the means are present and being held with suicidal intent, which is a behavioral manifestation. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior.

People love plastic, and people love plastic people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"" explicitly mentions dying.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Life's not about being yourself and being unique, it's about catering to the interests of others and stripping yourself of individuality and playing within their comfort zone."" ""Seems my family doesn't like a depressed 16 year old, but doesn't even deal with him."" These indicate feelings of hopelessness, despair, lack of acceptance, and a sense of being a burden.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""how about i die then"" is a direct expression.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""how about i die then"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current/future intention (""how about i die then"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die (""how about i die then"").
   - It does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - It does not describe a past suicide attempt.
   - Based on the definitions, ""Ideation"" fits best: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself will happen"", ""taking my own life"", ""will not live to see my 40th birthday"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""no hope"", ""all is lost"", ""pointless"", ""meaningless"", ""waste of energy"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life"" and ""It is my daily reminder that killing myself will happen."" This indicates a strong decision and intent, and a mental preparation (the wallpaper as a reminder). However, no specific method (e.g., type of weapon, substance, location) or concrete preparation for a method is mentioned. The timeframe ""will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)"" is a general deadline, not a specific time or plan.
   - References to past attempts: ""At least I DID try."" This is vague and, in context (""It is pointless, meaningless, and a waste of energy to even keep trying""), likely refers to trying to live or cope, not a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing myself will happen"", ""taking my own life"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""will not live to see my 40th birthday"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The ""computer wallpaper"" serves as a reminder and reinforces the decision, but it is not a preparation for a specific method (e.g., acquiring a weapon, writing a note for a specific act). The statement ""100% confirmed"" expresses a firm decision and intent, but not a *plan* with details on *how*.
   - As per the rule: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" There is no explicit plan here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""will happen"", ""will be taking"", ""will not live to see"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No. ""At least I DID try"" is too vague to be a concrete past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to end one's life.
   - It lacks any specific plan (method, location, specific time beyond a general future date) or concrete preparations for a specific method.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is mentioned multiple times (""perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago"", ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I'm so so tired"", ""My mind, my soul, my heart"", ""tired of being criticized and unloved"", ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here."" These indicate deep despair, hopelessness, and regret.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The ""perfect opportunity"" refers to a past, unacted-upon scenario, not a current plan.
    *   References to past attempts: The post states, ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down."" This explicitly indicates that a past *opportunity* existed and the person *wanted* to act, but ultimately *did not* commit suicide. It is not a description of a past *attempt* (a concrete action).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post describes a strong desire to die and regret over not having died in the past, but no *current* specific plan or method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to past events: ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down."" This describes a past *desire/opportunity* that was *not* acted upon.
    *   Refers to current/future intentions: ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself."" This indicates ongoing, strong suicidal ideation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"") and regret not having done so in the past. However, it lacks any specific *current* plan or method. This fits the definition of Ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a *current* specific plan (method, location, means) or preparations. The past ""opportunity"" was not acted upon.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the post explicitly states the person *did not* act on the past opportunity (""I was a pussy"", ""shouldn't have talked myself down""). The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened in the past, which is explicitly negated here.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without a specific current plan, and explicitly states a past opportunity was not acted upon.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""too weak"", ""hurt me severely"", ""embarrassing myself"", ""showing how weak I am"", ""pathetic"", ""shitty he's being"", ""used by everyone I know"". These indicate significant distress, self-deprecation, and feelings of helplessness in a social context.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on relational distress and feelings of inadequacy in that context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current and ongoing relational issues and the user's feelings about them. There are no references to past suicide attempts or future suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses distress, sadness, and hopelessness related to a social situation (""I'm too weak"", ""I'm pathetic"", ""I'll just forgive him and continue to be used"").
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or any suicidal thoughts. The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post perfectly fits this description. It is a clear expression of distress and hopelessness without any suicidal ideation or planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working"" (explicitly metaphorical). ""I just want to not exist."" (strong desire to cease to be).
   - Emotional indicators: ""hollow,"" ""sadness,"" ""hate this,"" ""hurts so bad,"" ""I hate myself,"" ""suffer in silence."" These indicate high levels of distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No direct mention of ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"" (the one instance was metaphorical).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to not exist."" This is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes current feelings and a current desire (""I just want to not exist""). There are no descriptions of past events related to suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to not be alive (""I just want to not exist""), which fits the definition of 'ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"").
   - It does not mention any specific plan or method, ruling out 'behavior'.
   - It does not describe any past attempts, ruling out 'attempt'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""I just want to end it"", ""I just want to put a bullet..."").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I just want to die"", ""take my own life"").
   - Crucially, it also mentions a specific method: ""put a bullet right through it"". This moves it beyond mere ideation into the 'Behavior' category, as it describes a specific way to commit suicide. It does not describe a past attempt.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author mentions past ""stress, anxiety, and depression"" but clarifies, ""Fortunately, I am in a good place now.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** For the author, a past ""plan"" is mentioned in the context of the 2009 attempt (""I faltered in my plan""), but no details of the method are given, and no *current* plans are present for the author.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" This is a direct and clear reference to a past suicide attempt by the author.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times regarding the author's past experiences (""suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" ""commit suicide,"" ""attempt"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not *currently* for the author. The author explicitly states they are ""in a good place now"" and haven't had suicidal ideation in months.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The core rule for classification is that the risk corresponds *only* to the person writing the post.
    *   The post clearly and explicitly describes a past suicide attempt by the author (""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded"").
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans."" This perfectly matches the author's statement.
    *   Even though the author is currently in a good place, the explicit mention of a past concrete attempt classifies it as 'Attempt' according to the definition.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" is a clear, albeit coded, reference to suicide. ""Sewer slide"" is a widely recognized euphemism for suicide on social media. The user also states, ""And it's tempting a lot of the time,"" directly linking the temptation to these suicidal thoughts.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""scared therapy wont work,"" ""worry therapy won't work,"" ""tired of always being afraid and upset,"" ""tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation,"" ""live every moment in shame."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and self-deprecating thoughts.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the euphemism ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts."" This is a direct, albeit coded, reference to suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the ""kermit sewer slide"" thoughts being ""tempting a lot of the time"" strongly implies a desire to not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The mention is sufficiently explicit via the common euphemism, so it's not unclear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan or preparation mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" and ""it's tempting a lot of the time"" refer to current and ongoing suicidal ideation.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kermit sewer slide"" thoughts and the temptation associated with them).
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.
    *   There is no description of a past attempt.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward and don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I hate being alive"", ""God I wish I was never born"", ""makes me want to kill myself"", ""I want to kill myself so badly"", ""people who want to die"", ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train"", ""if I did kill myself"", ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"", ""end of life stuff"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I hate myself so much"", ""terrible"", ""awful"", ""disgusting and pathetic"", ""sad and stupid"", ""hate everything"", ""humiliates me so deeply"", ""fucked in the head"", ""want to crawl out of my skin"". These show extreme hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train"" explicitly mentions a method (jumping) and a location (train). ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" indicates consideration of practical preparations, even if they are a barrier.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times: ""makes me want to kill myself"", ""I want to kill myself so badly"", ""if I did kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes: ""I hate being alive"", ""God I wish I was never born"", ""people who want to die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump in front of a train"" is a specific method and location.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the mention of ""end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" shows consideration of preparations, even if they are a current obstacle. The phrase ""It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward and don't know how to deal with end of life stuff"" indicates the plan is being seriously considered.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""I want to kill myself"", ""I wish I had the guts"", ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and location, which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' (""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations (e.g. ...train lines to get run over by)"").
   - The hesitation about ""end of life stuff"" and asking for someone to ""push me to go thru with it"" does not negate the presence of a specific, considered plan.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I want to kill myself"".

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself"", ""everyone would be better off with me dead"") but does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation. It also does not refer to a past attempt. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

42,"confinement mental break down. i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it. i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method of self-harm/suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""confinement mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" ""feeling more alone.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i thought about slitting my wrists today"" indicates a specific method was considered. ""but i didnt do it"" explicitly states no action was taken or preparation made.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempt is described; it's a past *thought* about an action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Not the word ""suicide,"" but ""slitting my wrists"" is a direct and explicit mention of a method associated with ending one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The thought of ""slitting my wrists"" implies a desire to end suffering or life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slitting my wrists.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post explicitly states ""but i didnt do it,"" indicating no preparation or action was taken. It was a thought.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Here, it's clearly a thought, not a plan being executed or prepared for.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""thought about slitting my wrists today"" refers to a recent thought. ""growing more depressed and feeling more alone"" refers to current feelings.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, it's a past *thought* about an action, not a past *action*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'Indicator' because there's an explicit mention of a suicide method (""slitting my wrists""), going beyond general distress.
   - It's not 'Behavior' because no plan was acted upon or prepared for; it was explicitly stated as a thought (""but i didnt do it"").
   - It's not 'Attempt' because no concrete action happened in the past; it was a thought, not an attempt.
   - It fits 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The thought of ""slitting my wrists"" is an explicit suicidal thought, and the phrase ""but i didnt do it"" confirms no plan was executed or prepared.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""the suicidal feelings are coming back.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal feelings.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression of wanting to die, but ""suicidal feelings"" clearly indicates suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" refers to current feelings that are resurfacing. It's about current suicidal thoughts, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal feelings,"" which indicates suicidal thoughts. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

   - There is no mention of a past attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The explicit mention of wanting to die rules out 'Indicator', which requires the post to lack any explicit expression concerning suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters."" It states ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""My minds made up,"" which are strong indicators of imminent suicidal intent. The user is seeking help with a specific preparation for suicide (writing notes).
2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:** Yes, ""suicide notes"" is an explicit mention. ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""My minds made up"" are direct expressions of wanting to die/end life.
3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:** While a specific *method* of dying isn't mentioned, the act of asking how to write ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"" is a clear sign of *preparation* for suicide. The 'Behavior' definition explicitly includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"".
4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:** The post refers to current and future intentions (""I'm leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up,"" ""I just need help on the goodbye letters""). There is no mention of past attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly mentions ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" (past suicide attempts), ""suicide date"" (future suicide), ""doubt ill make it that long"" (desire to die soon), ""I'm fucking done"" (hopelessness/giving up), ""only reason I didn't die last night"" (recent suicidal ideation/intent), ""end thing v v soon"" (future intent to die), ""save some flowers for me please?"" (farewell/preparatory language), ""struggle with sh/suicidality"" (mentions self-harm and suicidality).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worst of this hell,"" ""enough is enough,"" ""don't trust anymore,"" ""TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul,"" ""trauma/ptsd,"" ""fucking done,"" ""treat me like shit."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and distrust.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific date is given: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it."" This is a concrete plan regarding timing. ""save some flowers for me please?"" suggests a farewell or preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""8 yrs of constant attempts but obv I wasn't trying hard enough."" This is a direct and explicit mention of multiple past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (""suicide date,"" ""suicidality,"" ""attempts"").
    *   There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""doubt ill make it that long,"" ""I'm fucking done,"" ""end thing v v soon,"" ""only reason I didn't die last night"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific *method* (e.g., specific tool, substance) is mentioned.
    *   However, a specific *date* is set for suicide, which constitutes explicit planning (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date""). The phrase ""save some flowers for me please?"" also suggests a form of preparation or farewell.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to both past events (""8 yrs of constant attempts,"" ""only reason I didn't die last night"") and very strong current/future intentions (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon"").
    *   Past attempts are specifically described: ""8 yrs of constant attempts.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes past suicide attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts""). This aligns with the 'Attempt' definition.
    *   The post also includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (setting a ""suicide date""), which aligns with 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the 'Attempt' definition has a crucial rule: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   Since this post explicitly mentions ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" (past attempts) AND ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"" (current plan), the specific rule dictates that the classification should be 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

        *   ""until in my grave I lay"" - general reference to death.
        *   ""I want to disappear forever"" - strong desire for non-existence/death.
        *   ""I know I will die by 35."" - a statement about their own death, framed as a certainty.
        *   ""What's difficult is the pain caused to people I care about and who care about me, but I don't really think it'll matter one way or the other. They'll suffer and that will be that..."" - discusses the impact of their death on others, indicating contemplation of their own demise.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Pointlessness"", ""sick of everybody's fascination"", ""sick of appearances"", ""distresses me"", ""pain"". These indicate deep despair, nihilism, and a desire to escape existence.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I want to disappear forever"" is a direct and explicit expression of wanting to cease to exist, which is a desire to not be alive. ""I know I will die by 35"" also points to a fixed belief about their own death, possibly self-induced given the context of wanting to disappear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and future intentions/predictions (""I want to disappear forever"", ""I know I will die by 35"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die/not be alive (""I want to disappear forever"", ""I know I will die by 35""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe any past attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress and includes direct expressions of a desire for non-existence, meaning it's not merely an 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"", ""hanging myself"", ""die"", ""not die"", and ""trying to die"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Shits difficult"" indicates frustration and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post discusses ""hanging myself"" and ""taking these pills"" as potential methods. It also considers the efficacy and potential negative outcomes (""break the shower or the door frame"", ""make me sick but not die"", ""end up brain damaged""). This shows active consideration of *how* to commit suicide.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill yourself"", ""hanging myself"").
    *   There are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I'm trying to die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Specific methods are mentioned: ""hanging myself"" and ""taking these pills"". While there is doubt about their effectiveness, these are concrete methods being considered and discussed in the context of ending one's life. This goes beyond a general desire to die and delves into the practicalities of *how* to do it. The user is exploring options for a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current/future intentions and considerations (""idk if hanging myself would even work"", ""I'm trying to die""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide and a desire to die are explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past attempts are described.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. 'Behavior' includes explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan or specific method. This post clearly mentions specific methods (""hanging myself"", ""taking these pills"") even if the user expresses uncertainty about their success. The discussion of *how* to die, including specific means and their potential outcomes, constitutes mentioning a plan, even if it's not a finalized, foolproof one. The user is actively contemplating and discussing specific ways to end their life, which fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""take them all"" in the context of ""pills"" strongly implies an overdose, which is a method of suicide. The speaker wonders why they ""didn't take them all,"" indicating a past consideration of a suicidal act.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?"" indicates severe hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""count my pills"" suggests having access to a potential means (pills) and engaging in a recurring action related to them. ""Take them all"" is a specific method (overdose).
    *   References to past attempts: ""why i didnt take them all"" refers to a past *non-action* or a missed opportunity to commit suicide, not a past attempt that occurred.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" directly implies a desire to have died by taking the pills. The self-criticism (""coward"") for not doing so reinforces this desire.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""take them all"" in reference to ""pills"" is a specific method (overdose).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""every night i count my pills"" can be interpreted as a recurring engagement with the means, a ritualistic preparation, or a contemplation of the act. This aligns with signs of preparation or engagement with a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""every night i count my pills"" and ""every day i wonder why i didnt take them all"" refer to ongoing, current thoughts and a past *non-action* related to a suicidal impulse. It is not describing a past completed attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Not an indicator, as there's a clear implied desire to die and a specific method mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** Not just ideation, because a specific method (""take them all"" of ""pills"") is mentioned, and there's an ongoing engagement with the means (""count my pills"").
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to have taken the pills) and mentions a specific plan/method (""take them all"" of ""pills""). The ""counting pills"" can be seen as a form of preparation or engagement with the means.
    *   **Attempt:** Not an attempt, as the post explicitly states ""why i didnt take them all,"" indicating a past action *did not* occur.

Based on the analysis, the post describes explicit suicidal thoughts along with a specific method and ongoing engagement with the means, fitting the 'Behavior' definition.

Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me. I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again. I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""unbearably strong,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""struggle,"" ""don't know what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and difficulty coping.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: ""don't want to end up in the psych ward again."" This suggests a past mental health crisis that led to hospitalization, but it does not explicitly state a past *suicide attempt* or a ""concrete action"" of an attempt. It's about avoiding a consequence (psych ward).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post describes a ""downward spiral"" and a ""struggle to make it through the day,"" which are severe distress, but not direct expressions of wanting to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die, this leans strongly towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately,"" ""in the past few months my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral,"" ""Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle."" This refers to current and recent ongoing distress.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The mention of ""psych ward again"" refers to a past hospitalization, but not a concrete suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a ""downward spiral."" However, it *lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide* or a direct desire to not be alive.
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   This post perfectly fits the 'Indicator' definition because it shows general distress and hopelessness without explicitly mentioning suicide or a desire to die. The rule to lean towards 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mention of suicide is key here.
    *   It does not meet 'Ideation' because there's no explicit desire to not be alive.
    *   It does not meet 'Behavior' because there's no plan.
    *   It does not meet 'Attempt' because there's no description of a concrete past suicide action. The ""psych ward"" mention is about a past consequence, not a past attempt.

   - Emotional indicators: ""I cant. I absolutely cannot fight anymore."", ""non stop pain and suffering."", ""Please."" - indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide note"".

   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere thoughts by specifying a time (""next week""), a method (""with drugs""), and a preparatory action (""write a suicide note""). This indicates a plan, which moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
   - It describes a future plan, not a past action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts with a mentioned plan and preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post does not explicitly use the words ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""dying."" However, the phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" strongly implies a desire to end one's life or current state of suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""always tired,"" ""so tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""tired of being sick,"" ""lonely,"" ""jealous."" These indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""pills"" is in the context of medication for illness not working, not as a means for self-harm.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" is a very strong, albeit indirect, expression of wanting to end one's life or existence. It conveys a clear desire for an end to the current suffering, which in this context, implies an end to life. This is more than a ""vague feeling about dying or death"" and goes beyond ""general dissatisfaction."" It aligns with ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" as described in the 'Ideation' definition. While the word ""suicide"" isn't present, the *meaning* of wanting to end it all is explicit in context.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is not applicable.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I'm ready to get this over with soon"" refers to a current feeling and a potential future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear expression of a desire for an end to life (""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue""), which fits the 'Ideation' definition of ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    *   It does not mention a specific plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death, making it more than an 'Indicator'. The phrase ""get this over with"" in this context is a strong indicator of suicidal ideation, even without using the direct word ""suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I have overdosed"", ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over"", ""it won't kill me, but it'll punish me"". The act of overdosing is a form of self-harm and a common method for suicide attempts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I regret everything"", ""I regret it. I also don't."", ""I'm sorry"". These show distress, ambivalence, and regret.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have overdosed"", ""I took 500mg Zoloft"". This is a specific method and substance, indicating a concrete action.
   - References to past attempts: ""I finally went through."" and ""I have overdosed."" clearly describe a completed action in the past.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The user explicitly states ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" However, the action taken (overdose) is a method commonly associated with suicide attempts, even if the stated intent wasn't death. The key is that a concrete action has occurred.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdosed"", ""took 500mg Zoloft"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act has already been carried out.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I finally went through."", ""I have overdosed."", ""It hasn't been that long, but I'm getting a headache"". All these phrases indicate a past event that has already occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a concrete action (""I have overdosed"") that has already happened. The 'Attempt' definition explicitly states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" Even though the user states ""it won't kill me"" and ""I don't want to die,"" the act of overdosing with a specific substance and dosage, with the intent to ""punish me"" and ""get my suffering over,"" falls under a ""concrete action"" that constitutes an attempt, as per the definition. It is a completed self-harming act.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - ""I'm doing it in the near future."" - Strong implication of ending life.
   - ""I feel so at peace right now, knowing I'm going to."" - Emotional indicator of acceptance regarding the implied action.
   - ""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go. I'm ready."" - ""Ready to go"" is a euphemism for dying/ending life. Spending time with a loved one can be interpreted as a form of preparation or saying goodbyes, but it's not a specific method or plan.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I'm doing it in the near future"" and ""I'm ready to go"" are direct expressions of an intention to end one's life. This goes beyond vague feelings of death or general dissatisfaction. The definition of 'Ideation' includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. There is no mention of tools, locations, or substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Spending time with a loved one could be seen as a form of emotional preparation (saying goodbyes), but it does not constitute a specific *plan* in terms of *how* the act will be carried out (e.g., acquiring means, specific location). The rule states: ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"". There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I'm doing it in the near future"" refers to current/future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of intent to end life (""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go""), which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
   - Fits 'Ideation' because it contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to end life (""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""I'm ready to go"") but lacks any specific plan (method, means, location).
   - Not 'Behavior' because no specific plan or method is mentioned. The ""spending time"" is not a concrete plan or self-harming behavior.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes future intentions, not past actions.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: The post refers to a past *state* of being suicidal (""i was suicidal""), but does not describe a concrete past *attempt* (e.g., an action like an overdose or cutting).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i was suicidal"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not in the present tense. The expression refers to a past state.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post clearly states ""it was 4 yrs ago"", indicating a past event. It's a reflection on how past suicidal ideation was handled.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. It describes a past state of *being suicidal* (having suicidal thoughts/feelings), not a concrete *action* of an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for posts that *lack* any explicit expression concerning suicide. This post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"", so it is not an 'Indicator'.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan or self-harm. Neither is present in the post.
    *   **Attempt:** This category requires a description of a concrete past *action* (e.g., overdose). The post describes a past *state* of being suicidal (ideation), not a concrete action or attempt. The definition explicitly states: ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'.""
    *   **Ideation:** This category is for explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings. While the post refers to a *past* state of being suicidal rather than *current* ideation, it is a direct and explicit mention of having had suicidal thoughts/feelings. Given that it's not an 'Indicator' (due to explicit mention), not 'Behavior' (no plan), and not 'Attempt' (no concrete action), 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category as it directly addresses the presence of suicidal thoughts/feelings, even if in a past context being reflected upon.

   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific tools, locations, or actions taken to prepare). This eliminates 'behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This eliminates 'attempt'.
   - The post perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

63,i should die. Then my family doesn't need to raise trash anymore with their efforts. then they would live a better life. if I keep living on the earth they have to support me for the rest of their lives and never find their peace. I am just rubbish sucking at everything. I hate my family I have no friends I am so sensitive. I don't think it makes any sense that they have to raise me. tho I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything. I still hate that why everyone was born in a rich family at least not that poor like me. I just hate them that if u are not qualified to give at least average life to ur children then why u still give birth to them and suffer from u? fuck,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""i should die"", ""made up my mind to kill myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""trash"", ""rubbish sucking at everything"", ""hate my family"", ""no friends"", ""so sensitive"", ""hate them"", ""suffer from u?"", ""fuck"". These show extreme distress, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""tho I have prepared everything"" is a direct indication of preparations being made. While no specific method is named, the act of preparation itself signifies a plan beyond mere ideation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No. The post mentions ""I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days"" which refers to a past *decision* or *intention*, not a past *action* or *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""i should die"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""i should die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific method is detailed (e.g., ""jump off a bridge,"" ""take pills"").
    *   Yes, there are signs of preparation: ""tho I have prepared everything."" This phrase strongly indicates that concrete steps have been taken towards carrying out a suicide plan. The 'Behavior' definition states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". ""Prepared everything"" falls under ""preparations taken"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""i should die"" indicates a current desire/intention.
    *   ""tho I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything"" refers to a decision made in the past (""a few days ago"") and preparations that have been completed. This implies a current state of readiness for a future action, not a past completed attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond just thoughts or desires by stating ""I have prepared everything,"" which signifies concrete steps or preparations towards a plan. The 'Ideation' definition explicitly states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While no specific *method* is given, ""prepared everything"" implies the *means* or *preparations* are in place.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because the post describes preparations and a past decision, but not a past *action* of attempting suicide. There is no description of an overdose, self-inflicted injury, or other concrete action that has already occurred. The post describes a state of readiness for a future act.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions preparations taken (""prepared everything""), which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' (""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"").

64,"Vanishing once I am asked to leave. Dont know when, but eventually my roommates will be tired of my presence and me to move out. When that happens I will have nothing to look forward to.

Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body. Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol, a canteen, and the clothes on my back. As for my roommates, they're not dumb, they'll be able to put 2 and 2 together. But will most likely be unphased by the realization. I hope they enjoy my stuff, cuz they never seemed to enjoy my company.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post describes a scenario where the user would ""vanish without a trace,"" ""find a secluded spot where no one will find my body,"" and mentions having ""a pistol"" on them ""at the end."" While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the combination of ""vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body,"" and ""pistol"" clearly indicates an intention to end their life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""nothing to look forward to,"" ""unphased by the realization,"" ""never seemed to enjoy my company."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and feelings of worthlessness/unwantedness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, very detailed. ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them, pick a direction, and start walking. No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes. Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body. Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol, a canteen, and the clothes on my back."" This describes a method (pistol), a location (secluded spot), and extensive preparations (emptying bank, leaving belongings, no phone/car, walking).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Not the word ""suicide,"" but the intent to end life is explicitly conveyed through the detailed plan to disappear and die by pistol in a secluded spot.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""So I would want to vanish without a trace"" in the context of ""nothing to look forward to"" and the detailed plan to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear. The intent is very clear through the detailed plan.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a pistol.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them, pick a direction, and start walking. No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes. Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot..."" These are explicit preparations.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no uncertainty; the planning is explicit and detailed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions, contingent on a specific event (""When that happens I will have nothing to look forward to. So I would want to vanish..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are clear expressions of suicidal intent and a detailed plan.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post goes beyond just thoughts/desires and includes a specific plan (method, location, preparations). The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits perfectly. The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (implied by the detailed plan to die) and ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide"" (pistol, secluded spot) and ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" (planning for it). It includes ""explicit planning like a specific method (pistol) or preparations taken (emptying bank, leaving belongings, walking to a secluded spot).""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes future intentions, not a past completed action.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years"" - Direct mention of being suicidal.
        *   ""I know many people will blame themselves when i do do it"" - Implies future suicide.
        *   ""I dont want the existance ive got."" - Expresses a desire not to live.
        *   ""I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone."" - Implies disappearance due to death.
        *   ""I acted out... screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face"" - Mentions past self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""no one cares right now"", ""so disconected"", ""just rotting away""), despair, feeling misunderstood by professionals.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while"" - Part of a plan regarding location.
        *   ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it"" - **Specific location identified.**
        *   ""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police."" - **Specific preparation/method of warning others identified.**
    *   **References to past attempts:**
        *   ""I acted out... screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face"" - This describes past self-harm, but not a past suicide *attempt* (i.e., an action taken with the intent to die that failed). The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" like an overdose.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal for about 10 years"", ""when i do do it"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I dont want the existance ive got."").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post details a specific location (""the woodland"") and a specific preparation (""leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers""). While a specific *tool* is not mentioned as acquired, the *planning* of location and warning notes constitutes ""explicit planning"" and ""preparations taken"" as per the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the decision to leave notes to warn others.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to past events (being suicidal for 10 years, past self-harm).
    *   Refers to current/future intentions: ""when i do do it"", ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes"". The detailed planning is current.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal for about 10 years"", ""I dont want the existance ive got""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, it goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a specific location (""the woodland where i would do it"") and a specific preparation (""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers""). This meets the criteria for 'Behavior' (""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations"").
    *   The past self-harm mentioned is not described as a past suicide attempt, so 'Attempt' is not the primary classification based on the definition provided (which requires a concrete action with intent to die). The current planning is the dominant feature.

I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit.

Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm so sick and tired"", ""I hate my life"", ""This is complete bullshit"", ""I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me."" These indicate strong feelings of despair, hopelessness, and anger.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night I guess"", ""help me stay alive"", ""miss me when I'm gone"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""desperate"", ""hopeless"", ""no one cares"", ""no one to talk to"", ""no one to help me stay alive"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""tonight's the night I guess"" indicates a temporal intention but no specific method or preparation (e.g., specific tool, location, or acquired means).
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""tonight's the night I guess"", ""miss me when I'm gone"", ""no one to help me stay alive"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations (like acquiring means, writing a note, identifying a specific location/tool) are mentioned. ""Tonight's the night"" indicates a time-bound intent but not a concrete plan or preparation as defined for 'Behavior'.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The post lacks the *how* or *what* for a plan, only the *when* and *that*.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""tonight's the night I guess"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to die.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
   - The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to end life (""tonight's the night I guess""). However, it *lacks a specific plan or method* (e.g., ""I'm going to jump off the bridge,"" ""I have the pills ready""). The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". While ""tonight's the night"" is very serious, it doesn't specify the *method* or *preparations*. Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' definition more accurately: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" also guides this decision.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""cutting an artery"" is a specific, highly lethal method of self-harm. The combination with ""oxy"" (oxycodone, a strong painkiller/opioid) suggests an intention to facilitate or ease the act of cutting an artery, which is a method of ending life.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask"" indicates distress and a search for information related to a highly sensitive and dangerous topic.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""oxy"" and ""cutting an artery"" are specific methods. The question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" is a direct inquiry about the practical execution of these specific methods, implying a detailed consideration or preparation for the act.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly stated as ""I want to die."" However, the discussion of specific lethal methods (""oxy and cutting an artery"") and how to perform them (lessen pain) strongly implies a desire to end life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear that the intent is lethal. The methods are specific and deadly.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""oxy"" and ""cutting an artery."" These are concrete, lethal means.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The question about lessening pain during the act of ""cutting an artery"" while using ""oxy"" is a practical consideration for the *execution* of a specific lethal plan. This goes beyond mere thoughts; it's about the mechanics of carrying out the act.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': I am not uncertain. The post explicitly details specific methods and asks a practical question about their combined use, which directly points to planning or detailed consideration of the execution of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The phrasing ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen..."" refers to a potential future action.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post contains explicit mentions of lethal methods, not just general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. The post goes beyond just thoughts or a desire to die. It includes specific methods (""oxy and cutting an artery"") and a practical question about their execution, which falls under ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)"" as per the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post implies suicidal thoughts through the discussion of lethal methods and asks a question directly related to the *execution* of a specific plan involving ""oxy"" and ""cutting an artery."" This constitutes mentioning a plan to commit suicide with specific methods.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past attempt is described.

A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""die,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""commit suicide"" multiple times. However, these mentions are primarily in the context of the *friend's statement* about the poster, and the poster's reaction to this statement. The poster is quoting their friend's words (""she's positive I'm going to kill myself"", ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The poster expresses being ""hurt,"" ""upset,"" ""no idea what to do,"" ""not sitting well with me at all,"" ""view her differently,"" ""can barely speak to her."" These indicate distress, but the distress is clearly stated as being about the friend's hurtful words and the impact on their relationship, not about their own suicidal feelings.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned by the poster.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned by the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, the words ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" are present.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The poster is *not* expressing a desire to die or not be alive. They are discussing a hurtful comment made by a friend *about* them potentially dying by suicide. The poster states, ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" which contradicts an expression of wanting to die. The post is a request for advice on how to handle a difficult social situation.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** It is clear that the poster is not expressing suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. The mentions of suicide are external (from the friend) and the poster's reaction is one of hurt and confusion regarding the friend's behavior, not their own suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The friend's comment happened ""a couple of weeks ago."" The poster's distress and request for advice are current. There are no current or future *suicidal intentions* expressed by the poster.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains the *words* ""suicide"" and ""kill myself,"" but these are attributed to the friend's comments about the poster, not the poster's own suicidal thoughts or feelings.
    *   The poster explicitly states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness"" and is seeking advice on how to handle a social conflict, not expressing a desire to end their life.
    *   According to the 'Ideation' definition, it requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is absent.
    *   According to the 'Indicator' definition, ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This fits, as the distress is about the friend's words, not the poster's own suicidal intent. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" also applies here, as the *poster's own suicidal intent* is not explicitly mentioned, only the *word* suicide in a different context.
    *   There is no plan, method, or past attempt mentioned by the poster.

Therefore, the post falls into 'Indicator' because while the word ""suicide"" is present, it's not an expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings *from the person writing the post*. The post is about the impact of someone else's hurtful words.

71,"please please please help me. please help im at my window right now with scissors, i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out. i dont know what to do- im only a teen, my parents and siblings are asleep. i dont know what to do-",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""jump out"" clearly indicates an intent to end life, which is a form of self-harm leading to death.
   - Emotional indicators: ""please please please help me,"" ""i feel like im about to,"" ""i dont know what to do-"" show extreme distress, urgency, and a cry for help.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""at my window right now with scissors, i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out."" This specifies a location (window), a method (jumping), and a tool/preparation (scissors to cut the screen).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""jump out"" is a direct expression of an action intended to end life.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear. ""Jump out"" is a direct and explicit action leading to death, making it more than just vague ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump out"" from ""my window.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""with scissors"" to ""cut the screen"" indicates active preparation for the act.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no uncertainty. A specific method (jumping from a window) and a clear preparatory action (using scissors to cut the screen) are explicitly stated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""im at my window right now,"" ""i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out"" indicates immediate current and future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - This post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) and beyond just suicidal thoughts without a plan (Ideation).
   - It clearly describes explicit suicidal thoughts (""jump out"") and includes a specific plan (jumping from the window) along with a preparatory action (using scissors to cut the screen). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.
   - It does not describe a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

72,i'm gonna overdose on iron pills. i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it. i'm sorry,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""gonna overdose"" clearly indicates self-harm with lethal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""pain everyday"", ""don't wanna deal with it"" show despair and hopelessness. ""i'm sorry"" suggests a finality or apology for an impending action.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""overdose on iron pills"" is a specific method using a specific substance.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""overdose on iron pills"" in this context is a direct expression of an intent to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i don't wanna deal with it"" combined with the overdose statement implies a desire to end suffering by ending life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose on iron pills"" is a specific method involving a specific substance.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""i'm gonna overdose"" indicates an immediate or near-future intent to execute this specific plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""i'm gonna overdose"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""don't wanna deal with it"", intent to overdose).
   - It also clearly mentions a specific plan/method: ""overdose on iron pills"".
   - This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs)"".
   - It is not 'Ideation' because a specific plan is mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' because it describes a future action, not a past one. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned with a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""im going to kill myself one day"", ""might as well die"", ""just want to disappear"", ""run away to a forest and fucking die"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""hate it!"", ""feel like a failure"", ""despair"", ""hopelessness"" (due to deferred dream school, abusive parents, lack of friends/money/license).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" mentions a location and a general outcome, but lacks specific details on *how* to die there (e.g., specific method, tools, or preparations). It's more of a desperate wish to escape and die than a concrete plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""im going to kill myself one day"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""might as well die"", ""just want to disappear"", ""run away to a forest and fucking die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? A location (""forest"") and a general outcome (""die"") are mentioned, but not a specific *method* or *means* (e.g., what tool, what action, what substance). The phrase ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" is more of a desperate fantasy of escape and death than a concrete, actionable plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". While ""forest"" is a location, the lack of a specific *how* or *means* within that location, and no signs of preparation, makes it fall short of the 'Behavior' criteria. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - ""im going to kill myself one day"" refers to a future, non-immediate intention.
   - ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" expresses a current, desperate desire.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide/dying is explicitly mentioned multiple times.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past attempts are described.
   - The post clearly expresses ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" which fits the 'Ideation' definition.
   - While a location (""forest"") is mentioned in conjunction with dying, the lack of a specific method, means, or preparations means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The statement ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" is a strong expression of suicidal desire and a fantasy of escape and death, but it doesn't constitute a concrete plan as defined for 'Behavior'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

They express a desire for *external* means of death (being murdered, assisted suicide). While they mention walking through ""sketchy areas"" hoping to be murdered, this is framed as a passive wish for an external event, not an active plan or preparation for *self-inflicted* harm or suicide. There are no mentions of acquiring means, specific locations for their own action, or notes.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

However, it contains phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" and ""im starting to want to wave the white flag."" These strongly imply a desire to cease existing or give up on life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of distress are evident: ""tired of only feeling sadness and anxiety,"" ""tired of the depression and anxiety,"" ""tired of being a burden,"" ""soul is hurting,"" ""tired of getting hurt and blaming myself."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and emotional exhaustion.

""I'm starting to want to wave the white flag"" is a strong metaphor for giving up on life. These go beyond general dissatisfaction and indicate a desire to not be alive any longer.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expressions are sufficiently direct to indicate a desire to not be alive, fitting the 'ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states, ""I really, really wish lives were donate-able,"" implying a desire to give up one's life. It explicitly says, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" and ""I just wish I could donate my life"". It also mentions the author ""was suicidal like me some time ago,"" referring to their own past state.

   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""was suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to the author's past *state of being suicidal* (i.e., past ideation), not a concrete past *attempt* (e.g., an overdose or specific action). The definition of 'attempt' requires a ""concrete action"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used by the author about themselves in the present. However, there are direct and explicit expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: ""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" and the repeated wish to ""donate my life."" The past mention ""was suicidal like me some time ago"" also indicates past suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" and ""I really wish I could somehow donate my life"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The statement ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and the wish to ""donate my life"" refer to current feelings and intentions.
   - ""I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to the author's past state of being suicidal (past ideation), not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of not wanting to live (""I don't deserve, nor want to live"").
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because while the author mentions having been ""suicidal like me some time ago,"" this describes past ideation, not a concrete past action or attempt. The definition of 'attempt' requires a ""concrete action"".

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to die."", ""Hope it all ends soon."" These are clear expressions of a desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""Stopping all my meds today"" is a concrete action that could lead to death, especially stopping blood pressure medication. However, it is a *passive* method (allowing the body to fail) rather than an *active* method (e.g., taking an overdose, using a weapon). The 'Behavior' definition's examples (lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons, specific locations to jump) imply active, direct means of ending life.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Stopping medication can be seen as a preparation to allow death, aligning with the stated desire to die.
    *   **Crucial consideration:** The rule states, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" While stopping meds is serious, it doesn't fit the direct, active, and immediate nature of the examples provided for 'Behavior'. It's more about disengaging from life-sustaining efforts rather than actively *committing* suicide with a specific, direct tool or action. The other ""methods"" (junk food, wishing for COVID) are clearly passive and not explicit plans for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current intentions and actions (""I'm ready to die,"" ""I'm stopping all my meds today,"" ""Hope it all ends soon"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of past attempts, so 'Attempt' is ruled out.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. 'Behavior' requires explicit thoughts *and* a specific plan/method/preparation. While stopping medication is a concrete action, it is a passive method of allowing death rather than an active, direct method of *committing* suicide as exemplified in the 'Behavior' definition. Given the ambiguity and the instruction to lean towards 'Ideation' if unsure about an explicit plan, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification. The intent to die is clear, but the ""plan"" is not an active, direct suicide method as defined for 'Behavior'.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I just want to disappear,"" ""broken remainings of my soul,"" ""free from all this pain."" These indicate profound distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The phrase ""I just want to disappear"" is vague and does not explicitly state suicide or wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expressions. ""I just want to disappear"" is ambiguous. The 'Indicator' definition states: ""May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits the ""vague feeling"" part.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings/intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional pain and a desire to escape (""disappear,"" ""free from all this pain"").
   - However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or specific suicidal thoughts. The desire to ""disappear"" is vague and does not meet the threshold for explicit suicidal ideation as defined.
   - There are no plans, methods, or past attempts described.
   - Based on the definitions, particularly the 'Indicator' definition which covers ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and ""a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide,"" this post best fits 'Indicator'. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" reinforces this choice.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Key elements: ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"", ""I just need a plan for suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: The rhetorical question and the explicit statement about needing a plan indicate severe distress and suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""I just need a plan for suicide"", which means a plan is *not yet present*.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""kill myself"", ""plan for suicide"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes, ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" implies a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods mentioned: No.
   - Signs of preparation: No. The post states the *need* for a plan, not the existence of one.
   - Since there is no specific plan mentioned, 'behavior' is not appropriate. The definition for 'ideation' states ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"", ""I just need a plan""). No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect as no past attempts are described.
   - 'Behavior' is incorrect because while suicidal thoughts are explicit, there is no specific plan or method mentioned; rather, the post states the *lack* of a plan and the *need* for one. The definition of 'behavior' requires explicit planning or self-harming behavior.
   - 'Ideation' is the best fit. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"", ""I just need a plan for suicide"") but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"". The desire for a plan falls under ideation, not behavior, as the plan itself is absent.

I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (relating to a failed attempt), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"", ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""almost uncontrollably saying"", ""am I crazy or can anyone else relate?"" (suggests distress, seeking understanding).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The ""finger gun"" is a *pretended* action, not a real plan. ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" is a general intention, not a specific plan. There are no concrete plans for a *future* suicide.
   - References to past attempts: ""my most recent failed attempt"" is explicitly stated.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I'm going to kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I wish I stayed in the car"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *future* methods are mentioned. The ""finger gun"" is a pretended action.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post describes involuntary verbalizations and pretended actions, not a concrete plan for a current or future suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - ""I'm going to kill myself"" (involuntary verbalization) and ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" (involuntary verbalization) refer to current thoughts/feelings.
   - ""I wish I stayed in the car"" and ""my most recent failed attempt"" clearly refer to a *past* event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes a ""most recent failed attempt"".
   - The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide."" This is directly met.
   - While there are also current expressions of suicidal thoughts/distress (""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly""), these do not constitute a *current plan* that would push it to 'Behavior'. The primary and most definitive element is the mention of a past attempt. The rule states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Even without a *current plan*, the explicit mention of a *past attempt* is sufficient for the 'Attempt' category.

People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal"") and a desire to not be alive (""I genuinely do not want to live anymore""). This clearly moves it beyond 'indicator'.
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan (e.g., method, location, means) or any preparation. This means it does not fit the 'behavior' category.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category, as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill me"", ""murder me"", ""end my horrible life"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""i beg of you"" indicates strong despair and urgency.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i'll dm the address"", ""please come here and murder me"". This constitutes a specific method (being murdered by someone else) and a specific location offered by the user.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the user is requesting to be murdered, which is a specific (albeit unconventional) method to end their life.

The 'Behavior' definition states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". The statement ""I am planning to kill myself tonight"" directly fulfills this criterion. It is a clear, explicit plan, even without detailing the specific means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""tonight"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts or desires; it explicitly states a ""plan to kill myself tonight.""
    *   Not 'Attempt' because it describes a future intention, not a past action.
    *   The post clearly states ""I am planning to kill myself tonight."" This is an explicit statement of a plan to commit suicide, including a temporal component (""tonight""). According to the 'Behavior' definition, ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". This post fits that definition precisely.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""practicing hanging myself"", ""finally do it"", ""deserves to die"", ""thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy"", ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""My life is fucked now"", ""no turning it around"", ""worthless trash"", ""pain and this fucking shit life"". Strong indicators of hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""practicing hanging myself"", ""keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct"". This explicitly mentions a method (hanging) and active, repeated preparation/rehearsal for it.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are described. ""Practicing"" is a current preparatory action, not a past attempt to end life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""practicing hanging myself"", ""finally do it"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""deserves to die"", ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging myself"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""practicing hanging myself"", ""keep practicing, train myself"". This is a clear sign of preparation and rehearsal of the method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""can't wait for the day when I finally do it"", ""I'm going to keep practicing"", ""will succeed"", ""will be over soon""). The ""practicing"" is an ongoing, current preparatory action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by describing a specific method (""hanging myself"") and, crucially, active preparation and rehearsal for that method (""practicing hanging myself"", ""keep practicing""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".
   - It does not describe a *past completed action* to end life, so 'Attempt' is not appropriate. The ""practicing"" is a current preparatory action, not a past attempt.

Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her. I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this. I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them, to a clueless little dog. I want to die. I want to disappear. I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I want to die. I want to disappear. I will take myself away from here so I can't hurt anyone."" These are direct expressions of suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I know i'm a piece of shit,"" ""feel like absolute shit,"" ""I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them,"" ""I am on the edge."" These indicate strong feelings of self-loathing, despair, and being at a breaking point.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: There are no specific plans, methods (e.g., specific tool, location, substance), or preparations mentioned. ""Take myself away from here"" is a general statement of intent, not a specific plan.
   - References to past attempts: There are no references to past suicide attempts. The post describes past aggressive behavior towards a dog, but not past self-harm or suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: ""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I will take myself away from here."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal ideation.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear; the expressions are direct.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""Take myself away from here"" is vague and does not specify a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan, so this supports 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes past events (snapping at the dog) but the suicidal thoughts are current (""I want to die"") and future-oriented (""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past suicide attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The statement ""I will take myself away from here"" is an intent, not a detailed plan.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly as the post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and end their life, but without detailing a specific plan or method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains the phrase ""I just don't want to exist."" It also explicitly mentions ""Im not suicidal or something"" and ""I think that suicide is selfish."" The word ""suicide"" is used twice.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""feel like trash,"" ""don't know what's wrong with me,"" ""don't know what to do anymore,"" ""anxiety attacks,"" ""draining me,"" ""no purpose in life,"" ""feel like disappointment."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the words ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" are used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just don't want to exist.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the user explicitly states ""Im not suicidal or something,"" the phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire not to be alive. The 'Ideation' definition includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" This phrase perfectly matches that part of the definition, overriding the user's denial of being ""suicidal."" The denial might be about the label or the act, but the underlying thought/feeling of not wanting to exist is present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I just don't want to exist"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for posts lacking *any* explicit expression concerning suicide or a desire to not be alive. The phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" is an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive, which moves it beyond 'indicator'.
    *   **Ideation:** The definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" directly fits ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" There is no specific plan mentioned. Despite the user's denial of being ""suicidal,"" the core feeling of not wanting to exist is clearly articulated, which is a key component of ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** No specific plan or self-harming behavior is mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempts are described.

    Based on the explicit statement ""I just don't want to exist,"" which aligns with ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" in the 'Ideation' definition, and the absence of a plan, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""death,"" ""taking my life"" multiple times, ""suicide,"" ""suicidal,"" and ""attempted suicide.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses profound hopelessness (""never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness""), despair, feeling useless (""useless,"" ""no use to society""), feeling controlled, and a general sense of worthlessness and dissatisfaction with existence.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post *does not* describe a *current* specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. It discusses the *idea* of ""taking my life"" and details a *past* attempt.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, the user explicitly states: ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note..."" and ""(Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness."" This is a clear and detailed description of a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""suicide,"" ""suicidal,"" ""taking my life,"" ""attempted suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""I want to take my life"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for a *current* plan. The discussion of a ""drafted note"" and the ""moments leading up to my attempt"" refer to the *past* attempt.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for a *current* plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to both current intentions/feelings (""I want to take my life"") and a very recent past event (""I attempted suicide last week,"" ""my attempt had failed"").
    *   Past attempts are specifically described in detail.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect, as suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** While there is clear suicidal ideation (""I want to take my life""), the post goes beyond mere thoughts by describing a concrete past action.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect, as there is no mention of a *current* specific plan or ongoing self-harming behavior. The planning mentioned (drafting a note) relates to the *past* attempt.
    *   **Attempt:** This is the most fitting category. The definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide."" The post clearly states, ""I attempted suicide last week... my attempt had failed."" The definition also notes: ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'. Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Even though the post mentions current ideation rather than a concrete *current plan*, the explicit description of a *past, concrete attempt* is the defining characteristic for this category. The presence of current ideation alongside the past attempt reinforces the severity and aligns with the 'Attempt' definition's allowance for concurrent elements.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill you"", ""haven't taken enough"" (implying an action taken with lethal intent), ""want this nightmare to end"" (desire to end suffering/life).
   - Emotional indicators: Fear, despair, hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""valium"" (specific substance/method). The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" indicates a past action involving the method.
   - References to past attempts: ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" strongly implies that the user *has* taken valium with the intent to kill themselves, and is now assessing if the amount was sufficient. This describes a past action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill you"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""just want this nightmare to end"" in context of ""kill you"" and ""valium"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""valium"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that the action of taking the valium has already occurred. This is not just a plan, but an action that has been executed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I haven't taken enough"" refers to a past action (""taken"") and a current evaluation of that past action's outcome. This clearly describes a past event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions a method (""valium"") and describes a past action (""taken"") with suicidal intent (""to kill you""). The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" directly refers to a past attempt that the user believes may not have been successful. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""

I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly mentions ""suicide attempts"" multiple times. Describes self-harm (""sliced hard and fast across my neck""). States ""I don't want to live at all."" Describes ""cheating death"" in multiple scenarios, including a motorcycle accident.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't want to live at all,"" ""really made me scared, it's like I just don't die.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Details past methods: overdose (Unisom pills, prescription cocktail), cutting (straight razor). Details past preparations: buying pills, writing a suicide note, acquiring a razor, gathering prescriptions.
   - References to past attempts: The entire post is a detailed recounting of multiple distinct past suicide attempts (Unisom overdose at 16, razor to the neck in Nov 2020, prescription cocktail in Nov 2020).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide attempts,"" ""my suicide note.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to live at all.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, for *past actions*: overdose, cutting.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, for *past actions*: buying pills, writing a note, gathering prescriptions. The post describes *completed* actions, not current plans.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily past events. The detailed descriptions are all about actions that occurred in the past (""The first one came when I was 16,"" ""Next one was in November 2020""). There is a current feeling (""I don't want to live at all""), but the bulk of the content is about historical attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, in vivid detail, including specific dates, methods, and outcomes.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly and extensively describes multiple past suicide attempts with concrete actions and methods.
   - The definition of 'Attempt' is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
   - This post perfectly fits the 'Attempt' definition as it details multiple concrete past actions. While there is a current expression of not wanting to live (ideation), the dominant and detailed content is about past attempts, which, according to the rule, leads to the 'Attempt' classification.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act described is beyond mere preparation; it is the execution of a method that was then stopped.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes a *past event* (""I put a belt around my neck... tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped...""). This is a concrete action that has already occurred.
    *   It also expresses current/future intentions (""I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch."").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It describes a specific method and an action taken towards it. The crucial part is the description of a *past concrete action* with suicidal intent (""I put a belt around my neck... Right before I passed out, I stopped""). This aligns with the 'Attempt' definition: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past..."".
    *   Furthermore, the 'Attempt' definition explicitly states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post describes a past attempt and also expresses current strong suicidal ideation and a desire to act. Therefore, 'attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""too tired of life"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan or method is mentioned. The post states ""too scared to kill myself"", indicating a lack of immediate intent to act on the ideation, and mentions external deterrents (legality).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"", ""suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""too tired of life"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states a *lack* of action due to fear and legal consequences, not preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and thoughts (""scared"", ""too tired of life""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"", ""too tired of life""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
   - However, it explicitly states ""too scared to kill myself"" and does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation. This absence of a concrete plan or action rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.

This isn't fucking living. We are rotting away and people are acting indifferent to these facts. They consume the news and stuff of the media making themselves ignorant to the basic fact that human life has no fucking purpose other than living as a slave to make the rich richer and to slowly decay. We start dying the second we are born. This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good. So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""We start dying the second we are born."", ""This isn't fucking living."", ""human life has no fucking purpose other than living as a slave to make the rich richer and to slowly decay."", and most critically, ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Fuck this fucking world"", ""miserable lives"", ""rotting away"", ""no fucking purpose"". High levels of despair, hopelessness, nihilism, and anger.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" This indicates a specific timeframe (April) and a clear intent to end life. The phrase ""This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good. So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting."" strongly suggests a planned, public, final act. The ""trip"" is a clear euphemism for the suicidal act itself, presented as a specific future event.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the intent to end one's life is explicitly stated through ""to end this bullshit for good.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""to end this bullshit for good"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear there is a desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? While not a specific tool (like a gun or pills), ""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" functions as a specific plan/method. The ""trip"" is the planned action to achieve the end.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""This will be my second to last post."" and ""So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting."" are strong indicators of preparation for a final, public act.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': I am not uncertain. The combination of a specific timeframe (""April""), a clear intent (""to end this bullshit for good""), and preparatory statements (""second to last post"", ""stay tuned"") clearly points to explicit planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions: ""I'm taking a trip in April"", ""This will be my second to last post.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to end life and a clear plan.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there are explicit suicidal thoughts, there is also a clear, time-bound plan (""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"") and indications of preparation (""second to last post"", ""stay tuned""). The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" The ""trip"" is presented as the way/method/plan.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (""to end this bullshit for good"") and ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide"" (""taking a trip in April""). It also ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" in the sense of planning for it, and includes ""preparations taken"" (""second to last post"", ""stay tuned""). The ""trip"" is the explicit planning for a method/location.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempts are described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I just wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"". This is a direct expression of a desire for death or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""no body cares"", ""no motivation"", ""fucked myself over"", ""parents don't even care"", ""no one left to turn to"", ""don't feel like anything anymore it's just blank"". These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, isolation, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"" are specific methods of ending one's life. There are no signs of preparation mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"" is a direct expression of wanting to die by specific means.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"" are specific methods.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)"". While the phrasing ""I just wish I could"" indicates a desire rather than an active, imminent plan, the *mention* of specific methods (""od on meds"" which falls under ""lethal medication/drugs"", and ""get hit by a car"" which implies a method involving a vehicle/location) is crucial. This goes beyond vague ideation (which is ""without any specific plan""). The presence of concrete methods, even if framed as a wish, aligns more closely with the 'Behavior' category's requirement for ""a specific method"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions (""I just wish I could..."").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' hinges on the presence of a ""specific plan"" or ""specific method"". While the post uses ""I just wish I could"", it *does* mention specific methods (""get hit by a car"", ""od on meds""). The 'Behavior' definition explicitly includes ""a specific method"" as a form of explicit planning. The examples provided for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""lethal medication/drugs"") directly apply to ""od on meds"". Therefore, despite the ""wish"" phrasing, the inclusion of specific methods elevates it beyond general ideation to 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""daily torture of living life,"" ""unwanted in literally all facets of life,"" ""give absolutely everything I own or ever will own."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, and extreme dissatisfaction with life due to perceived unattractiveness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post expresses intense suffering and a desire for a different life/appearance, but not a desire to end life or commit suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""daily torture of living life"" describes suffering *while living*, not a wish to cease living.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear there is no explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It describes current suffering and hypothetical happiness if circumstances were different. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post conveys extreme distress, hopelessness, and a deep sense of being unwanted and suffering in life. This aligns with the ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness"" described in the 'Indicator' definition.
   - Crucially, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The definition for 'Indicator' explicitly states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - Since no desire to die or commit suicide is expressed, and no plan is mentioned, it does not fit 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""me being suicidal"", ""tried to kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""me being suicidal"" indicates current suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for current intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"") and current state/feelings (""me being suicidal"", ""I'm tired"").
   - Past attempts are specifically described (""8 times"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly states ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"", which directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide.""
   - The definition also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While ""me being suicidal"" indicates current ideation, the explicit mention of multiple past attempts is the defining characteristic for this classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""better off dead"" directly implies a desire for death/suicide. The response ""no don't do that"" further contextualizes this as a suicidal thought.
   - Emotional indicators: ""sad"" is mentioned, leading to the ""better off dead"" thought.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""overdose help please"", ""took 44 paracetamol"", ""i dont think i want to die"", ""survive an od like this"", ""did this to myself"". This clearly indicates a self-harming action with potential lethal consequences.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""sorry"", ""don't know where else to post/ask this"", ""stomach is hurting very badly"", ""sweating badly and shaking too"", ""feel like a burden"". These show distress, physical symptoms, and self-blame.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"". This is not a future plan, but a concrete action that has already occurred.
    *   References to past attempts: The post describes a concrete action (""took 44 paracetamol"") that happened in the past (""almost an hour ago"") and is presented as an overdose, which is a type of suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""overdose"" and the context of taking a large amount of medication with physical symptoms and asking if they can ""survive"" strongly imply a life-threatening action, which is an attempt.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The user states ""i dont think i want to die"" *now*, but the action taken (44 paracetamol) implies a prior intent or impulse to die, and the current state is a consequence of that action. The post is about the aftermath of a life-threatening act.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""44 paracetamol"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills is the execution of the action.
    *   This is not a *plan* for the future; it's a description of an *action that has already occurred*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" clearly refers to a past event, a concrete action that has already happened. The physical symptoms (""stomach is hurting"", ""sweating badly and shaking"") are current consequences of that past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Not applicable, as there's a clear self-harming action with lethal potential.
    *   **Ideation:** Not applicable, as a concrete action has been taken, not just thoughts.
    *   **Behavior:** The definition states ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" While ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" could be argued, the ""Attempt"" category specifically covers ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The post describes an overdose that happened ""almost an hour ago,"" fitting the ""Attempt"" definition perfectly.
    *   **Attempt:** This category is the best fit. The post describes a concrete action (""took 44 paracetamol"") that occurred in the past (""almost an hour ago"") and is clearly an overdose, which is a form of suicide attempt. The definition explicitly includes ""overdose"" as an example of a concrete action for 'Attempt'. The user is seeking help *after* the action has been taken.

   - Emotional indicators: ""sick and tired,"" ""can't handle it anymore,"" ""feel nothing and like I'm overloading,"" ""exhausted,"" ""completely hopeless,"" ""not fine."" These indicate severe emotional distress, despair, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: No references to past *suicide* attempts. The mention of ""It's been a year since I last posted here and I'm in the exact same situation"" refers to a recurring emotional state, not a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death"" is present. This is a general statement about hitting rock bottom, not a personal desire for death or suicide. There are no mentions of suicide or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: ""lonely and lost as ever,"" ""really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns."" However, the post also states ""overall better compared to the rest of my life,"" ""feel more like myself,"" ""starting to accept who i am,"" and provides encouragement to others (""find a way to stay positive and stay safe"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None. The ""rock bottom"" described (""having really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years"") refers to severe mental health struggles and physical symptoms, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The mention of ""death"" is in a metaphorical context of hitting rock bottom, not a personal desire to die. The user expresses feeling ""overall better.""
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': There is no explicit desire to die or suicidal thought.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""rock bottom"" and ""bad depression"" refer to past events. The current state is described as ""overall better."" There are no current or future suicidal intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes past struggles and a recent diagnosis, but the overall tone is one of improvement, self-acceptance, and hope.
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, no direct expression of wanting to die, no plans, and no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - The phrase ""nothing lower but death"" is a general, almost philosophical statement about hitting a low point, not an indication of suicidal ideation.

There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""plan on ending it soon"" (euphemism for suicide), ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" (specific method of self-harm/suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""overwhelmed by guilt"", ""don't know what else to do"", ""pain scares me too much"". These indicate distress, hopelessness, and fear.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""overdosibg on ibuprofen is painful or would work but thats likely my go-to plan."" This is a clear mention of a specific method and a ""go-to plan.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""plan on ending it soon"" and the discussion of ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" as a ""go-to plan"" are explicit.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""plan on ending it soon.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdosibg on ibuprofen.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""thats likely my go-to plan"" indicates a decided method, even if the timing is uncertain. This constitutes a specific plan.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is an explicit plan/method (""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" as a ""go-to plan"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""plan on ending it soon"", ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""plan on ending it soon""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly mentions a specific method/plan: ""overdosibg on ibuprofen... thats likely my go-to plan."" This fits the definition of 'behavior' which requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method"". The uncertainty about the *timing* does not negate the existence of a *plan/method*.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Since a specific method/plan is mentioned, it goes beyond 'ideation'.

109,I Relapsed After Almost Two Years. I don't want to get into details but I think I have an addiction to extreme pornography and have had it since I was a kid. Last night/this morning I relapsed and now I feel like shit. If I had a gun I'd kill myself because I know how this goes for me and right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future. I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""feel like shit"", ""not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future"", ""fucked up""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"" mentions a specific method (gun) but it is conditional (""If I had a gun""), implying the means are not currently possessed or being acquired. There are no signs of preparation.
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'd kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'd kill myself"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a gun"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The statement is conditional (""If I had a gun""), indicating a lack of current means or active preparation.
    *   The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" is relevant here. The conditionality makes it less of a concrete plan and more of a strong desire with a hypothetical method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The suicidal thought (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"") refers to a current/future hypothetical intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'd kill myself"") and mentions a method (""a gun""). However, the crucial phrase ""If I had a gun"" indicates that the means are not currently available, and therefore, there is no concrete, actionable plan or preparation in progress. This aligns with the Ideation definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The mention of a method is present, but the conditionality prevents it from being a *plan* as defined for 'Behavior' (which requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"").
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While a method is mentioned, the conditional nature (""If I had a gun"") means there is no explicit plan in terms of having the means or taking preparatory steps. The definition states ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" This post does not indicate preparations or possession of the means.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

    Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit due to the explicit suicidal thought and hypothetical method, without concrete planning or preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""My parents smoking makes my suicidal thoughts worse."" and ""i just wanna kill myself before i have to see him or myself get it"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling trapped, fear for self and brother.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The desire to kill self is conditional on a future event (getting lung cancer).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""wanna kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wanna kill myself"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a desire to kill oneself, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, ruling out 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""suicide plan"", ""kill myself"", ""move on from this worthless existence"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""worthless existence"", ""excited to finally move on"", ""hope I don't get cold feet"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""I've got a suicide plan"" and ""finally got a plan on how i can kill myself"". It also mentions a timeline: ""plan on doing it next week"". The phrases ""My last time posting on this account"" and ""Goodbye reddit"" suggest finality and preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide plan"", ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""finally move on from this worthless existence"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post explicitly states the *existence* of a plan (""I've got a suicide plan"", ""finally got a plan on how i can kill myself"") and a timeline (""next week""). While the specific *details* of the method are not provided, the clear statement of having a plan and intending to act on it (""plan on doing it next week"") aligns with the 'Behavior' definition which includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""My last time posting on this account"" and ""Goodbye reddit"" indicate a farewell, which can be a sign of preparation. The scheduling (""next week"") also implies a concrete plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""plan on doing it next week"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are clear suicidal thoughts and a plan.
   - Not 'Ideation' because the post explicitly states the existence of a ""suicide plan"" and a timeline (""next week""), moving beyond mere thoughts or desires to a concrete intention with a plan. The definition of 'Ideation' states ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"", and 'Behavior' states ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". This post fits the 'Behavior' definition perfectly.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a future intention, not a past action.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""attempted suicide in the past.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Feeling bad,"" ""long history of depression,"" ""pushed me back down,"" ""massive amounts of pain,"" ""feel terrible about it,"" ""feel like a piece of crap."" Indicates significant distress and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific current plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The user is seeking help.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago).""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""attempted suicide.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I've begun having those thoughts again"" refers to the recurrence of suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The user is actively seeking help.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both a past suicide attempt (""many years ago"") and the current recurrence of ""suicidal thoughts."" The current context is about seeking help for these thoughts and pain.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This describes a concrete past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly states ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This directly matches the primary definition of the 'Attempt' category: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide.""
    *   While the post also mentions current ""suicidal thoughts"" (which would fall under 'Ideation'), the explicit mention of a past attempt takes precedence as it represents a higher level of historical risk and a concrete past action. The 'Attempt' definition's note about ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" is an additional condition, not a limiting one. The core definition is met.
    *   There are no current plans or self-harming behaviors mentioned, so 'Behavior' is not applicable.
    *   There are explicit mentions of suicide, so 'Indicator' is not applicable.
    *   Given the direct statement of a past suicide attempt, 'Attempt' is the most accurate classification.

It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) and ""I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best."" There are no explicit mentions of suicide, death, or dying.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""can't socialize well,"" ""suffering,"" ""afraid he won't want baggage like me,"" ""go insane,"" ""so many issues,"" ""depression,"" ""It's getting to be too much."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific suicide plan or method is mentioned. ""Cutting"" is mentioned, but explicitly as a coping mechanism that the user *cannot* currently do (""I can't even cut because my bf will see""). This indicates an *absence* of current self-harming behavior or a plan for it.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The word ""suicide"" is not used, nor are direct synonyms or phrases like ""want to die"" or ""end my life.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die, this leans towards 'indicator'. The mention of ""thoughts of sh"" refers to self-harm, which is distinct from suicidal ideation, especially as framed here as a coping mechanism.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""Cutting"" is mentioned, but the post states ""I can't even cut,"" indicating it is not a current plan or action. It's described as a desired (but currently inhibited) coping mechanism, not a suicide method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit suicide plan, so 'behavior' is not applicable.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and ongoing struggles (""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""I can't socialize,"" ""I'm suffering,"" ""It's getting to be too much""). ""Thoughts of sh"" are ongoing thoughts. No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses extreme distress, depression, and mentions ""thoughts of sh"" and an inability to use ""cutting"" as a coping mechanism.
    *   However, the definitions are very strict about explicit mentions of suicide or a desire to die for 'Ideation'. The post does *not* contain ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    *   The 'Indicator' definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   Despite the high distress and mention of self-harm, the crucial element of explicit suicidal intent or desire to die is absent. The self-harm is framed as a coping mechanism, not a suicidal act. Therefore, based on the strict definitions and the rule to lean towards 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit suicide mention, this post falls into the 'indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""when I die"", ""my pain is finally over"", ""I'm dead"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""pain"", ""happy"" (in the context of death).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" and ""Don't be sad when I die."" clearly express a desire for death as an end to suffering.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The desire to die is explicit enough to move beyond 'indicator'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" and ""don't want to live"". It also uses ""goodbye"", indicating a final farewell.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""don't care about anything anymore"", ""life is all downhill"", ""career dreams are ruined"", ""never have kids"", ""nothing in my life"" all point to extreme hopelessness, despair, and a sense of loss.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""take the leap"" in the context of ""kill myself"" strongly implies a method (jumping). While not specifying a location, it's more than a vague desire to die. The word ""goodbye"" is a clear preparation, indicating a final communication before an intended action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"" indicates a past period of suicidal thoughts or crisis, but not a concrete past *attempt* (e.g., ""I overdosed last month"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""don't want to live"".
    *   Conclusion: This post clearly goes beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""take the leap"" implies jumping, which is a method. While the location isn't specified, the method itself is implied.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""goodbye"" is a strong sign of preparation, acting as a final farewell.
    *   The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". ""Goodbye"" is a preparation. ""Take the leap"" is a decision to act with an implied method. This combination suggests a plan is in place.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"" refers to a current decision and future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, ""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"" refers to past suicidal ideation/crisis, not a concrete past attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mention.
    *   Not 'Attempt' as no past concrete action is described.
    *   Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is ""without any specific plan"". This post contains more than just a desire to die; it states a *decision* to act (""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"") and includes a clear preparation (""goodbye""). The phrase ""take the leap"" strongly implies a method (jumping), even if the exact location isn't given. The combination of a decided action, an implied method, and a farewell note (""goodbye"") fits the 'Behavior' definition of ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The ""goodbye"" is a preparation, and ""take the leap"" is a strong indication of a method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"", ""Goodbye"". These strongly indicate an intent to end life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel so relaxed that it's finally ending"" - suggests acceptance and relief about ending life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. No tools, locations, or specific actions are described.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but phrases like ""end it all"" and ""call it quits"" are direct expressions of wanting to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""before i end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"". This clearly indicates a desire to not be alive any longer.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparation (like acquiring means, specific location, or method). The post itself acts as a farewell, but doesn't detail *how* they will end it. The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". This is absent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""before i end it all"", ""finally ending"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are clear, explicit expressions of wanting to end life, not just general distress.
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan, method, or detailed preparation mentioned. The definition explicitly states ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes current/future intent, not a past action.
   - This fits 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post clearly expresses a strong desire to end life without detailing how.

She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post describes a situation where a friend of the poster ""tried to kill herself"" three days ago and is now unreachable. The poster expresses concern (""I need help"", ""I'm scared"") and asks for advice on how to know if the friend is okay. The key elements are the mention of someone else's past suicide attempt and the poster's distress and concern for that person. There are no mentions of the poster's own suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""tried to kill herself""), but this refers to another person, not the poster. There are no direct expressions from the poster of wanting to die or not be alive.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific plans or methods are mentioned by the poster for themselves. The post refers to someone else's past action.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to a past event (""she had tried to kill herself three days ago"") involving another person, and the poster's current concern about that person's well-being. It does not describe the poster's own past attempts or current/future intentions regarding suicide.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The crucial rule here is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"". The post clearly describes a past suicide attempt by *another person*. The poster is expressing concern and seeking help for *that person's* situation, not their own suicidal thoughts or actions. While the poster expresses distress (""I need help"", ""I'm scared""), this distress is related to the friend's situation and not indicative of the poster's own suicidal ideation or behavior. Therefore, since there is no explicit expression of suicide, desire to die, plans, or past attempts *from the person writing the post*, it falls under 'Indicator' as it's general distress and concern.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I will hang myself now"", ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it"", ""I don't think the thing will break off as I am only 44kg"" (indicates consideration of method effectiveness).
   - References to past attempts: ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" indicates past self-harm, but not a past suicide attempt. The focus is on current intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I will hang myself now"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to be alone anymore"", ""kill me with it"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"", ""looking for something that I can tie"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie"". This indicates active steps being taken to acquire the means for the stated method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I will hang myself now"", ""I'm now looking for something"" clearly indicates current and immediate intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past self-harm, not a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts by stating a specific method (""hang myself"") and actively describing steps to prepare for it (""looking for something that I can tie""). This rules out 'Ideation'.
   - The content describes a current plan and active preparation, not a past completed action. This rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific plan/method, and active preparation (looking for means) perfectly matches the definition of 'Behavior'.

I only feel just so very miserable (not sure if that is the right word to describe it) nothing more, nothing less, and it sucks. I can barely function. I don't even know how to just live anymore. It feels like I am being ripped apart and put back together incorrectly. I can't stop shaking. How am I supposed to live like this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This is a direct *negation* of wanting to die. The word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Emotional indicators: ""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" ""miserable,"" ""sucks,"" ""can barely function,"" ""ripped apart and put back together incorrectly,"" ""can't stop shaking,"" ""How am I supposed to live like this?"" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and difficulty coping.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post explicitly states the *opposite*: ""It's not even that I just want to die.""
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is not unclear; there is an explicit negation of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes current feelings and an inability to cope in the present. There are no references to past events or future intentions regarding suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant general distress, misery, and a feeling of being unable to function or live. However, it *lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide* and, more importantly, *explicitly negates a desire to die*.
   - According to the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This perfectly matches the content.
   - The 'Ideation' category requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which is directly contradicted by the post.
   - 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are clearly not applicable as there are no plans, self-harm, or past attempts mentioned.

You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly states ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (die), mentions ""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicidal courage and determination"". The phrase ""If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames."" strongly implies suicide with a specific, destructive manner.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""DEPRESSED"", ""frightened"", ""coward"", ""Everyone hates themselves"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes. The post describes:
        *   ""With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem...""
        *   ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also."" (This is a clear instruction for acquiring means/preparation).
        *   ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" (This specifies a location and action).
        These are presented as the way to ""Go out with bang, and big flames"" which is linked to the earlier desire to ""DOIE"".
    *   **References to past attempts:** No.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I WANT TO DOIE"", ""suicidal thoughts"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"" for ""mayhem"", ""make nitroglycerin at home"", targeting ""power plants"". These are presented as the means to ""Go out with bang, and big flames"" when the poster decides to ""do it"" (die).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also"" and ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area"". This constitutes explicit planning and acquiring means/location.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Not 'Ideation' because there are explicit mentions of methods and preparations for a destructive act that is linked to the desire to die (""Go out with bang, and big flames"" as the way to ""do it""). The instructions to learn how to make nitroglycerin and target power plants constitute a specific plan and preparation.
    *   Not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I WANT TO DOIE"") and also mentions a specific plan for a destructive act (""make nitroglycerin"", ""power plants"") which is presented as the way to ""go out with a bang"" (i.e., end their life). This fits the 'Behavior' definition of ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior.

Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now.

She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself.

With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post quotes the bully telling the friend to ""go kill yourself."" This is a statement directed at the friend, not an expression from the person writing the post about themselves.
   - Emotional indicators: The post describes the *friend* as ""mentally disturbing,"" ""constantly tired,"" ""not doing well,"" and ""overwhelmed."" The poster expresses concern for their friend and a desire for ""justice.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the person writing the post.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned by the person writing the post.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as a quote from the bully to the friend (""go kill yourself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the person writing the post. The post is about the friend's situation and the poster's desire to help.
   - The rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"" is crucial here. The explicit mention of suicide is directed *at* the friend, not *by* the poster about themselves.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes ongoing bullying and the poster's current concern for their friend. There are no suicidal intentions (past, present, or future) expressed by the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post is written by a concerned individual about their friend who is being severely bullied.
   - While the word ""suicide"" is present, it is a direct quote from the bully to the friend, not an expression of suicidal ideation by the person writing the post.
   - The post describes the *friend's* distress and the poster's desire to help their friend and seek justice.
   - According to the rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned,"" the content does not indicate suicide risk for the poster.
   - There are no explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, plans, or past attempts from the person who wrote the post. Therefore, it fits the 'indicator' category as it lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide from the author, even though it describes distress related to someone else.

   - Emotional indicators: ""loser, ugly, no motivation, isolated"", ""Alot of mental illness"", ""feel so alone"", ""nothing to look forward to"", ""small piece of hope left in me but I really don't know how much longer I could last"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I want to hang myself so bad"" is a specific method.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself"", ""I really don't know how much longer I could last here on earth"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""I want to hang myself so bad"". This is a clear, specific method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned, but the desire to use a specific method is present.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I wish I had..."", ""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""I want to hang myself"", ""how much longer I could last"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond just suicidal thoughts by mentioning a specific method (""hang myself""), which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' (""mentions... a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method"").
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""unfortunately"", ""still want to attempt again"" (indicates ongoing distress/desire to die).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for current or future actions.
    *   References to past attempts: ""last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?"". This is a very clear and explicit mention of multiple past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""attempted"", ""attempt again"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""still alive unfortunately"", ""still want to attempt again"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current or future intentions.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?"" refers to past, concrete actions.
    *   ""still want to attempt again"" refers to current ideation/desire.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly describes *past attempts* at suicide (""last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?""). This directly matches the core definition of the 'Attempt' category: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    *   While the post also includes current ideation (""still want to attempt again""), the presence of described past attempts is the defining characteristic for the 'Attempt' category. The rule states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Although ""still want to attempt again"" is ideation, not a specific plan, the primary and most severe element is the documented history of concrete attempts. The category 'Attempt' is specifically for describing past actions.

These phrases indicate severe distress, a physical state consistent with self-harm or a partial attempt, and a desire not to wake up (i.e., to die). The phrase ""go all the way through"" implies a lethal action.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Everything's crumbling"", ""I don't see a reason"", ""scared"", ""sad"", ""alone"", ""can't reach out"". High levels of hopelessness, despair, and fear.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No explicit method (e.g., ""pills"", ""knife"") is named. However, the description of the physical state (""breath slowing down"", ""chest hurting"", ""falling asleep"") strongly implies an action has been taken that leads to these effects, likely a substance. The phrase ""still too scared to go all the way through"" suggests a current action that is a partial or non-lethal attempt.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" This is a direct and explicit reference to past actions that are similar to a current one, implying past attempts or self-harming behaviors.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" and ""I'm at the end of my rope."" This clearly expresses a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not by name, but the *effects* of a method are described (""breath slowing down,"" ""chest hurting,"" ""falling asleep""). This suggests an action has been taken.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the current physical state implies an action has occurred.
    *   The post describes a *current physical state* resulting from an action, and the phrase ""still too scared to go all the way through"" implies a *partial action* or *self-harming behavior* rather than a fully committed plan for a future lethal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""as I've done this before"" refers to past events. ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting"" describes a current physical state. ""I know I'll wake up later"" and ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" refer to future expectations and desires based on the current action.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" explicitly states past actions that were attempts or similar behaviors.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""hope I don't wake up"").
    *   It describes a current physical state that is a result of an action, implying self-harming behavior or a partial attempt.
    *   Crucially, it explicitly references *past attempts* or similar actions: ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up.""
    *   The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While the current state is more of an ongoing behavior than a future ""plan,"" the explicit mention of ""done this before"" (past attempts) is the strongest classifying factor. The current action is a repetition of past non-lethal attempts.

Final Classification: The post explicitly mentions past attempts (""as I've done this before"") and describes a current physical state consistent with an ongoing or just-completed action that is a partial attempt (""I feel my breath slowing down... I'm still too scared to go all the way through""). This combination fits the 'Attempt' category, especially given the rule that if past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans/behaviors, it should be classified as 'attempt'.

    *   It is not 'Attempt' because the post explicitly states ""I never did it"" regarding past intent, and the current situation describes an imminent plan, not a completed past action.

   - Emotional indicators: ""depression"", ""stress"", ""feeling unappreciated"", ""depressed middle child that would cry at midnight"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""leave a note for my parents"", ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed the bleach"".
   - References to past attempts: The entire narrative describes an event ""a week ago"" where the user took a concrete action (swallowing bleach) and prepared (left a note) with the intent to end their life.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal episodes"", ""suicide episode"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""its my last time with them"", ""i thought that was the last breath i have"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""leave a note for my parents"".
   - This section describes a *past* plan and method that was executed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post explicitly describes an event that happened ""a week ago"". While the user mentions ""its still in there"" and ""im doing better now"", the core of the post is a detailed recounting of a past event.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the act of leaving a note and swallowing bleach with the intent to die is a clear description of a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly describes a concrete action taken in the past (""a week ago"") with the intent to end life (""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"", ""leave a note""). This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The post describes an overdose of bleach.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""lost all will to live"" and ""I still want to die"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear there's a desire to die, which falls under 'ideation' definition (""a desire to not be alive any longer"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan or method mentioned.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I still want to die"" indicates current intentions. The loss of the sibling is a past event leading to the current feelings.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""lost all will to live"", ""I still want to die""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, which rules out 'behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, which rules out 'attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end."" It also says, ""my end will only get nearer,"" indicating a contemplation of death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""deepest depths of myself and darkest corners,"" ""deeper than I've ever been,"" ""worse off than before."" These indicate severe hopelessness and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user mentions taking ""a few tabs of acid and see what happens first."" However, this is presented as a last resort to *avoid* suicide or to cope, not as a method of suicide itself. The phrasing ""if it helps me then hey that's great , if it doesn't , I'll be back in the same spot or worse off than before and my end will only get nearer"" clearly separates the acid use from the suicidal outcome, implying suicide is the alternative if the acid fails to help. No specific method or plan for suicide is described.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""thinking of suicide for months on end.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""my end will only get nearer,"" and ""I'm fine with either outcome"" (referring to either getting better or suicide getting nearer).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for *suicide* is mentioned. The acid is presented as a potential coping mechanism or a last attempt to feel better, not as a means to end life.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months on end"") and future intentions (""my end will only get nearer,"" ""I'll be back in the same spot or worse off than before"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months on end"") and a desire for death (""my end will only get nearer"") if the acid doesn't help. It lacks any specific plan or method for *how* to commit suicide. The acid is a separate, non-suicidal action intended to alleviate distress. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific plan or method for suicide mentioned. The acid is not a suicide method in this context. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past suicide attempt is described.

Based on the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without a concrete plan or method for suicide, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of suicide, death, or dying. The user mentions stealing hydrocodone and drinking, but this is framed as an attempt ""to feel ok for one night,"" not as a suicidal act or self-harm with suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hit a new low tonight,"" ""havent felt ok in a while,"" ""im not sure what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feeling overwhelmed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans or methods for suicide are mentioned. The drug use is for coping, not for ending life.
   - References to past attempts: No references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': There is no explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die. The distress is general and focused on not feeling ""ok.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for suicide. The hydrocodone and alcohol are for coping with distress, not for a suicide plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable, as there is no suicidal ideation expressed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current distress and a recent coping action (""tonight i stole...""). There are no past suicide attempts mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being at a ""new low."" It describes self-medication (stealing hydrocodone, drinking) as a way to ""feel ok,"" which indicates a struggle to cope. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts or plans. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" The post fits the definition of 'Indicator' perfectly as it shows general distress without any explicit suicidal content.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""dying.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I see no point in living anymore,"" ""I don't have any friends,"" ""Nothing in my life is working out"" - indicates severe hopelessness, despair, and a lack of purpose or desire to continue living.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I see no point in living anymore"" is a direct expression of not wanting to continue living, which aligns with ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" as described in the 'Ideation' definition.
    *   The 'Ideation' definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post clearly expresses this desire. The 'Indicator' definition states ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Since a desire *is* expressed, it moves beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   This rules out 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I see no point in living anymore"").
    *   No past attempts are described. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear ""desire to not be alive any longer"" (""I see no point in living anymore""). This directly matches the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not contain any specific plan or method, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death by explicitly stating a lack of desire to continue living, thus it is not 'Indicator' based on the 'Ideation' definition's clarification (""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow."" This directly implies an overdose, which is a method of self-harm intended to cause death.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""fucked up I am,"" ""unfair on them,"" ""feel so guilty,"" ""I'm sorry you do now"" indicate significant distress, guilt, and a sense of burden.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes a specific method (overdose) and indicates that the action has already occurred.
    *   References to past attempts: The phrasing ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is in the past tense, describing an action that has already happened. ""might not wake up tomorrow"" refers to the potential future consequence of this past action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""might not wake up tomorrow"" as a result of ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a very strong, albeit implicit, expression of wanting to die or not be alive. The action itself is a direct expression of intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills"" (implying an overdose) is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is the execution of a method, not just preparation. It's an action already taken.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': This is beyond planning; it's an action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is past tense, indicating an action that has already occurred. ""might not wake up tomorrow"" refers to the future outcome of that past action. This describes a concrete action that has happened.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** No, because there is a clear action and implied intent to die.
    *   **Ideation:** No, because it goes beyond just thoughts or desires and describes a concrete action taken.
    *   **Behavior:** The definition states ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" While ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is self-harming behavior, the 'Behavior' category focuses on *current plans* or *exhibiting* (present tense) behavior. The act of ""taken"" is past tense.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes a concrete action (an overdose) that has happened in the past (even if very recently). This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'. The post is describing a completed action that is a suicide attempt.

The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" However, the presence of a past attempt is a key factor here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to both past events (""fear of failing an attempt once again"") and current/future intentions (""I'm planning out my suicide"", ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and a desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.

   - Emotional indicators: Not explicitly stated, but the actions described indicate significant distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""hang myself"", ""leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto"". This describes a specific method and a form of preparation, but within the context of past actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""attempt suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post states ""so i don't die"", indicating a lack of desire to die in these specific instances. However, the *action* is still described as an ""attempt suicide"".

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to a current life situation and current emotional state. There is no mention of past events or future intentions related to suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses distress and dissatisfaction with life circumstances, evidenced by the initial statement and the subsequent emotional outburst.
    *   However, it *lacks any explicit mention* of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts or plans.
    *   According to the definitions, 'Indicator' is for posts that ""lack any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and may include ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" or ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    *   Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to not be alive, it does not fit 'Ideation'. There are no plans or self-harm, so it's not 'Behavior'. There are no past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

I'll break killing myself regardless.I just wish I could die in my sleep instead. Maybe I'll get lucky and increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself"", ""die"", ""cutting again"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""not afraid"", ""wish I could die in my sleep"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""figured out how to properly hang myself"", ""start cutting again"".
   - References to past attempts: ""I've done it many times"".
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""killing myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes (""I'll finally do it"", ""wish I could die in my sleep"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods mentioned: Yes (""hang myself"", ""cutting again"").
   - Signs of preparation: ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" indicates knowledge/planning.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to past events: ""I've done it many times"".
   - Refers to current/future intentions: ""One of these days I'll finally do it"", ""I'll break killing myself regardless"", ""start cutting again"".
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It mentions specific methods and plans (""hang myself"", ""cutting again""), which goes beyond 'Ideation'.
   - Crucially, it describes past actions: ""I've done it many times"". The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post clearly describes past attempts (""I've done it many times"") and also current/future plans (""figured out how to properly hang myself"", ""I'll finally do it"", ""start cutting again""). Therefore, it fits the 'Attempt' category perfectly.

For over the course of a year I've been having some thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all. Like I'm feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all"" is a strong indication of suicidal ideation. ""Feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing"" reinforces a desire to cease existing.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't know if I'm feeling too alright,"" ""haven't slept,"" ""feeling doomed"" indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""end it all"" is a very common and direct euphemism for ending one's life.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""thoughts...telling me to end it all"" is a direct expression of a desire to end one's life. This is more than a vague feeling; it's an internal command or thought about a specific action. The Ideation definition includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" ""End it all"" clearly conveys this desire. While the 'Indicator' definition emphasizes ""very explicit"" mention of suicide and choosing 'indicator' when in doubt, ""end it all"" is a widely understood and direct phrase for ending one's life, making the suicidal thought explicit even without the specific word ""suicide.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   Since no plan or method is mentioned, this rules out 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes ongoing thoughts (""For over the course of a year I've been having some thoughts..."") and current feelings (""Currently 8:26 am, I haven't slept and I have a class in about 20 minutes,"" ""I'm feeling doomed""). This indicates current/ongoing ideation, not a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' as there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    *   The choice is between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" through the phrase ""end it all."" This is not merely general distress or a vague feeling about death; it's a direct thought about ending one's existence. While the word ""suicide"" isn't present, ""end it all"" is a clear and commonly understood proxy for suicidal intent. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' better than 'Indicator', which requires a *lack* of explicit expression concerning suicide or only vague feelings about death. The phrase ""end it all"" is a strong, explicit indication of suicidal thoughts.

Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell.

My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains direct expressions of not wanting to live (""Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful""). Crucially, it explicitly describes past actions: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in."" These are descriptions of past suicide attempts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of despair, self-loathing, hopelessness are evident (""Suffering from depression and anxiety for years,"" ""hate myself,"" ""my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell,"" ""Useless, shameless, pathetic loser,"" ""miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Methods are mentioned (""drown myself,"" ""hang,"" ""jump off from the 4th floor""), but these are explicitly stated as *past* actions, not current plans or preparations.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, explicitly and repeatedly: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the descriptions of trying to drown, hang, and jump from a building are explicit mentions of actions intended to end one's life. Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Why should I still live..."").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""drown myself,"" ""hang,"" ""jump off from the 4th floor.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No *current* signs of preparation. The methods refer to *past* actions.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This rule applies to *current* planning. Since the methods are for *past* actions, this points towards 'attempt'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The most significant elements are the descriptions of *past attempts*: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor... But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time."" While there is current ideation (""Why should I still live""), the explicit recounting of concrete past actions is the defining temporal context.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, in detail.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:** Based on the analysis, the post clearly describes *past attempts at suicide*. The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'. Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The user describes concrete actions (""tried to drown,"" ""tried to hang,"" ""tried to jump"") that happened in the past, even if they ""chickened out."" This perfectly fits the 'Attempt' definition.

    *   **References to past attempts:** The phrase ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old"" refers to a past *desire* or *thought* of suicide, not a concrete past *action* or *attempt*. It's a hypothetical statement about what *would have happened* if it were easier.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post discusses gaining ""courage to do it,"" but ""it"" is not defined by a specific method or plan. There is no indication of acquiring means or making specific arrangements.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The reference to ""when I was 15 years old"" describes a past hypothetical desire, not a past attempt.
    *   The statements ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"" and ""I might actually get the courage to do it"" refer to current feelings and potential future intentions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit mentions of suicide and a clear desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" and ""stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life (albeit without a specific plan how to do so)."" The phrases ""confident to kill myself"" and ""might actually get the courage to do it"" clearly express suicidal thoughts and a desire to act, but lack a concrete plan.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. The post explicitly states the difficulty of suicide, which contradicts having a concrete plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the reference to the past (""would have been gone when I was 15"") is a hypothetical desire, not a description of a concrete past action or attempt. The definition states ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past... When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'.""

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, but without any specific plan or method.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""pain is too much"", ""hide it better""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours"". This clearly states a method (Trazodone + alcohol) and a timeline/intent.
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit past attempts are mentioned. The phrase ""'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better"" suggests past struggles or thoughts, but not a concrete past attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Emotional indicators: The question itself implies a consideration of suicidal action.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific method (carbon monoxide poisoning) and location. The question ""Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?"" is an inquiry into the feasibility of a specific method.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not a direct statement of desire, but a direct question about a specific method for suicide, which strongly implies suicidal intent or exploration of it.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""charcoal bbq in a tent"". This is a concrete, specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The question is an inquiry into the viability of a specific method, which is a step towards planning. It's not vague ideation; it's exploring a concrete way to commit suicide. The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Asking about the possibility of a specific method falls under exploring a specific plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (exploring a potential method).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a specific method is discussed.
    *   **Ideation:** This category is for explicit suicidal thoughts *without* a specific plan. The post *does* mention a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") and asks about its possibility. This goes beyond general thoughts and into exploring a specific ""way/location/means/method,"" which, according to the Ideation definition, would push it to 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior:** The post includes explicit mention of suicide and a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent""). The question about its possibility indicates exploring a specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" and ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)"".
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes no past action.

    The key differentiator between Ideation and Behavior here is the specificity of the method. Asking about the possibility of using a ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" for suicide is a specific inquiry into a method, which constitutes exploring a plan, rather than just a general desire to die.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""makes me want want to die"" and ""I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that suicidal thoughts are present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and thoughts (""makes me want want to die,"" ""I just think everyone would be better off"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""want want to die"" and the thought ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings.
    *   The phrase ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" indicates a lack of immediate intent to act, but it does not negate the presence of the suicidal *thought* or *feeling* that others would be better off without them, or the general desire to die.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'Indicator' is incorrect because there *are* explicit mentions of wanting to die and suicidal thoughts.
        *   'Behavior' is incorrect because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
        *   'Attempt' is incorrect because no past attempts are described.
        *   'Ideation' is the best fit: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""want to die,"" ""everyone would be better off without me"") without a plan. The denial of immediate intent (""I don't feel like actually committing die"") positions it within the range of ideation, specifically as a thought or feeling rather than an active desire to execute a plan.

147,My heart hurts and I want to die. My long term bf and I got into a bad fight. All because I thought I asked a harmless question and it spiraled. Usually when we fight we always end positively but this time it felt different. It ended badly. It was more let's just forget this happened. We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time. I loved him so much and felt so lucky to be with him. I don't really know what to do. I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down. It hurts so much and I just feel like dying. I just wish I had someone to talk to,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying.""
   - Emotional indicators: High levels of distress, heartbreak, hopelessness, despair, feeling like ""the worst person,"" and a sense of a relationship crumbling.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, multiple direct expressions: ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" ""I just feel like dying."" These are clear expressions of a desire to not be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear; there are direct expressions of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit planning mentioned, so 'ideation' is preferred over 'behavior' if there were any ambiguity, but here there is no planning at all.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The expressions of wanting to die refer to current feelings and intentions (""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live""). The relationship fight is a past event, but the suicidal thoughts are current.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" ""I just feel like dying""). This clearly moves it beyond 'indicator'.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, which rules out 'behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, which rules out 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post uses the phrase ""I can't do it anymore"" in the context of extreme distress and a ""3 weeks to turn around"" timeframe, implying an end if things don't improve. Crucially, it states, ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the 'dog' put itself down."" The ""dog"" is a metaphor for the self, and ""put down"" is a clear euphemism for euthanasia/killing oneself. This is an explicit, albeit metaphorical, mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Im tired,"" ""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Nothing's real to me anymore,"" ""I can't find a way to release,"" ""I can't find a way to fix them. Fix myself. anything,"" ""Why do I have to be like this?"", ""I'm an abomination,"" ""What is wrong with me."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and self-loathing.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""3 weeks to turn around,"" which is a timeframe for the situation to improve, not a specific plan for suicide. While ""put down"" implies a method, it's used metaphorically for the self and lacks any concrete details about *how* a human would ""put themselves down"" (e.g., specific tools, locations, substances). There are no signs of preparation (e.g., suicide note, acquiring means).
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the metaphorical ""put itself down,"" which clearly refers to ending one's own life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't do it anymore"" and the metaphorical ""put itself down"" convey a desire to end suffering/life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The method ""put down"" is mentioned, but it's metaphorical for the self. No specific tools, locations, or substances for human suicide are mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Given the lack of concrete, actionable details for a human suicide plan, it leans towards ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""3 weeks to turn around"" and ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down"" refer to current distress and future intentions/potential outcomes.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""I can't do it anymore,"" ""put itself down""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - It does not describe a past attempt, so 'attempt' is ruled out.
   - The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' is crucial. 'Behavior' requires explicit planning, including a specific method or preparations (e.g., specific tools, locations, substances, notes). While the post uses the metaphor ""put down,"" it lacks any concrete, actionable details for *how* the person would commit suicide. The ""3 weeks"" is a deadline for the situation to improve, not a plan for an action. Therefore, it expresses suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. This fits the definition of 'ideation'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" reinforces this choice.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months,"" ""suicide pact with yourself,"" ""my demise,"" ""I don't think I would do 'it'.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""slump and horrid hole of thoughts,"" ""enormous sense of relief,"" ""calmed me down,"" ""not scared,"" ""feel better,"" ""shame, or guilt,"" ""torment of thoughts,"" ""manageable,"" ""hate the lingering emotional aftermath,"" ""tired,"" ""fucking delicate,"" ""cannot stand being weak,"" ""my problems lie in my brain,"" ""feel different,"" ""not able to connect,"" ""can't 'click' into life.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months"" (indicates planning). ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" (a concrete preparation). The negations ""I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household"" imply consideration of methods and how to execute them, even if ruling some out.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned. ""Plotting"" is planning, not an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times: ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" ""suicide pact,"" ""my demise.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly through the ""plotting"" and the general despair, and explicitly ""I just can't 'click' into life."" ""I am just tired.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *chosen* method is mentioned. However, the post explicitly states ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" This is a clear sign of preparation for death, often associated with suicide planning. The phrase ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months"" also indicates a history of developing plans.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""drafted my will"" is a concrete preparatory action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months"" refers to ongoing, past, and potentially recurring ideation/planning.
    *   ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" describes a concrete past action of preparation.
    *   ""Today, I feel better. I don't think I would do 'it'. I am out of my hole for now."" indicates a current reduction in immediate risk, but the post is still discussing the *history* and *nature* of these thoughts and preparations. The ""lingering emotional aftermath"" and ""feeling like I am not following through"" also refer to the persistence of these thoughts/feelings.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. Suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is clear ideation, the post goes beyond just thoughts by describing a concrete preparatory action (""drafted my will"") and a history of ""plotting."" The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While no *method* is chosen, a *preparation* (drafting a will) is mentioned, which falls under 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""plotting my suicide,"" ""thought of suicide"") and explicitly mentions a preparation taken: ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)."" A will serves as a preparation for one's death. The ongoing ""plotting"" also suggests a level of planning. Even though the user states they feel better *now* and ""don't think I would do 'it',"" the described actions (plotting, drafting a will) are past behaviors indicating a high level of risk engagement.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past suicide attempt is described. The actions mentioned are preparations, not attempts.

    The drafting of a will is a strong indicator of concrete preparatory behavior, moving this beyond mere ideation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is present. This suggests a feeling of being a burden or worthlessness, which can be an indirect indicator of distress, but it is not an explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses significant distress: ""i hate tough love,"" ""stressed,"" ""not in a good mood,"" ""brings me anxiety,"" ""sick of this endless myopic bouts of 'criticism',"" ""abused enough at home,"" ""don't need this shit among my friends,"" ""i want it to stop,"" ""if i leave them i have no one."" These indicate feelings of hopelessness, despair, anxiety, and social isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The closest is ""i feel like he would be better off without me,"" which is an expression of feeling like a burden, not a direct desire to end one's own life.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is vague regarding direct suicidal intent. It expresses a feeling about how others might perceive their absence, rather than a personal desire to die. According to the rules, if there's doubt about explicit mention, lean towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and ongoing difficult social interactions. There is no mention of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong emotional indicators of distress, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, and social isolation (""if i leave them i have no one""). It expresses a ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness.""
    *   However, it lacks any *explicit* expression of suicidal thoughts or a direct desire to not be alive. The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is not a direct statement of wanting to die or commit suicide.
    *   The definition of 'indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of suicide, death, or self-harm related to the poster. There is a phrase ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally,"" which implies a wish for someone else's absence or demise, not the poster's own.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme anger (""FUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCFFFKKKKKKKK YOUUUUU"", ""i fucking hate you""), profound exhaustion (""i'm so tired"", ""i have no more energy to deal with this anymore""), despair and hopelessness about the world (""the world is just fucked in every single way"", ""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for the poster.
   - References to past attempts: None for the poster.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the perspective of the person writing the post. The despair is directed outwards at another person and the state of the world.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There are no explicit self-directed suicidal statements.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Not applicable as there is no ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current intense emotional distress and anger stemming from past events related to ""her"" and ""them."" There are no current or future intentions of self-harm.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses intense distress, anger, exhaustion, and a generalized sense of hopelessness about life and the world. This aligns with ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness.""
   - However, it *lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide* or a desire for the poster themselves to not be alive. The anger and despair are directed externally.
   - Based on the definition of 'Indicator' (""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""), this post fits best into the 'Indicator' category. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (no explicit desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan), or 'Attempt' (no past attempt described).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself, but."" This is a direct mention of suicide, even if negated by ""I don't want to."" The ""but"" implies that despite not wanting to, the thought is present due to the overwhelming circumstances.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with indicators of severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair: ""literally nothing going for me,"" ""pushed all my friends away,"" ""barely leave the house anymore,"" ""sick of sitting inside all day,"" ""sick of _this_ life,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""so stagnant,"" ""world rejects me at every turn,"" ""don't know what's next for me,"" ""walls are closing in and there's no escape.""

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I don't want to kill myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not a direct *desire* to die, but the phrase ""I don't want to kill myself, but..."" followed by profound despair and feeling ""no escape"" strongly suggests that suicidal thoughts are present and being contended with, even if the desire is being resisted. The explicit mention of ""kill myself"" moves it beyond a mere 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is not applicable.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and future anxieties (""nothing is going to change,"" ""don't know what's next for me"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned, which goes beyond a vague feeling or general dissatisfaction. The rule states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'.""
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains an explicit mention of ""kill myself"" (even if negated by ""I don't want to,"" the ""but"" and the subsequent intense despair indicate the thought is present). There are strong expressions of hopelessness and feeling trapped (""walls are closing in and there's no escape,"" ""nothing is going to change""), which align with suicidal thoughts, even if a direct desire to die is not stated. The presence of the *thought* of suicide, without a plan, fits the 'Ideation' definition.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out as there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempts are described.

    The explicit mention of ""kill myself"" combined with profound despair and a sense of being trapped, even while stating a resistance to the idea, points to the presence of suicidal thoughts. This aligns best with 'Ideation'.

No. While a timeframe (""tomorrow"") and circumstances (""while my mom is out with family"") are mentioned, a concrete method (e.g., ""I will jump from a bridge"", ""I will take pills"") is absent. ""Try and go out"" is ambiguous and doesn't specify a method of self-harm or suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The idea of ""hitting up everyone"" could be seen as a form of preparing for a final farewell, but it's not a preparation for the *act* of suicide itself (like acquiring means, writing a note).
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by)."" None of these specific elements are present. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I probably will hit up everyone"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to die.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself""). It indicates a timeframe and a potential pre-death activity, but it *lacks a specific method or concrete preparations for the act of suicide itself*. The criteria for 'Behavior' (specific method, tools, locations for the act) are not met. Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

154,my good days make me realize how useless life is. after having a huge depressive episode I've been having what I'd consider 'good' days for the past couple days. nothing bad has happened to me. everything has been good. and I'm still dead inside. still sad. still anhedonic. I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""dead inside"" indicates emotional numbness, not literal death. However, ""yeet myself"" is a strong colloquial expression indicating a desire for self-harm or suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""useless life,"" ""huge depressive episode,"" ""still sad,"" ""still anhedonic,"" ""beyond saving,"" ""want to cry."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""yeet myself"" implies an action, but it is not a specific method (e.g., ""jump off a bridge,"" ""take pills"") nor are there any signs of preparation. It's a vague desire for self-harm/ending life.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""yeet myself"" is a direct, albeit colloquial, expression of wanting to end one's life or engage in severe self-harm. The overall sentiment of ""useless life"" and ""beyond saving"" also points to a desire not to be alive. This goes beyond vague distress.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""yeet myself"" is a general desire for action, not a specific method or plan (e.g., ""how"" or ""where"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there is no specific method or preparation, it does not fit the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current intentions/feelings (""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** The phrase ""yeet myself"" is a direct expression of a desire for self-harm/ending life, which is more explicit than general distress or vague feelings about death.
    *   **Not Behavior:** While there is a desire for action (""yeet myself""), there is no *specific plan* (method, location, means) mentioned. The definition of 'Behavior' requires explicit planning.
    *   **Not Attempt:** There is no description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Fits Ideation:** The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" as evidenced by ""yeet myself,"" but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I tried to end it once before."" (explicit reference to a past suicide attempt). ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded."" (a current wish related to the past attempt).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""i fucked up this time,"" ""God im such a fucking loser,"" ""could really use someone to talk too,"" ""All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all."" (hopelessness, despair, self-blame, isolation).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for the present or future.
    *   References to past attempts: ""I tried to end it once before."" This is a direct and explicit statement of a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""I tried to end it once before,"" which is a clear euphemism for a suicide attempt.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" implies a desire that the past attempt had been successful, which is a form of expressing a desire not to be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current or future intent.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I tried to end it once before"" refers to a past event. ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" refers to a current feeling about that past event. The rest of the post describes current distress and potential future negative consequences (""might lose my license,"" ""might have to move back home"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I tried to end it once before.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""I tried to end it once before."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide."" The definition also clarifies, ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The phrase ""tried to end it"" implies such a concrete action.
    *   While there are expressions of current distress and a wish related to the past attempt, the defining characteristic for classification here is the explicit mention of a *past suicide attempt*.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly referenced (a past attempt).
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because it describes a past action, not just thoughts or a desire to die without a plan.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because it does not describe a *current* plan or self-harming behavior. The ""tried to end it"" is a past action, not a current plan.
    *   Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""dying."" However, phrases like ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" strongly imply a desire to end one's life or current suffering, which is a form of suicidal ideation. ""Never be out of this torture cycle"" reinforces the desire for an end.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""brain is screaming at me to give up,"" ""defeated,"" ""torture cycle."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Why keep going?"" is a direct rhetorical question expressing a desire to not continue living. ""Give up and just get it over with"" in this context also conveys a strong desire to end one's life to escape the ""torture cycle."" These are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer, even without using the specific word ""suicide"" or ""die."" The 'Ideation' definition states ""i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which these phrases clearly convey.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the *intent* and *desire* to not be alive are clearly expressed through the phrases ""why keep going?"" and ""give up and just get it over with."" This is more than just general dissatisfaction or vague feelings; it's a direct questioning of continuing to live. Therefore, it's not ""unclear"" in terms of the underlying desire.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions and feelings (""Now my brain is screaming,"" ""I'll never be out of this,"" ""why keep going?"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** The post goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death. It contains explicit expressions of a desire to not continue living (""why keep going?"", ""give up and just get it over with""), which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   **Not Behavior:** There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or self-harming behavior.
    *   **Not Attempt:** There is no description of a past suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""Please help,"" ""really annoyed,"" ""feel stupid,"" ""crying about it,"" ""gets offended over everything."" These indicate distress, frustration, and low self-worth.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" directly expresses this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly states ""suicidal thoughts,"" which means it's not an 'Indicator' (which requires no explicit mention of suicide).
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it's not 'Behavior'. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""planning to commit suicide"", ""have to go"", ""end it"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""genuinely upset"", ""won't ever be the same again"", ""can't change my circumstances"", ""never be happy"", ""angry"", ""miserable"", ""sad"", ""no choice"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post states ""planning to commit suicide"" but does not provide any details about a specific method (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations. It expresses the *intention* to plan or the *decision* that this is the path, rather than an actual, concrete plan. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". This is absent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""planning to commit suicide"", ""have to go"", ""end it""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to end life.
   - Not 'Behavior' because, despite the phrase ""planning to commit suicide"", no specific plan, method, or preparation is detailed. The definition for 'Behavior' requires explicit planning like a specific method or preparations. When unsure about explicit planning, the rule is to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.
   - Not 'Attempt' as no past attempts are described.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

   - Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it"", ""the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity"", ""Its excruciating"" - These indicate severe distress, pain, and frustration, but not a desire to die.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The desire to ""scream and break everything"" relates to expressing pain, not a suicide plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""kill myself"" is used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"", which is a direct *denial* of wanting to die or commit suicide. The distress is expressed as wanting to scream and break things, not to end life.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that there is *no* desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings of overwhelming pain and distress.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses extreme emotional pain and distress (""I cant take it"", ""Its excruciating"").
   - Crucially, it explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"", which is a direct negation of suicidal intent.
   - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - While the word ""suicide"" (via ""kill myself"") is mentioned, it is used to *deny* the action, not to express a thought or desire. The post focuses on the pain and a desire to externalize it (""scream and break everything""), not a desire to end life. This fits the 'Indicator' category as it describes general distress without explicit suicidal ideation.
   - It does not meet 'Ideation' because there is no ""desire to not be alive any longer"".
   - It does not meet 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there is no plan, self-harm, or past attempt described.

    *   References to past attempts: ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"". This describes a past thought or intent that was not acted upon due to lack of means, meaning a concrete action did not occur.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned multiple times (""suicide with me"", ""can anyone suicide with me together"", ""want to suicide too"").
   - Emotional indicators: The post indicates a strong desire to die and a search for others with similar intentions, suggesting despair or hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method (e.g., how, where, with what), or preparation is mentioned. It's an open invitation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, clearly and repeatedly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""suicide with me"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan, only a desire and an invitation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""suicide with me"", ""can anyone suicide with me together"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The post is an invitation, not a detailed plan of action.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""suicide with me"") but lacks any specific plan or method.

166,"I want to kms but nothing is ready and I'm scared for some reason. Hello. I just got home from work and I really want to hang myself right now. I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly mentions ""want to kms"", ""kill myself"", ""hang myself"", ""killing myself"". Describes putting ""the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared"", ""can't stop thinking"", ""can't focus on anything except trying again"", ""deserve"", ""burden"", ""grasping at straws"". Shows high distress, hopelessness, and internal conflict.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method is mentioned: ""hang myself"" using ""the rope"". A concrete action/preparation is described: ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"". Although the user states ""nothing is ready"" regarding long-term preparations (packing, resigning), the immediate action with the rope is a direct preparation for the stated method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past *completed* attempts are described. The ""practice hung"" is a current/very recent behavior, not a past failed attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""kms"", ""kill myself"", ""hang myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I really want to hang myself right now."", ""I can't stop thinking about killing myself."", ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"" using ""rope"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"" is a clear sign of preparation and a concrete step towards the method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current intentions and very recent actions (""I really want to hang myself right now"", ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung"", ""can't focus on anything except trying again"", ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts; it specifies a method (""hang myself"") and describes a concrete, physical action taken towards that method (""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung""). This constitutes ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)"" and ""preparations taken"" as per the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   It does not describe a past *completed* attempt, but rather current/very recent preparatory behavior, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific method, and concrete preparatory actions.

I finally got confirmation that my fiancé doesn't really care. It's finally fucking time. I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun. I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead. Then he will survive, then he won't need to work out a way to keep two people afloat with only his job. He'll only need to focus on himself and I'll finally be at peace. I told him today. I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job.

I don't want to be here any more.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains numerous explicit mentions: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I'm finally ready to do it,"" ""It's finally fucking time,"" ""This job has been making me violently suicidal,"" ""I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more,"" and ""my suicidal ideation.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong emotional distress is evident: ""sobbing for the last few hours,"" ""so fucking overwhelmed,"" ""I'm done being told how terrible,"" ""I'm a fucking failure,"" ""couldn't stop crying,"" ""couldn't breathe,"" ""sounded disappointed,"" ""didn't even fucking care.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun. I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it."" While a method (gun) is *mentioned as a thought*, the explicit statements ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it"" and ""I don't know though"" indicate a lack of a *specific, concrete plan* or active preparation. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring the gun, writing a note, going to a specific location).
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""my suicidal ideation"" in the past, but this refers to past thoughts, not a past *attempt* (a concrete action). The focus is on current intent.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""violently suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I just want to fucking die"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more,"" ""at least I'll be dead"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? A method (gun) is mentioned as a *thought* or *consideration*, but not as a *specific plan* that the person is actively pursuing or has decided upon. The uncertainty (""I don't know how exactly,"" ""I don't know though"") is key.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The post explicitly states uncertainty about *how* to do it. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post primarily discusses current and future intentions (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I'm finally ready to do it"").
    *   No past attempts are described; only past ""suicidal ideation"" is mentioned, which is not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive. While a method (gun) is mentioned, the explicit uncertainty about *how* to do it (""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it,"" ""I don't know though"") means there is no *specific plan*. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The rule to lean towards 'ideation' if unsure about explicit planning is critical.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no *specific plan* or *preparations taken*. The mention of a gun is a consideration, not a concrete plan of action.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past suicide attempt is described.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""doesn't want me dead"", ""full intentions to end things"", ""at the edge"". ""End things"" in this context clearly refers to ending life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""apathetic about my existing"", ""want to sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"", ""pathetic?"". These indicate despair, hopelessness, and a desire for escape.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"". The act of driving to a specific location (mountains) with the intent to ""end things"" constitutes a preparation and a step towards a plan. The mountains serve as a ""suitable location"" as per the 'Behavior' definition.
   - References to past attempts: The post describes a recent action (""I just finished driving up..."") that was impulsive and not completed (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). It's a behavioral step towards an attempt, not a past completed attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""full intentions to end things"" and ""at the edge"" in the context of driving to a specific location.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""full intentions to end things"" directly expresses a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The location ""mountains"" is mentioned as a place chosen with ""full intentions to end things,"" implying a method (e.g., jumping).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" is a clear sign of preparation and taking a concrete step towards a plan. This is a behavioral action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent past action (""I just finished driving up..."") that was undertaken with current/immediate intentions (""full intentions to end things""). The subsequent statement ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" indicates a current wavering, but the behavioral step already occurred.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, this is not a description of a completed past attempt. It's a description of a behavioral action taken towards a potential suicide, which was then paused.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""full intentions to end things""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by describing a concrete action taken towards a plan: ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This is a ""preparation taken"" and involves a ""suitable location"" as described in the 'Behavior' definition.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because the action was not completed (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). An 'Attempt' requires a concrete, completed action in the past.

Based on the analysis, the post describes explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a concrete behavioral step (driving to a specific location with intent) towards a plan, even if the plan was not fully executed. This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm ready to die"", ""go out the way I want"", ""ready to go"". These are direct expressions of a desire to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Fuck this world"", ""nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life."" (Hopelessness, despair, anger).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""The date was set a while ago. I even changed it"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"". These phrases strongly indicate a concrete plan and active preparations, even if the specific method isn't detailed. Setting a date and making ""preps"" are explicit signs of planning. ""Strapped in and ready to go"" suggests a state of readiness for imminent action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""I'm ready to die"" and ""go out the way I want"" are direct and unambiguous expressions of wanting to end one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to die"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., gun, pills, jump) is named.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, absolutely. ""The date was set a while ago"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", and ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" are all clear indicators of preparation and a fixed plan. The 'Behavior' definition includes ""preparations taken"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm ready to die"", ""Preps being made"", ""ready to go"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die and clear signs of planning/preparation.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While no *specific method* is named, the post clearly describes *planning* and *preparations* (""date was set"", ""Preps being made"", ""strapped in and ready to go""). The definition of 'Ideation' states ""without any specific plan"", and the definition of 'Behavior' explicitly includes ""preparations taken"".
    *   **Behavior:** This is the best fit. The post expresses a clear desire to die and, critically, mentions concrete steps of planning and preparation (""date was set"", ""Preps being made"", ""strapped in and ready to go""). This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The ""preparations taken"" aspect is strongly present.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past action or attempt is described.

I still sleep in class but my teachers now dont care much which i guess is good.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Im thinking of ending my life."" This is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hate my course"", ""panic attack"", ""depression"", ""angsty"", ""friends have all pretty much ditched me"", ""loner"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and social isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Im thinking of ending my life.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Im thinking of ending my life.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - ""Im thinking of ending my life"" refers to current suicidal ideation. The rest of the post describes past struggles (OCD, grades, school, friends) that contribute to the current state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""ending my life,"" which means it's not 'Indicator'.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""Im thinking of ending my life"") without any specific plan, which perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up"" are direct expressions of a desire to die or not be alive. ""its working!"" suggests an action related to this desire is in progress.
   - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""its working!"" implies a method is being used, but the specific method, tools, location, or preparations are not identified or described.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up"" are direct expressions of wanting to die/not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., overdose, specific weapon, location) is mentioned. ""its working!"" indicates an action is in progress, but the *details* of the method are absent.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (like notes, acquiring means, specific location) are mentioned.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The post implies an action (""its working!"") but does not *identify* a specific plan or method as required for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)""). Therefore, per the rule, I lean towards 'ideation'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""hopefully this is my last post"", ""pls let me never wake up"") and an ongoing current action (""its working!"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - Not 'Behavior' because while an action is implied (""its working!""), no *specific* plan, method, or preparation is identified. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The post lacks this specificity. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it refers to current/ongoing intentions/actions, not a past completed attempt.
   - This fits 'Ideation' which is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The desire to not be alive is clear, and while an action is implied, a *specific* plan is not identified.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""im gonna do it"", ""im so ready to die"", ""tonight im gonna do it"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""i feel like im always posting here, saying im gonna do it but then i never do"", ""this doesn't make sense, im really out of it"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i have 42 unnamed pills"", ""i also have some allergy medicine"", ""they're really small so its easy to swallow"", ""this time i actually have the means to"", ""tonight im gonna do it"". This clearly indicates a specific method (pills) and a timeframe/intent to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""tonight im gonna do it""). The past reference (""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"") clarifies that previous instances were not actual attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""im so ready to die"", ""im gonna do it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning specific means (""42 unnamed pills"", ""allergy medicine"") and a clear intent to act (""tonight im gonna do it"", ""i actually have the means to""). This fits the definition of having a plan/method. This rules out 'Ideation'.
   - It does not describe a *past completed action* of a suicide attempt. The user explicitly states ""but then i never do"" regarding past threats. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific method (pills), and a stated intent to act (""tonight im gonna do it"") aligns perfectly with the 'Behavior' definition.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""More and more often it feels like the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself"" explicitly mentions ""kill myself."" Other phrases like ""I want to be done"" and ""I just want to be done with everything"" also indicate a desire to end suffering/existence.
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired,"" ""alone,"" ""struggled with mental illness,"" ""don't feel like anyone loves me or even likes me,"" ""very lonely,"" ""unwanted nuisance,"" ""anxious."" These show significant distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" is a direct and explicit mention.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to be done,"" ""I just want to be done with everything,"" and the explicit ""kill myself"" as the ""only way.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. There is no mention of tools, locations, substances, or any specific way to ""kill myself.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current feelings and a potential future intention (""More and more often it feels like the only way... would be to just be done and kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and a desire to end life (""I want to be done""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. This means it does not fit the 'Behavior' category.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This perfectly matches the post's content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post repeatedly uses the phrase ""check out"" as a euphemism for dying/ending life (""I really want to check out"", ""how much I want to check out"", ""unexpectedly checking out"", ""go out this way"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""im going to do it"" in the context of extreme pain and hopelessness (""i cant do this anymore"", ""im done"") strongly implies an intent to end their life. ""Im done"" further reinforces this.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i cant do this anymore"", ""im in so much pain"", ""i cant handle it anymore"", ""i cant. i cant."", ""im done"" all indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., ""jump"", ""pills"", ""gun"") or preparations (e.g., ""note"", ""acquiring means"") are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""im going to do it"" is a direct and explicit expression of intent to end their life, going beyond vague feelings or general dissatisfaction. It clearly conveys a desire to not be alive any longer and an intent to act on that desire. This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post expresses intent (""im going to do it"") but lacks any details about *how* they plan to do it. According to the rules, if uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""im going to do it"" refers to a current or immediate future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** The post contains explicit expressions of intent to end life (""im going to do it"", ""im done"") which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
    *   **Not Behavior:** There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The phrase ""im going to do it"" expresses intent but lacks the concrete details required for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Not Attempt:** The post describes current/future intent, not a past completed action.
    *   **Fits Ideation:** The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""im going to do it"", ""im done"") but without any specific plan or method.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" (explicit).
   - Emotional indicators: ""stupid,"" ""lot of stress,"" ""easier,"" ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life,"" ""why not."" (Indicates hopelessness, despair, feeling overwhelmed).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is *asking* for a ""mostly painless way to kill myself,"" which indicates a search for a method, but not a specific method or plan *stated* by the user as their own. No preparations are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""why not.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user is inquiring about methods, not stating a specific one they intend to use.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The user is seeking information about methods, which is a step towards planning, but they have not articulated a specific plan or taken any preparatory actions. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" This post fits the ""without any specific plan"" part of the 'Ideation' definition.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to end life.
   - Not 'Attempt' because there is no mention of a past action.
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""it would just be a lot easier"") but does not state a specific plan or method the user intends to use.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""die,"" ""end it with pills,"" and describes the physical process of dying from an overdose.
    *   Emotional indicators: The post does not convey the author's personal distress, hopelessness, or despair. Instead, it's a cautionary and informative tone, aiming to deter others from suicide by overdose.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: It discusses ""pills"" and ""overdosing"" as a method, but it describes the *consequences* of this method for a hypothetical person, not the author's own plan or preparation.
    *   References to past attempts: There are no references to the author's past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used, and the concept of ending one's life via overdose is central.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The author is explicitly *warning against* suicide by overdose (""Don't take the pills""). The post's purpose is to dissuade, not to express the author's own desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills"" and ""overdosing.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not by the author. The post describes the *consequences* of such an action by *someone else*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to the *potential future consequences* of an action (overdosing) for *someone else*, not the author's own past or current/future intentions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The crucial rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   The author of this post is clearly not expressing their own suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts. They are providing a detailed warning about the dangers and unpleasantness of overdose as a method of suicide.
    *   Let's review the definitions:
        *   **Attempt:** No past attempt by the author is described.
        *   **Behavior:** The author is not expressing suicidal thoughts or a plan.
        *   **Ideation:** The author is not expressing suicidal thoughts or feelings (a desire to not be alive).
        *   **Indicator:** While the post *does* explicitly mention suicide as a topic, the definition of 'Indicator' also states, ""but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This perfectly describes the author's stance. The author is discussing suicide, but not expressing *their own* suicidal ideation or intent. Therefore, for the author, there is no direct indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. This is the lowest risk category and the only one that fits a post where the author is discussing suicide as a topic without expressing personal risk.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"" strongly implies suicide, especially coupled with ""no motivation to keep on living"" and ""ill do it when im fed up of this.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""no motivation to keep on living,"" ""fed up of this.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The user explicitly states ""im not ready.""
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the strong implication of ""im positive im gonna do it"" in the context of not wanting to live.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no motivation to keep on living.""
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear enough to be 'ideation'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no plan mentioned.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions (""gonna do it the the future,"" ""ill do it when im fed up of this"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post expresses a clear desire to end life (""no motivation to keep on living,"" ""im positive im gonna do it"") but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation'. It is not 'indicator' because suicidal thoughts are explicit. It is not 'behavior' because there is no plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""fucking hate"", ""psychologically tortured"", ""couldn't even find the time to care"". These indicate significant distress, anger, and feelings of neglect and suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and past experiences (""having me"", ""resulted in a human being living a life psychologically tortured""). There are no current or future intentions of self-harm or suicide mentioned.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses extreme dissatisfaction and emotional pain but does not contain any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or any plans. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This aligns perfectly with the 'Indicator' category. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (no explicit desire to not be alive), 'Behavior' (no plan or self-harm), or 'Attempt' (no past attempt described).

There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post describes a dream involving ""mass murdering people"" and ""slicing up as many people as they could."" This describes violence and death, but it is explicitly stated as a dream and the violence is perpetrated by ""foreign men"" on ""people,"" not by the poster on themselves. There are no mentions of the poster wanting to die, suicide, or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses ""severe panic attack,"" ""absolutely terrified me,"" ""sheer panic,"" ""absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake,"" and ""anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense."" These are clear indicators of distress, fear, and anxiety.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None related to suicide or self-harm by the poster. The plans/methods mentioned (slicing, breaking in) are part of the dream's narrative, not actions or intentions of the poster.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
    *   The post focuses on the fear and anxiety caused by a vivid dream, not on any desire to end one's own life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not in relation to the poster's own actions or intentions regarding suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a past dream (""Dreamt of..."") and the current emotional impact and anxiety (""I woke up to a severe panic attack,"" ""anxious to sleep""). There are no current or future intentions of suicide or self-harm.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly indicates significant distress, panic, and anxiety.
    *   However, it completely lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide, a desire to not be alive, or any suicidal thoughts or feelings. The violence described is external to the poster and occurs within a dream.
    *   Based on the definitions, the post fits the 'Indicator' category: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   ""what comes after. i just need something to believe in so i can do it."" - Indicates a desire to end life (""do it"") contingent on a belief in an afterlife. This points to suicidal ideation.
    *   ""i don't want to believe theres nothing."" - Reinforces the above.
    *   ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" - This is a direct and explicit mention of past suicide attempts. ""Once on purpose"" confirms a deliberate past action.
    *   ""all i saw was fear and despair."" - Describes the experience of the past attempts.
    *   ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" - Expresses a current desire to end suffering, which in context, implies ending life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the description of past ""overdosed... on purpose"" and the desire to ""do it"" and ""end this suffering.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No *current* specific plan or method is mentioned for a *future* action. The post asks for a *reason* and *strength* to ""do it,"" implying a desire but no concrete current plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" - This clearly refers to *past* events/actions.
    *   ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it."" and ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" - These refer to *current* suicidal ideation and a desire to act, but not a concrete current plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a clear and explicit description of *past suicide attempts* (""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"").
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'. Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   Even though there is current ideation, the explicit mention of past concrete actions (overdosing) aligns perfectly with the 'Attempt' definition, especially the note about labeling as 'attempt' even if current plans (or in this case, strong ideation/desire) are also present.

   - Emotional indicators: ""I thought I was getting better,"" ""bad days,"" ""I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood,"" ""scared to stress him even more.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The mention of running out of meds is a contributing factor to distress, not a plan for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""I'm suicidal again"" indicates a past *state* of being suicidal, but not a past *attempt*. The focus is on the current feeling.

   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. The ""again"" refers to the recurrence of suicidal ideation, not a past action.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide by hanging"", ""tied the noose"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""im still not sure"", ""i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest"" - indicates ambivalence, distress, seeking information about the act.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""suicide by hanging"" (method), ""ive alr tied the noose"" (preparation).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide by hanging"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the act of tying the noose and asking about the experience of hanging strongly implies a current intent or contemplation of ending life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""ive alr tied the noose"" is a concrete step of preparation involving a specific means (noose/rope).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Is suicide by hanging..."", ""ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond just expressing a desire to not be alive (Ideation) by mentioning a specific method (""hanging"") and a concrete preparation step (""tied the noose"").
   - The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ...tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life...)"". Tying a noose fits this description perfectly as a preparation using a suitable tool.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions (""i just wanna end it"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** This category is for posts lacking explicit expression concerning suicide. ""i just wanna end it"" is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings, so it's not an 'indicator'.
   - **Ideation:** This category includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" perfectly fits the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" aspect, and there is no specific plan mentioned.
   - **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan or self-harming behavior. Neither is present.
   - **Attempt:** This category describes past attempts. No past attempt is described.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to end their life without a specific plan, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

187,"Consider going hobo. Hi people. I just want to point out the alternative for anyone on the brink of suicide. There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant. Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""anyone on the brink of suicide"" and the author's past experience of feeling like they ""couldn't cope"" and being ""on the brink of suicide.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""felt like I couldn't cope,"" ""better than the predicaments that preceded it.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans for suicide are mentioned. The post describes an *alternative* to suicide (going hobo/vagrant).
    *   References to past attempts: The post describes past situations where the author was ""on the brink of suicide"" but *chose an alternative* (going vagrant) instead of attempting suicide. It explicitly states ""the road has saved me in the past"" *from* suicidal feelings. No actual suicide attempt is described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""anyone on the brink of suicide"" and the author's past state of being ""on the brink of suicide.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The author describes past feelings of being ""on the brink of suicide"" and not being able to ""cope,"" which implies a past desire to not be alive. The post itself is a reflection on these past feelings.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for suicide. The methods described are for the alternative lifestyle (living in squats, begging, etc.).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to past events (""There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope,"" ""the road has saved me in the past""). The author explicitly states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment."" It also mentions the alternative being there ""should I ever need it again,"" which is a future contingency for avoiding suicide.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, past *avoidance* of attempts by choosing an alternative is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for posts lacking *any* explicit expression concerning suicide. This post *does* explicitly mention suicide (""on the brink of suicide"") and describes the author's past suicidal thoughts. Therefore, it is not an 'indicator'.
    *   **Ideation:** This category applies when ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post *describes* the author's past explicit suicidal thoughts (""on the brink of suicide,"" ""felt like I couldn't cope""). While these are past, the *content* of the post explicitly includes these expressions. There is no specific plan mentioned. This fits the definition better than 'indicator' because of the explicit mention of past suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan or self-harm. Neither is present.
    *   **Attempt:** This category requires a description of a past suicide attempt. The post describes choosing an *alternative* to suicide, not an attempt.

Given that the post explicitly discusses past suicidal thoughts and feelings (""on the brink of suicide""), it goes beyond a mere 'indicator' despite the author currently being ""functional."" The content *contains* explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, even if historical.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""end it"" is used, which in this context, following ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""fucked up my life,"" strongly implies ending one's life. ""I can't go on anymore"" also indicates a desire to cease living.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worse"", ""addiction"", ""drunk"", ""lonely"", ""fucked up my life"", ""miss outside"", ""miss being happy"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"". This indicates a temporal plan (""tonight"") and a specific state (""drunk"") that precedes the act of ""ending it."" While the exact *mechanism* of ending it isn't detailed, the mention of being drunk as a precursor for an act planned for ""tonight"" suggests a method or preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""end it"" are direct expressions of wanting to cease living.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear. ""End it"" in this context is a clear expression of suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, being ""drunk"" is mentioned as part of the sequence leading to ""end it tonight."" This can be interpreted as a method (e.g., overdose on alcohol, or using alcohol to lower inhibitions for another method) or a preparation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Being ""drunk in my basement"" and stating ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" indicates a sequence of actions and a setting, which constitutes preparation and a time-bound plan.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': I am not uncertain. The post clearly outlines a plan for ""tonight"" involving a specific state (""drunk"") leading to the act of ""ending it."" This goes beyond mere thoughts and into a concrete, immediate plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""tonight I'm just gonna... then end it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to end life (""end it,"" ""can't go on anymore"").
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post includes not just explicit suicidal thoughts but also a clear, time-bound plan (""tonight"") involving a specific state/preparation (""drunk"") leading to the act.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a plan (""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it""). The mention of being drunk as a precursor to ""ending it"" and the specific timeframe (""tonight"") constitutes a form of explicit planning or preparation for an imminent act.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past attempts are described.

The presence of a specific timeframe (""tonight"") and a described action/state (""just gonna be drunk"") leading directly to the act of ""ending it"" moves this beyond mere ideation into the realm of planned behavior.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""successfully end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: The question implies a serious consideration of ending life, suggesting despair or hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" This specifies the substances intended to be used as a method. ""I have"" indicates possession/preparation. The question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" is an inquiry about the efficacy of this specific method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""successfully end my life.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" implies this desire and intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" These are specific substances.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have 800mg codeine"" indicates the means are acquired and available. The question about efficacy further confirms consideration of using these specific means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The question is about a potential future action using currently available means.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a specific method is identified.
   - Not 'Ideation' because specific methods (""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"") are mentioned, moving it beyond just thoughts or feelings. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a current consideration/plan, not a past completed action.
   - This post explicitly states a desire to end life and identifies specific means (""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"") that are possessed (""I have"") and being considered for use, fitting the definition of 'Behavior' which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs).""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""why should i live"", ""resisting the desire to end"", ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"", ""i cant live like this for the rest of my life"", ""i cant stand being here any other moment"", ""i cant imagine myself living another year this way"". These are strong expressions of not wanting to continue living.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""failed everything"", ""wasted it"", ""fucking cant do this anymore"", ""im not happy or enjoying anything"", ""nobody fucking understands me and tries to help"", ""nobody knows how i suffer everyday"", ""why me"", ""what did i do to suffer"", ""never been happy since birth"". These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. Phrases like ""why should i live"", ""resisting the desire to end"", and ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive or to end one's life. The definition of Ideation includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** The expressions are sufficiently clear to indicate a desire to not be alive, moving it beyond a general 'indicator'. ""Resisting the desire to end"" is a very strong indicator of suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** There is no planning mentioned, so it does not fit 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post primarily expresses current feelings and future intentions/lack thereof (""why should i live"", ""everyday i ran out of reasons"", ""i cant do this anymore"", ""i cant stand being here any other moment"", ""i cant imagine myself living another year""). While there's a mention of past unhappiness (""never been happy since birth""), the core of the post is about current and future desire to not live.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""why should i live"", ""resisting the desire to end"", ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive""). This aligns with the ""Ideation"" definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   Crucially, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from ""Behavior"".
    *   There is no description of a past attempt, ruling out ""Attempt"".
    *   The expressions are too direct and explicit about not wanting to live to be classified as a mere ""Indicator"" (which ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" or ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings"").

191,SMI. How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""commit suicide eventually"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The question ""How do you tell the people you love..."" suggests a heavy, perhaps desperate, internal state and a contemplation of a future suicidal act.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. The post is about the communication of a thought, not the execution of a plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""commit suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" is a direct expression of a strong, albeit future-oriented, suicidal thought or belief about one's own fate.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""will probably commit suicide eventually"" clearly refers to a future intention/probability, not a past event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It explicitly mentions suicide, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It expresses a strong suicidal thought/belief about a future action (""you will probably commit suicide eventually""), fitting the 'Ideation' definition of ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life"".
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""just end myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation, even if attributed to voices.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post describes suicidal thoughts but no concrete plan or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"" refers to current and ongoing suicidal thoughts/intentions. The financial mistakes are past, but their impact and the resulting suicidal thoughts are current.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""end myself,"" which rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts (""voices telling me to just end myself"") but no specific plan, method, or preparation. This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains the phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"". This directly references the concept of the user's own death.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""abusive ex"", ""mental health stuff"", ""not okay right now"" indicate distress. ""hopeful thought"", ""i hope i can have that one day"", ""i can be okay"" indicate hope and a desire for improvement.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. The word ""die"" is used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" implies that the thought of dying was present as a consideration, but the current sentiment is a hopeful shift *away* from that idea. It is not an expression of a *desire* to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:** No specific methods or preparations are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:** The post refers to current feelings (""not okay right now"") and future hopes (""hope I can have that one day""). It does not describe past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Behavior or Attempt:** There are no plans, self-harm, or past attempts described.
    *   **Between Indicator and Ideation:**
        *   The post expresses distress and mental health struggles.
        *   The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" is the key. While it acknowledges the *idea* of dying was present, it does *not* express a *desire* to die or to not be alive. In fact, it expresses a hopeful thought *against* dying.
        *   The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
        *   Since the post does not express a ""desire to not be alive any longer"" and instead expresses a hope *not* to die, it aligns with the condition for 'Indicator'.
        *   Additionally, the rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" applies, as ""die"" is not ""suicide"" and the desire is absent.
        *   The post describes general distress and a hopeful outlook, with a reflection on the concept of dying that ultimately rejects it as a current desire.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i dont wanna die rn"", ""suicidal thoughts are always there"", ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"". The user explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and asks about the lethality of a substance.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""i just wanna be calm rn because im bored and when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there."" Indicates distress and a coping mechanism (taking pills for calmness) related to the presence of suicidal thoughts.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taking 3 xanax pills"". The user states ""i will do it anyway"" in reference to taking the pills, but the stated purpose is ""to be calm"", not explicitly to die. The question ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" is a query about the method's lethality, not a direct statement of intent to use it for suicide.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts are always there"". The question ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" also directly relates to dying from an action, in the context of suicidal thoughts.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The user states ""i dont wanna die rn"", which is a negation, but the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" clearly indicates suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""3 xanax pills"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The user states ""i will do it anyway"" regarding taking the pills.
    *   The crucial point is whether there is an *explicit plan to commit suicide*. The user states they will take the pills to ""be calm"". While they ask about dying from the pills and have suicidal thoughts, the post does not explicitly state a plan to use the pills *to commit suicide*. The question about dying is a query about a potential outcome, not a declaration of intent for that outcome. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" is highly relevant here. The intent to die from the pills is not explicitly stated as a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current thoughts (""suicidal thoughts are always there"") and future actions (""i will do it anyway"" regarding taking pills), not past events.
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide/suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"". It also mentions a specific method (Xanax pills) and asks about its lethality. However, the stated intent for taking the pills is ""to be calm"", not explicitly to commit suicide. The question about dying is a query, not a statement of a plan to die. Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", this fits Ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** While a method is mentioned, and the user has suicidal thoughts, there is no *explicit plan to commit suicide* stated. The user's stated intent for taking the pills is calmness, and the question about dying is a query. This does not meet the ""explicit plan to commit suicide"" requirement for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes current thoughts and potential future actions, not past attempts.

Based on the analysis, particularly the emphasis on explicit planning for 'Behavior' and the ""when in doubt"" rule, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" which is a direct mention of self-harm and a query for a method. It also states ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself,"" which is an explicit mention of suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""shitface,"" ""fucking monster,"" ""piece of human garbage,"" ""hurt my friend,"" ""don't know what to do."" These indicate strong feelings of guilt, self-loathing, despair, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The query ""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" is a direct request for a method/location for self-harm. While not a full, detailed plan, it is a step towards planning or exhibiting self-harming behavior. The ""kill myself"" statement is conditional and lacks a specific method, but the self-harm query is more concrete.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I will wait until I can kill myself"" (conditional desire to end life).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? For self-harm, yes, by asking for ""places on the body"" to do it without notice, which implies seeking a specific method/location. For suicide, no specific method is mentioned, but the self-harm query is a strong indicator of behavioral intent.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation, but seeking information on *how* to self-harm is a step towards preparation/behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current intentions (""does anyone know..."") and future, conditional intentions (""I will wait until I can kill myself"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""self harmed,"" ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   The phrase ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" goes beyond mere suicidal *thoughts* (ideation). It is a direct query for a method or location for self-harm, which falls under the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" Seeking specific places to self-harm is a form of planning or exhibiting self-harming behavior.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Given the explicit query for self-harm methods, the classification leans towards 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation', as it indicates a step towards action or planning for self-harm.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Im probably going to kill myself soon.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""feeling a really strong urge,"" ""dont care,"" ""dont make any effort to keep me around,"" ""wish i wasn't even born,"" ""life is fucking stupid."" (Indicates hopelessness, despair, feelings of worthlessness/unwantedness).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Im probably going to kill myself soon,"" ""i just wish i wasn't even born to begin with.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""Im probably going to kill myself soon,"" ""feeling a really strong urge to lately"").
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""strong urge to lately"") and a desire not to be alive.
   - It does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., a specific tool, location, or action).
   - It is not merely general distress (ruling out 'indicator').
   - It does not describe a past attempt (ruling out 'attempt').
   - It lacks a concrete plan or self-harming behavior (ruling out 'behavior').
   - Therefore, it aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""plummet to the ground"", ""corpse"" clearly indicate a desire for death by suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""so tempted"", ""guilt or fear"" indicate a strong internal struggle and temptation towards the act.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" describes a specific method (jumping) and a specific type of location (""highest floor"").
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the act of ""plummet to the ground"" to become a ""corpse"" is an explicit description of suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" is a direct expression of a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" describes a specific method (jumping) and a suitable location type (""highest floor""). This aligns with the 'behavior' definition's examples of ""suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from)"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation, but the contemplation of ""going to the highest floor"" is part of the specific plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""so tempted to just go...""). It does not describe past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly described through the method and desired outcome.
   - It's not 'ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts/feelings and includes a specific method and location. The definition for 'ideation' states ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - It's not 'attempt' because it describes a current temptation/plan, not a past action.
   - The post explicitly describes a specific method (""plummet to the ground"") and a specific type of location (""highest floor"") for committing suicide, which fits the definition of 'behavior'. The hesitation (""if only..."") does not negate the presence of the explicit plan.

198,"If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he wont feel that bad if I kill myself. Any thoughts?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The phrase ""If I deeply hurt my boyfriend"" suggests distress and a desire to mitigate perceived negative impact on others through self-harm.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""kill myself"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post asks for ""Any thoughts?"", which indicates a thought process, not a concrete plan or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""If I... he won't feel that bad if I kill myself""). It's a hypothetical scenario leading to a potential future action.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because it refers to a potential future action, not a past attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as the post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and a desire to end one's life, but without any specific plan or method.

Trying to work up the nerve. No one has ever stopped. The last time, someone came out of the elevator looked at me and kept walking, got into their car and left. Do hospitals even have security? This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I can never get the nerve to jump,"" ""Trying to work up the nerve,"" ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped,"" ""someone took their life the same way.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, seeking help/care (""hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage,"" ""jump."" This is a specific location and method. The repeated act of going there and standing/sitting for an hour is a form of preparation/action towards the plan.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts by the *poster* are mentioned. The post refers to someone else's past suicide (""6 years ago someone took their life the same way""). The poster explicitly states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump,"" indicating no actual jump has occurred.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, by implication through the act of ""jumping"" from a ""ledge"" with the intent to ""die,"" and explicitly by mentioning ""someone took their life.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Trying to work up the nerve"" to jump, and the contemplation ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped."" The act itself implies a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage"" and the method ""jump."" This is a clear, specific method and location.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the repeated act of going to this specific location and standing/sitting there for extended periods (""Sometimes for an hour"") ""Trying to work up the nerve"" is a clear sign of preparation and engagement with the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing intentions/actions (""I'm standing,"" ""I can never get,"" ""I'll stand there,"" ""I go hoping""). It mentions a past event involving someone else, but the poster's actions are current.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide/dying is explicitly implied and discussed, and there's more than general distress.
   - Not 'Ideation' because while there are explicit suicidal thoughts, there is also a very specific plan/method (location: hospital parking garage ledge; method: jumping) and repeated engagement with this plan (standing there for an hour, trying to work up the nerve). This goes beyond just thoughts.
   - Fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""trying to work up the nerve to jump,"" ""if I wanted to die"") and clearly mentions a specific plan (""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage"") and method (""jump""). The repeated action of going to the location and attempting to gain courage constitutes a form of preparation/engagement with the plan.
   - Not 'Attempt' because the post explicitly states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump,"" indicating no actual attempt has occurred by the poster.

Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts with a specific plan and repeated actions towards that plan.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, explicitly states ""The first time I tried committing suicide"", ""I have multiple attempts on my life"", ""my death seems to ultimate answer"", and ""began searching about ways to kill myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""struggling with depression"", ""life is going absolutely shitty"", ""felt hopeless"", ""hated myself"", ""grades went to shit"", ""mentally exhausting"", ""all I caused was problems"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Past methods mentioned (""phone charger"", ""couldn't find rope""). Current activity is ""searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"", which indicates active research for a method.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, explicitly states ""The first time I tried committing suicide"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""my death seems to ultimate answer"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Past methods (phone charger, rope) are mentioned. Current methods are being actively searched for (""searching about ways to kill myself""). This is more than just ideation; it's an active step towards finding a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""searching about ways to kill myself"" can be considered a form of preparation or pre-planning activity, even if a specific method isn't chosen yet.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. Past attempts are clearly described (""The first time I tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts on my life""). Current intentions/actions are also present (""my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""recently I began searching about ways to kill myself"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly describes *past attempts* at suicide (""The first time I tried committing suicide"", ""I have multiple attempts on my life""). This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt'.
   - The 'Attempt' definition also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post mentions past attempts and also current suicidal ideation (""my death seems to ultimate answer"") and active searching for methods (""began searching about ways to kill myself"").
   - Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all, i show nothing but respect and kindness to them but they just fake everything, then when i figure it out im just more dead inside then if they just told me to stop in the first place. Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""more dead inside"" is present, but this is a metaphorical expression of emotional numbness and despair, not a literal mention of death or suicide. There are no other mentions of suicide, self-harm, or dying.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all,"" ""more dead inside,"" ""Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything."" These indicate deep sadness, betrayal, loneliness, hopelessness, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The phrase ""more dead inside"" is not an explicit mention of suicide.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. ""Im done with everything"" expresses extreme frustration and a desire to give up on current life struggles and interactions, but it is not a direct statement of wanting to die or not be alive in a suicidal context.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** It is unclear if ""done with everything"" implies a desire to die. Following the rule, I lean towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** Not applicable, as there is no planning mentioned at all.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings and a general state of being ""done"" with ongoing life situations.
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed (""done with everything""). However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or any suicidal thoughts*. The phrase ""more dead inside"" is metaphorical. According to the 'indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits the 'indicator' category perfectly as it describes general distress and hopelessness without explicitly mentioning suicide or a desire to die.

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrases ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"" strongly imply an intent to end life, which is a suicidal act, even though the word ""suicide"" isn't explicitly used.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""less scary,"" ""getting more courage,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicate a progression towards a planned action, overcoming fear.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method (""jump off"") and a specific location (""bedroom window"") are mentioned. The phrase ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicates a current intention and a desire for it to happen in the near future.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not present.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the description of jumping from a window with the intent to ""do it soon"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life. The act described is inherently suicidal.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump off"" is a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""getting more courage"" and ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicate mental preparation and an intent to act soon. A specific location (""bedroom window"") is also identified. This clearly falls under ""specific method or preparations taken"" and ""suitable locations (e.g. ...buildings to jump off from)"" as per the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, the planning is explicit: method (jumping) and location (bedroom window).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I can jump off,"" ""I'm getting more courage,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/intentions (the act of jumping to end life).
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because it includes a specific plan/method (jumping from a bedroom window). The definition of 'Ideation' explicitly states ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   It perfectly fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to jump to end life) and mentions a specific plan (method: jumping; location: bedroom window).
    *   It's not 'Attempt' as it describes current/future intentions, not a past completed action.

This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes."" This is a direct mention of an action related to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""low energy,"" ""depression hits really hard,"" ""hate talking about myself,"" ""waste their time."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and low self-worth.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""writing suicide notes"" is a clear indication of preparation for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit past *attempts* are mentioned, but the *action* of writing suicide notes is described as something that has happened in the past (""sometimes... next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the act of ""writing suicide notes.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression of wanting to die, but the act of writing suicide notes strongly implies suicidal ideation and preparation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., how they would die) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" is explicitly listed in the 'Behavior' definition as a sign of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The phrase ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" indicates a recurring past action. It's not a current, active plan *at this moment*, but it describes a past behavior that is a preparation for suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned through the act of writing notes.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because ""writing suicide notes"" goes beyond mere thoughts and into concrete preparation, which is a characteristic of 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While no *method* is stated, ""writing suicide notes"" is a *preparation*.
   - 'Behavior' fits well. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (implied by writing notes) and mentions a preparation (""suicide note""). The definition explicitly includes ""suicide note"" as a form of explicit planning or preparation. Even though it's described as something that happens when depression hits, it's a concrete action of preparation.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post describes writing notes, not a physical action taken to end one's life. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" like an overdose.

Based on the analysis, ""writing suicide notes"" is a clear sign of preparation for suicide, which falls under the 'Behavior' category.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" is a direct reference to self-harm. ""To deep"" suggests a significant or severe injury, possibly life-threatening or intended to be so.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Ah."" and ""fuck"" convey distress, pain, or frustration.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cut"" is a specific method. The post describes an action that has occurred or is occurring.
    *   References to past attempts: The phrasing ""Just cut"" implies a very recent or immediate action, not a historical, failed suicide attempt from a more distant past.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not explicitly, but the severity implied by ""to deep"" in the context of self-harm suggests a high level of distress and potential suicidal intent, even if not explicitly stated as a desire to die.
    *   Given the direct description of self-harm, it goes beyond 'indicator' or 'ideation'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the act itself is described.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" and ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide."" While it's not a future plan, it's a description of a self-harming act using a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Just cut"" indicates a very recent past event, possibly ongoing. It's not a distant past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator** is too weak as there is explicit self-harm.
    *   **Ideation** is incorrect because the post describes an action/behavior, not just thoughts or feelings.
    *   **Behavior** is defined as including ""exhibits self-harming behavior."" The post ""Just cut to deep"" directly describes such behavior. While it's a past action, it's very recent, and the primary fit is the description of self-harm.
    *   **Attempt** is for ""past attempts at suicide."" While cutting can be a suicide attempt, the phrasing ""Just cut to deep"" doesn't explicitly frame it as a *failed suicide attempt* from the past. It describes the act of self-harm itself, which fits the 'Behavior' definition more directly, especially since 'Behavior' explicitly includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior."" If it were ""I tried to kill myself by cutting last week,"" it would be 'Attempt'. But the immediacy and focus on the act itself make 'Behavior' a better fit.

    Therefore, the post describes self-harming behavior, which falls under the 'Behavior' category.

    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The user's post is a rant about others' reactions to what is presumably their suicidal ideation (given the context of ""don't do it!""), but the post itself does not contain the user's explicit statement of suicidal ideation. It expresses profound distress and anger at perceived unhelpful interventions. According to the definition, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there's no explicit ideation from the user in this post.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current feelings of frustration and anger. No past events or future suicidal intentions are explicitly stated by the user.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempts described.
    *   **Behavior:** No plan or self-harm mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The user does not explicitly state a desire to die or suicidal thoughts. While the context strongly suggests the user is experiencing suicidal ideation (due to the quoted phrases like ""don't do it!""), the user's *own words* in the post are a critique of others, not a direct expression of their own suicidal state. The definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is not present.
    *   **Indicator:** The post expresses significant distress, anger, and a feeling of being misunderstood. It is in a context related to suicide, but the user's own words do not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die. The definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This fits perfectly.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements are: ""i kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time"" (expression of desire to die, with ambivalence), ""i struggle to get up i find everything boring"" (anhedonia, low energy), ""my friends are the only thing keeping me going and i dont have many since they all left"" (social isolation, loss of support), ""i get bullied so stopped attending school i dont have good grades"" (bullying, academic issues), ""idk what i should do haha"" (helplessness, confusion). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: The phrase ""i kinda just wanna die"" is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive. While there's ambivalence (""but dont at the same time""), the desire is explicitly stated.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. No signs of preparation are present.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""i kinda just wanna die""). There is no mention of past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""i kinda just wanna die"") but does not include any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because there is an explicit desire to die. It is not 'Behavior' because there is no plan. It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now,"" ""they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time,"" ""want to justify dying,"" and ""thinking about partially planning to die."" It also mentions ""self destructive.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""guilty,"" ""anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse,"" ""feel terrible,"" ""fear I only hurt,"" ""terribly anxious nihilistic.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user states, ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips,"" but crucially, ""I've been thinking about partially planning to die."" This indicates that the act of planning is occurring, even if the plan is not fully formed or specific methods are not readily available.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""justify dying,"" ""partially planning to die.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""want to justify dying"" and the overall context of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""planning to die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (e.g., type of tool, location) are detailed. The user notes a lack of ""strong and reliable methods at my finger tips.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""thinking about partially planning to die"" is a key indicator. While it doesn't describe a *completed* plan or *acquired* means, it explicitly states that the *process of planning* is happening. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" ""Partially planning"" fits this criterion, as it's a mention of engaging in the planning process, moving beyond just the desire or thought.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post clearly describes current and ongoing thoughts and intentions: ""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now,"" ""they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time,"" ""I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide and suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past suicide attempt is described.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
        *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide.""
    *   The crucial phrase is ""thinking about partially planning to die."" This goes beyond just having suicidal thoughts or a desire to die (Ideation). The inclusion of ""planning"" indicates a cognitive step towards formulating a method or course of action, even if it's partial and not fully detailed. While specific methods aren't at hand, the *act of planning* is mentioned, which aligns with 'Behavior's requirement of mentioning ""a plan."" The post describes a process of planning, even if incomplete, rather than just a general desire to die.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""better off dead"", ""too scared to end it"", ""no reason to keep going"", and a very direct statement: ""i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself. then i can rest in peace.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness, despair, feeling of loss (""took the last bit of stability"", ""lost everything"", ""my life has always been shit"", ""ugly useless stupid girl"", ""so tired"", ""no fucking reason to keep playing this bullshit game"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, a specific method (""hang myself"") and a specific location/means of getting there (""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot"").
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears."" This refers to past *thoughts* or *fears* about ending it, not a concrete past *attempt* as per the definition of 'attempt' (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""better off dead"", ""end it"", ""hang myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""better off dead"", ""no reason to keep going"", ""then i can rest in peace.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot"" describes a specific sequence of actions to execute the plan, including a location.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The primary focus is on current distress and future intentions (""i've been thinking i could just drive out...""). Past thoughts of ending it are mentioned but not past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""better off dead"", ""no reason to keep going""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post includes a specific plan: ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This clearly describes a method (""hang myself"") and a location/preparatory actions (""drive out into the mountains and hike... find a nice little spot""). According to the definition of 'behavior', it ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suitable locations...)."" This fits perfectly.
    *   The post mentions past *thoughts* of ending it, but not a concrete past *attempt* (e.g., an overdose that happened). Therefore, 'attempt' is not the correct category.

Based on the analysis, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a specific plan (method and location) places this post firmly in the 'behavior' category.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to be dead."" and ""I don't want to live anymore."" These are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive. This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition: ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"" multiple times. It also mentions ""recovered from being suicidal"" in the context of others, highlighting the user's current struggle.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what to do anymore,"" ""it's just not working,"" ""so so so unbelievably suicidal,"" ""tired of all of it,"" ""so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""unbelievably suicidal"", ""suicidal thoughts"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the constant struggle with suicidal thoughts and feeling ""tired of all of it"" and ""don't know what else to try at this point"" implies a strong desire for the current state of suffering to end, which is a form of not wanting to continue living with these thoughts.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

   - Emotional indicators: ""fucked up self"", ""depression and anxiety"", ""scared they'll just think it's an excuse for me to be lazy"", ""literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore"", ""idk what to do"". These indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and lack of motivation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post is focused on the need for therapy and the barriers to accessing it.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a desire to ""fix my fucked up self"" through therapy, not a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current struggles (""I need therapy"", ""I can't tell them about my depression and anxiety"", ""I literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore"") and future intentions (getting therapy). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly indicates significant distress, depression, anxiety, and a lack of motivation. It expresses a strong need for help (""I need therapy more than anything else"").
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts. The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. ... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This perfectly matches the content of the post.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   Emotional indicators: ""i wish i wasn't like this :("".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""an idea of a new suicide method"" involving ""eye drops in his beverages"". This is a *specific method* being considered as an *idea*. However, there are no signs of *preparation* or a *concrete plan to execute* this method. The phrasing ""gave me an idea"" suggests it's still in the conceptual stage.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""suicide method"" are explicit.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and considering a ""suicide method"" indicates a desire to not be alive, despite the internal conflict (""i really don't want to have to do that"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""putting eye drops in his beverages"" is mentioned as an *idea* for a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring eye drops, writing a note). The post explicitly states it ""gave me an idea,"" not that they are acting on it. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" is relevant here. While a specific method is *identified*, it's presented as an *idea* rather than a concrete *plan* to execute.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are clear suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Behavior:** The post mentions a specific method (""eye drops""), but it's presented as an ""idea"" that was *given* to them, not a concrete *plan* they intend to execute or any *preparations* taken. The definition of Behavior requires ""a plan to commit suicide"" or ""preparations taken."" The post does not indicate a firm plan or preparations. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies.
    *   **Ideation:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and considers a specific ""suicide method"" as an ""idea,"" but without a clear, actionable plan or preparations.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicide note"", ""free myself of my problems"" (contextually implying ending life), ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" (contextually implying suicide).

    *   **References to past attempts:** ""A month ago I wrote a suicide note... Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself."" This describes a past event where a detailed plan was made and almost executed, but was self-interrupted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide note"" and the clear implication of ""do it this time"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""free myself of my problems"" and the desire to ""do it this time"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The post mentions ""Picked a time and place"" and writing a ""suicide note, primed and ready to be posted"". While a specific *means* (e.g., gun, pills) isn't stated, the level of *preparation* and *planning* (""Planned everything out"") is very high.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes a past event: ""A month ago I wrote a suicide note... Planned everything out... Then sabotaged myself."" This clearly refers to a historical action that was highly prepared and nearly executed.
    *   It also refers to current/future intentions: ""I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly describes a past event where a suicide plan was fully developed (""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. wrote a suicide note, primed and ready"") and then self-interrupted (""sabotaged myself""). This goes beyond mere ideation or thinking about an attempt; it describes concrete preparatory actions that were halted. The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past... When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" The actions described (writing a note, planning time/place, having it ""primed and ready"") constitute significant concrete preparation, making it more than just a thought.
    *   Crucially, the 'Attempt' definition also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post perfectly fits this criterion, as it describes a detailed past near-attempt and also expresses current desires and future intent (""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time""). Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" strongly implies a desire for non-existence or death.
   - Emotional indicators: ""suffering"", ""don't feel it will ever end"", ""utter hell"", ""so alone and forgotten"", ""just a stain upon the world"", ""crying"", ""forsaken"", ""pain"", ""hanging on by threads"", ""endless pain"", ""fading memory"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a sense of worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" is a clear, albeit indirect, expression of a desire for non-existence, which aligns with ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" from the 'ideation' definition. This is more than just a vague feeling about dying; it's a contemplation of their own absence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and ongoing struggles (""I am suffering"", ""I am hanging on by threads at this moment"", ""the reason I stay now""). The ""if I were gone"" refers to a current/future hypothetical state.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains a clear indication of a desire for non-existence (""if I were gone""), which falls under ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" as per the 'ideation' definition.
   - It does not mention any specific plan or method, ruling out 'behavior'.
   - It does not describe any past attempts, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - It goes beyond general distress or sadness by contemplating their own absence, making it more than an 'indicator'. The phrase ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" implies that if such a desire *is* expressed, it's 'ideation'. ""If I were gone"" expresses this desire.

It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"").
    *   There is no mention of a past completed action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly states ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"". Also mentions ""it would be better if I was dead"", ""Everyone dies eventually"", ""death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep?

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There are no details about how the user would commit suicide (e.g., specific tools, locations, substances, or preparations like notes).
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned. The anecdote about the robbery is not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicide is selfish"", ""suicide would be better"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""it would be better if I was dead"", ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please"", ""next morning I'm dead?"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and suicidal thoughts, but no concrete plan or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""suicidal thoughts"" are current. The desire for death is a current feeling and a potential future state, but not a planned action. No past suicide attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"", ""it would be better if I was dead"", ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please"").
   - There is no mention of any specific plan (method, location, means) or preparations.

Last time I called a hotline just to have someone to talk to (didn't have a method or anything), I ended up having the cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward for 3 days. It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly mentions ""10x more suicidal"" and ""suicidal"". The context of calling a hotline previously also implies suicidal ideation.
   - Emotional indicators: ""worried"", ""paranoid"", ""irrational"". The experience ""made me 10x more suicidal"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" when the hotline was called last time. There is no mention of any current plan, method, or preparations.
   - References to past attempts: The post describes a past event where the police were called and the person was ""stuck in a psych ward for 3 days"" after calling a hotline. However, it explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" at that time, meaning no concrete suicide attempt occurred. The psych ward stay was a consequence of the hotline call, not an attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""10x more suicidal"", ""suicidal"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not a direct statement of wanting to die *now*, but the phrase ""10x more suicidal"" indicates current suicidal thoughts/feelings are present or exacerbated. The act of seeking a hotline also implies a desire to discuss these feelings.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" regarding the past, and no current method is indicated.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (hotline call, psych ward stay) and current/future intentions (finding a *new* hotline). The ""10x more suicidal"" refers to a current feeling.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal"").
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The post explicitly negates a method in the past.
   - Not 'Attempt' because while a past event is described (psych ward stay after a hotline call), it explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything,"" meaning no concrete suicide attempt occurred. The psych ward stay was a consequence, not an attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""10x more suicidal"") and a desire to talk about them (seeking a hotline), but without any specific plan or method.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I dont want to live anymore"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. This fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

   - It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - It is more than general distress or a vague feeling about death; it's a direct statement of not wanting to live, which goes beyond the 'Indicator' definition (""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post directly quotes ""If you are actually suicidal"" and uses the phrase ""until I die."" The user is reacting to accusations of ""attention seeking"" when they are ""trying to fucking hold on"" and ""still need help,"" strongly implying they are experiencing suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme rage, frustration, despair, feeling neglected and misunderstood (""FUCK OFF. I FUCKING HATE IT,"" ""makes me hate you,"" ""They don't care. They won't believe it until I die,"" ""YOU SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE."").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used in the context of the user's feelings, and ""until I die"" is a direct reference to death as a potential outcome of their current struggles. The user is defending their genuine suicidal feelings against dismissal.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the context of ""until I die"" and the struggle to ""hold on to whatever the hell I have left"" strongly implies a desire to not be alive or a struggle against that desire, indicating suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and struggles (""I'm trying to hold on,"" ""I still need help""). ""Until I die"" refers to a future outcome if their current distress is not acknowledged.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal"" and ""die"" in the context of the user's own feelings and struggle. There's a clear expression of distress and a need for help, indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or past attempt.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category as it describes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I feel like killing my self every day"", ""suicide note"", ""this might be my final good bye"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""so lonely"", ""so fucking tired"", ""no more strenght"", ""it huts so much"", ""dissapointed"", ""Im sad"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"". This clearly indicates preparations.
   - References to past attempts: ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer"" refers to past consideration or giving life a chance, not a concrete past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing my self"", ""suicide note"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I feel like killing my self every day"", ""this might be my final good bye"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., gun, pills) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"". The mention of a ""suicide note"" and getting ""bills, testament"" ready explicitly falls under ""preparations taken"" as per the 'Behavior' definition.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I feel like killing my self every day"", ""Everythings ready"", ""this might be my final good bye"" indicate current thoughts and future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past thoughts/considerations.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts.
   - Not 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond just thoughts/desires by explicitly mentioning preparations (""suicide note, bills, testament""). The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"".
   - 'Behavior' fits because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""killing my self"", ""final good bye"") and mentions preparations (""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"").
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action of attempting suicide is described. The post describes current readiness and future intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""kms"" (kill myself) multiple times (""i'm going to kms"", ""I'm about to kms"", ""I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon""). It also states, ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon."" and ""I can't stop cutting."" (self-harm).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""holding it all in"", ""about to explode"", ""can't keep it to myself anymore"", ""can't talk to anyone"", ""not ok"", ""don't know what to do anymore."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""cutting"" as an ongoing self-harm behavior. However, it does *not* specify a method, location, or detailed plan for the act of *suicide*. It states, ""I'm not sure when but I know I am [going to kill myself],"" indicating intent and a general timeframe (""soon"") but no concrete *how*. There are no mentions of acquiring means, writing notes, or identifying specific lethal locations for suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past *suicide attempts*. ""I can't stop cutting"" refers to ongoing self-harm, not a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""kms"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The post mentions ""cutting,"" which is self-harm. However, it does not describe a specific *lethal* method or plan for *suicide*. The intent to ""kms soon"" is present, but the *how* is missing.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations for suicide (e.g., suicide note, acquiring lethal means).
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I'm not sure when but I know I am [going to kill myself]."" This indicates a lack of a concrete plan. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current and future intentions (""I'm going to kms soon"", ""I'm about to kms"").
    *   ""I can't stop cutting"" refers to ongoing behavior.
    *   There are no descriptions of past *suicide attempts*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains clear and explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon."", ""I'm about to kms""). It lacks a specific plan for the *suicide* itself.
    *   **Behavior:** While the post mentions ""cutting"" (self-harming behavior), the definition for 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide"" or ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The post does not detail a specific *plan* for the *suicide* act, only a strong intent and general timeframe. The cutting is an ongoing behavior, but not presented as the specific *plan* for the stated suicide. The explicit ""I'm not sure when"" further supports the lack of a concrete plan. Therefore, it does not meet the full criteria for 'Behavior' as a *suicide plan*.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes current/future intent and ongoing self-harm, not a past suicide attempt.

    Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and intent without a specific, detailed plan for suicide. The mention of self-harm (cutting) is present, but the primary suicidal statements lack the specific planning required for the 'Behavior' category. The rule to lean towards 'Ideation' when unsure about an explicit plan is key.

   - This refers to past events (family finding out, intervention, notes found) but also very strong current intentions and desires (""really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"", ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot""). The notes were from the past, but the desire for a specific method is current.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and desire to die.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post includes a specific method (""shoot myself"") and mentions past preparations (""suicide notes"").
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as no concrete past suicide attempt is described, only past preparations and current ideation/planning.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Think I'm going to OD today."" User specifies the means: ""a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"" and the action: ""popping all of them at once"". This is a clear method (overdose) with specific means (medications).
   - References to past attempts: No, it mentions ""thinking about suicide for a while now"" which indicates past ideation, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""thinking about suicide for a while now"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Think I'm going to OD today"", ""hope for the best"" (implying hoping for death).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""OD today"" using ""a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"" by ""popping all of them at once"". This is a specific method (overdose) with specific means (medications).
   - Are there signs of preparation? The user has the means (the prescription drugs) and expresses the intent to use them immediately (""today"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Think I'm going to OD today"" refers to a current/future intention. ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"" refers to past ideation, but the primary focus is on the present intention to act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear plan.
   - Not 'Ideation' because there is a specific plan/method (overdose with specific medications) mentioned, which moves it beyond just thoughts. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - It fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""thinking about suicide for a while now"", ""can't feel anything right now"") and a specific plan to commit suicide (""Think I'm going to OD today. I have a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal and idk it's probably not even lethal but I feel like popping all of them at once""). This constitutes mentioning ""lethal medication/drugs"" and a method.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a *current intention/plan* (""going to OD today""), not a *past completed action*.

225,"Sorry. I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up. Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you to those who brought any light into my life. The end is the only thing that feels right now. Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson. I'm sorry I wasn't a better person.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""The end is the only thing that feels right now."" This phrase, especially in context with the apologies and farewells, strongly implies ending one's life.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Sorry. I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up. Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt... I'm sorry I wasn't a better person."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and regret. The ""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson"" combined with the apologies creates a strong farewell tone.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. No tools, locations, or specific actions are described.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" combined with the farewells (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt,"" ""thank you,"" ""Love you Mom, Dad..."") functions as an explicit declaration of intent to end one's life. It's more than just a vague feeling; it's a statement of finality.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" is a direct expression of a desire for life to end.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't present, the overall context and the phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" make the suicidal intent explicit and unambiguous. It's a clear desire to not be alive any longer.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post reads like a farewell note, which is a sign of preparation, but it does not detail *how* the end will occur.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. ""The end is the only thing that feels right *now*.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" in a farewell context), fitting the definition of 'Ideation' (""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"").
    *   It does not mention any specific plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe past attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death; the intent to end life is clearly conveyed through the combination of ""the end"" and the farewell message, thus it is not merely an 'Indicator'. The explicit nature of the desire to end life, even without the word ""suicide,"" places it in 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I was already suicidal"", ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel so bad"", ""feel terrible terrible"", ""mind is going crazy"", ""incredibly overwhelmed"", ""can't even cry"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific, lethal method.
   - References to past attempts: ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" refers to a past mental state, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I was already suicidal"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the desire to ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" implies a desire to end one's life/suffering.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific and explicit method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned, but a specific method is clearly stated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I was already suicidal"" refers to a past state. ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" refers to a current desire/intention. The core of the post is about current feelings and a desired action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only a past state of being suicidal.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a specific method is described.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") is mentioned. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - 'Behavior' fits because the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific plan/method (""cutting my god damn throat""). This falls under the definition's criteria for a ""specific method"" or ""tools/weapons (e.g. knives)"".
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past concrete action or attempt is described, only a past state of mind and a current desire for a specific action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""Quote about suicide"", ""if you want to kill yourself"" (within the quoted text).
    *   Emotional indicators: The user is not expressing their own emotions, but rather inquiring about a quote. The quote itself has a nihilistic tone.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, within the quote and in the user's description (""Quote about suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the user themselves. The user is asking for information about a quote, not expressing their own desire to die or suicidal thoughts. The rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"" is crucial here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a quote the user ""recently stumbled upon."" It's about the quote itself, not the user's current or past intentions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill yourself,"" but these are within the context of a quote the user is inquiring about.
    *   The user themselves is *not* expressing suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts. Their post is an information-seeking query about a philosophical quote.
    *   According to the rules, ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" Since the person writing the post is not expressing any personal suicidal ideation or intent, despite the topic of the quote, the risk level for the user is minimal.
    *   'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" *from the user*. This is not present.
    *   'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are clearly not applicable.
    *   'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" While the *word* suicide is present, it's not an *expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings* by the user. The user is not indicating *their own* suicidal thoughts or feelings. Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category as there's no direct indication of the *user's* suicidal thoughts or feelings.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore"". These are explicit expressions of a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""not happy anymore"", ""never been truly happy"", ""life so difficult"", ""give up on everything"", ""endless loop"", ""my life will never get better"", ""accepted that"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""ready to join my dog"" expresses a readiness to die, but not a plan.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" is not used, phrases like ""i want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", and ""ready to join my dog"" are very explicit expressions of a desire to end one's life. This goes beyond vague feelings and directly expresses a wish to not be alive.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, clearly.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear; the desire to die is explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit planning, so 'behavior' is not applicable.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""i want to leave earth"", ""i'm ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore"" all refer to current and future intentions. ""i always end up wanting to die"" refers to a recurring current state.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""i want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The post does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide, which rules out 'Behavior'.
   - The post does not describe any past suicide attempts, which rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

229,"My grandpa passed away tonight. I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit. Now, I know I can't do that. My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" It also discusses the death of the user's grandpa and the emotional impact on the family.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user describes their mom doing ""awful"" and crying, and expresses a newfound ""appreciation for my life."" The phrase ""Nothing has changed for me"" suggests underlying issues persist, but the immediate intent has shifted.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A past *intention* to ""kill myself before Christmas hit"" is mentioned, but no specific method or current plan is detailed.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts (concrete actions) are described. The phrase ""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself"" refers to a past *intention/plan*, not a past *action*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I was going to kill myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post describes a *past* desire (""I was going to kill myself""). However, it immediately negates this for the present: ""Now, I know I can't do that"" and ""his passing has saved my life for the time being."" Therefore, there is no *current* direct expression of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post describes a *past* intention, but no *current* plan or method. The user states they ""can't do that"" now.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a *past intention* (""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself"") that has been *averted* for the present moment (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""his passing has saved my life for the time being"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** The definition states, ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" This is initially problematic because ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned. However, the 'Ideation' definition includes a crucial clarifying rule: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" In this post, the user explicitly states they ""can't do that"" now and that their life has been ""saved for the time being,"" indicating a *current lack* of desire to die or commit suicide. While suicide is mentioned, it's in the context of a *past* intention that is *no longer active*.
    *   **Ideation:** The definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The post describes a *past* desire, but *currently* expresses the opposite (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""saved my life for the time being""). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for *current* ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** This requires a current plan or self-harming behavior, neither of which is present.
    *   **Attempt:** This requires a concrete past action/attempt, which is not described. The post refers to a past *intention*, not an *attempt*.

Given that the post explicitly states a *current lack* of suicidal intent (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""saved my life for the time being""), despite mentioning a past intention, the most appropriate classification based on the provided rules (specifically ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"") is 'indicator'. The post describes a de-escalation of risk.

230,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts about suicide"" multiple times, ""think about suicide,"" ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" and ""want to commit suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""serious thoughts,"" ""get me so mad,"" ""social anxiety & seasonal depression,"" ""adds to the fire,"" ""feel like i'm faking it,"" ""Am i being dramatic about this?"" These indicate distress, anger, and self-doubt.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user states, ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself."" This indicates an active search for methods, but not a specific, chosen method or any preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). It's an exploration of possibilities, not a concrete plan.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned. The thoughts are described as recent (""for the whole month of February"") and ongoing/recurrent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by the repeated thoughts of suicide and researching ways to kill oneself.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is *chosen* or *identified* as *the* plan. The user is *researching* ways, which means they are looking for options, not stating a definite method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The research for ways is a strong form of ideation, but it does not cross the threshold into a ""specific plan"" or ""preparations taken"" as required for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to recent past thoughts (""for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts"") and current/recurrent thoughts and actions (""When we fight I always think about suicide,"" ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself""). There are no descriptions of past *attempts*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past attempts are described.
   - The post clearly expresses ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" and a ""desire to not be alive any longer"" (e.g., ""want to commit suicide""). The act of ""researching for easy painless ways to kill myself"" is a strong form of suicidal ideation, showing a progression from just thoughts to actively seeking information about how to act on those thoughts. However, it does not describe a *specific plan* (e.g., ""I will use X method on Y date"") or *preparations taken* (e.g., ""I have acquired Z""). The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" Researching *for* ways is not the same as having *a specific plan*. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Life is useless."", ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"". The word ""suicide"" is explicitly used.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Life is useless"" indicates hopelessness and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post speculates about an afterlife but doesn't mention *how* to achieve it or any preparations.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""Life is useless"" combined with the desire for a different state of being (""a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being"") and the call to normalize suicide strongly suggests a desire to not be alive in the current state.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and a general statement about normalizing suicide. No past attempts. No concrete future plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned, and there are direct expressions of dissatisfaction with life and a desire for an end to the current state.
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The post is speculative about an afterlife, not detailing a means to an end.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   It fits 'Ideation' because it contains explicit expressions related to suicide (""Death and suicide need to be normalized"") and a desire to escape life (""Life is useless."", ""a life you live without thought or human Emotions""), but without any specific plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thought of death"", ""never feel pain anymore"", ""never deal with the hassle"", ""to be nothing in a black sea of infinity"", ""to let go after holding on so tight"". No direct mention of ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: Expresses a longing for the peace and escape that death offers, implying current pain and hassle. This suggests a desire to escape suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post romanticizes the *concept* of death as an escape from pain and hassle. It expresses a desire for the *state* of death (""to be nothing"", ""to let go""). However, the definition for 'Indicator' states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" The post does not say ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" It's a contemplation of the *thought of death* as beautiful and a release, which falls under ""a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current contemplation/feelings. No past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
   - Not 'Behavior' as no plan or method is mentioned.
   - The decision is between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'. While the post expresses a strong desire for the peace associated with death, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or commit suicide by the author's own hand. It focuses on the *concept* of death as an escape. The rules emphasize that ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'"" and ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Since ""suicide"" or ""I want to die"" is not explicitly stated, and it's more of a contemplation of the state of death, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category based on the strict definitions.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post outlines a conditional plan: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" It also mentions the intent to use a method: ""I'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day."" While a specific tool or location isn't named, the explicit statement of intent to find and use ""any method"" constitutes a form of explicit planning for the act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no explicit mentions of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i'll kill myself"" and ""committing suicide"" are direct mentions.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day"" and ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The post states, ""I'll use any method i can."" While not a specific method (e.g., ""pills"" or ""jumping""), this is an explicit statement of intent to find and use *a method* to end their life, which is a form of planning. The post also presents a clear conditional plan: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (like acquiring means) are mentioned. However, the stated intent to find ""any method"" indicates a move beyond mere thought into the realm of planning for action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and future intentions contingent on a COVID test result (""i'll be deciding what to do once i get them,"" ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a strong desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts or feelings. It includes a conditional plan (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"") and an explicit statement of intent to find and use a method (""I'll use any method i can""). This commitment to finding and using a means, even if the specific means isn't named, constitutes ""some form of explicit planning"" as per the 'Behavior' definition. It's not just ideation; it's a decision to act under a specific condition and a commitment to finding a way to do so. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""cant fucking kill myself properly"", ""kill myself"", ""stop being a burden and a disappointment"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Failrure"", ""burden"", ""disappointment"", ""Please help, i have nobody else"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" (describes a past action/method). ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" (asking for a future method/plan).
   - References to past attempts: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" is a clear description of a past suicide attempt (taking an overdose).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" is mentioned multiple times.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""kill myself and stop being a burden and a disappoinment.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (a specific past method). The user is also asking for a future method (""What shoul i do kill mslef"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the zopiclone implies preparation for the past attempt.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. The phrase ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" clearly describes a past event/attempt. The question ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" refers to current ideation and seeking a future plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"").
   - The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
   - This post perfectly fits the 'Attempt' category because it details a concrete past attempt and also expresses current suicidal thoughts and a desire to find a new method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Goodbye"", ""end it tonight"", ""I will be non existent"". These are direct expressions of ending one's life.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""struggling with depression for god knows how long"" indicates severe distress and hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another while bottle of Advil"". This is a very specific method (overdose) and implies the means are present or acquired.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end it tonight"" and ""I will be non existent"" in the context of a specific method to achieve this.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Goodbye"", ""end it tonight"", ""I will be non existent"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another while bottle of Advil"". This is a clear, specific method involving lethal medication.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, having the ""whole bottle"" implies the means are at hand.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""going to end it tonight"", ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""end it tonight"", ""non existent"") and a very specific plan/method (""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another while bottle of Advil""). This directly matches the definition of 'Behavior', which requires explicit suicidal thoughts AND a plan/method or preparations. It is not 'Ideation' because a specific plan is present. It is not 'Attempt' as it describes future intent, not a past action. It is clearly not 'Indicator' due to the explicit nature of the thoughts and plan.

    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., how, where, with what). Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly describes a ""past attempt"" at suicide (""one month from my last suicide attempt"").
   - The definition for 'Attempt' is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared."" While ""hurt myself"" is mentioned, it's immediately followed by a negation of a plan. The ""awful thoughts"" are not explicitly defined as suicidal.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""frustrating to hold my tears,"" ""eyes are burning,"" ""can't sleep anymore,"" ""can't bring myself to do what I enjoy,"" ""felt guilty,"" ""so tired,"" ""drowning in these awful thoughts,"" ""so scared.""

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" No methods or preparations are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. There is no mention of ""suicide,"" ""killing myself,"" or ""ending my life.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses extreme distress and fatigue (""I can't take it anymore,"" ""I'm so tired"") but not a direct desire to die or not be alive. The ""awful thoughts"" are not specified as suicidal.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The mention of ""hurt myself"" is immediately negated by the lack of a plan, and the ""awful thoughts"" are vague. There is no explicit desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and ongoing distress (""I can't take it anymore,"" ""I've been drowning,"" ""I'm so scared"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness. It lacks any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. Although ""hurt myself"" is mentioned, it's in the context of *not* having a plan, and the ""awful thoughts"" are not explicitly defined as suicidal. According to the definition, ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This applies here as there is no explicit desire to die or explicit suicidal thought.
    *   **Ideation:** This category requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is not present in the post.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires explicit thoughts *and* a plan or self-harming behavior. The post explicitly states the absence of a plan.
    *   **Attempt:** This category requires a description of past suicide attempts. This is not present.

Based on the analysis, particularly the lack of explicit suicidal ideation or a desire to die, and the explicit statement about not having a plan, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category.

I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them.

I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None for suicide. The self-harm ideation is explicitly stated as not acted upon. Passive death wishes are not plans.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression"". This mentions hospitalization for depression, not a specific description of a past suicide attempt. The definition for 'Attempt' requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)"". This post does not describe such an action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time."" These are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The self-harm ideation (""imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself"") is explicitly stated as *not acted upon* (""never purposely hurt myself""), so it does not qualify as 'behavior'.

    *   The primary focus is on current feelings and intentions (""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every day"").
    *   Past event: ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression."" This is a past event, but it's for depression, not a described suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and suicidal thoughts (""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every fucking day""), which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
    *   **Ideation:** Fits well. The post contains clear and explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time""). However, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. There is no mention of a specific plan (method, location, means) for suicide, nor any description of self-harming *behavior*. The self-harm thoughts are explicitly stated as not acted upon.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hurting,"" ""depressed,"" ""exhausting,"" ""my own body is giving up."" These indicate severe emotional distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific active plan or method is mentioned. ""Die in my sleep"" is a passive wish, not an active method or preparation.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear; the desire to die is explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No active methods are mentioned. ""Die in my sleep"" is a passive wish, not a method the person intends to *execute*.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""tonight"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of a desire to die (""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"").
   - However, it does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation to actively cause death. ""Die in my sleep"" is a passive wish for death to occur naturally, not a plan to commit suicide.
   - This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no active plan or method. It is more than an 'Indicator' due to the explicit desire to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements are ""Zoloft overdose,"" ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg,"" and ""It obviously wasn't enough to kill me.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: A specific method (""Zoloft overdose,"" ""took 6 pills"") is mentioned, and the action has already occurred. This is not a future plan but a past behavior.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: ""at 11:30 I took..."" refers to a past event. ""It obviously wasn't enough to kill me"" describes the outcome of that past event. The post is about a completed action.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post describes a concrete action (""took 6 pills"") that occurred in the past (""at 11:30"") with the clear intent to end one's life (""wasn't enough to kill me""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""

At peace knowing it's soon. Hope my plan works though, there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""At peace knowing it's soon"", ""Hope my plan works"", ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"". These phrases strongly indicate suicidal intent.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""calm about it"", ""At peace"". This suggests a firm, resolved decision.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Hope my plan works"". While no specific method (e.g., a specific tool or location) is detailed, the explicit mention of ""my plan"" and the hope that it ""works"" implies a concrete plan has been formulated and is imminent. ""Destined to do it"" and ""it's soon"" reinforce the imminence.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the expressions ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""At peace knowing it's soon"", ""Hope my plan works"", and ""no way I'm living"" are direct and explicit expressions of intent to end one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no way I'm living"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a detailed method, but the *existence* of ""my plan"" is explicitly stated.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""made my decision"", ""it's soon"", and the reliance on ""my plan works"" all point to a formulated plan and imminent action. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The phrase ""my plan works"" strongly suggests an explicit plan is in place, even if the details are not shared. This is more than just ideation; it implies a concrete, actionable plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""destined to do it"", ""it's soon"", ""Hope my plan works"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There are explicit expressions of intent to end life and a clear reference to a plan.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While 'Ideation' includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, it specifically states ""without any specific plan"". This post explicitly mentions ""my plan"" and the hope that it ""works,"" which goes beyond mere thoughts and indicates a formulated plan.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""no way I'm living"", ""destined to do it"") and explicitly mentions ""a plan to commit suicide"" (""Hope my plan works""). The phrases ""made my decision"" and ""it's soon"" further support the notion of a concrete, imminent plan. Even without specific method details, the *mention* of ""my plan"" is a strong indicator of explicit planning as per the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. This describes future intent, not a past action.

I can deal with difficulties in life but realizing you're hopeless is too much. I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better. I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide forum"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Hopeless"", ""felt hopeless for months"", ""realizing you're hopeless is too much"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation for an act of suicide is mentioned. The user is looking for a forum.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide forum"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The desire to find a ""suicide forum"" combined with profound hopelessness strongly indicates suicidal thoughts/feelings, even without the exact phrase ""I want to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. Seeking a forum is not a ""plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior"" as defined for 'behavior' (which requires specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations like a note). The instruction states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""I just want to find..."").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide forum"") and there's a clear indication of suicidal thoughts.
   - Not 'behavior' because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation for an *act* of suicide. Seeking a forum is not equivalent to having a plan or taking preparatory steps for an attempt.
   - Not 'attempt' as no past attempt is described.
   - This fits 'ideation' because it includes explicit expressions related to suicide and a desire to end the current state of hopelessness (implying a desire to not be alive), but without a concrete plan.

Idc if no one responds I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die even though I know it's painful idc just want an end",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""die"", ""slash my wrists and die"", ""just want an end"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""disgusting to look at"", ""low my expectations"", ""Why couldn't I get even that?"", ""on the verge of trying"", ""idc just want an end"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""slash my wrists"" is a specific method. ""on the verge of trying"" indicates immediate intent to act on this method.
   - References to past attempts: ""I tried, I guess."" This is vague. It could refer to trying to get away from parents or a vague past attempt at something else. It's not a clear description of a past suicide attempt. The primary focus is on current intent.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""slash my wrists and die"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""die"", ""just want an end"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slash my wrists"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""on the verge of trying"" indicates an immediate intention to carry out the mentioned method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die"" clearly refers to current and imminent future intentions. The ""I tried, I guess"" is ambiguous and less central than the current intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""want an end"", ""die"").
   - Crucially, it mentions a specific method (""slash my wrists"") and indicates an immediate intent to act on it (""on the verge of trying"").
   - This aligns perfectly with the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method..."".
   - While ""I tried, I guess"" is present, it's too vague to classify as a past 'attempt' definitively, and the strong current intent with a specific method takes precedence for classification. The post's primary risk is the current plan and intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I cannot wait to die"", ""at least the pain will all be gone"", ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""my life is not able to be fixed"", ""no-one I know has gone through the things I have gone through"", ""That is the most bullshit phase I have ever heard"", ""pain will all be gone"". These indicate severe hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it"". This is a clear statement of preparation for death, specifically addressing the financial aftermath. While not a method of suicide, it is a preparation for the event of death.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I cannot wait to die"", ""at least the pain will all be gone"".
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The desire to die is explicit, so it's not 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"". This is a preparation taken in anticipation of death, which aligns with the 'Behavior' definition (""preparations taken"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I cannot wait to die"", ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I cannot wait to die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
   - The post also includes a clear sign of preparation for death: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"". This goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings (Ideation) and indicates a concrete step or plan related to the outcome of suicide. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken"". Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category.
   - There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, loss, and a lack of purpose for the future.
   - Mentions of death/suicide/self-harm: None explicit.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""what's really the point?"" expresses existential despair and hopelessness but is not a direct statement of wanting to die or end one's life.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is unclear if there's an *explicit* desire to die. The post expresses a profound lack of hope for the future and a sense of meaninglessness, which are risk factors, but not direct suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to past experiences (""summer of my life is over"", ""perfect happiness"") and current/future outlook (""destined to live a depressed life"", ""can't see my future""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post conveys significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling that life has lost its meaning. This aligns with ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness"".
   - Crucially, it does *not* contain any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or a desire to not be alive.
   - According to the definitions, if ""suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned"" and there's no ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"", it falls under 'Indicator'. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" further supports this classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""highest chance of death"", ""jump from a bridge"".
   - Emotional indicators: Implied distress, seeking a fatal outcome.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""jump from a bridge"" (method), ""which one do I have the highest chance of death"" (seeking specific location/information for planning), ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"" (timeline for action/preparation).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""highest chance of death"" in the context of jumping from a bridge is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump from a bridge"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, asking for advice on the ""best bet"" bridge for ""highest chance of death"" and stating ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"" are clear signs of planning and preparation for a specific method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and future actions (""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""highest chance of death"").
   - It mentions a specific method (""jump from a bridge"").
   - It includes elements of planning by asking for the ""best bet"" location and setting a timeline (""by the weekend"") for choosing one.
   - This fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a plan (method, seeking specific location, timeline for selection). It goes beyond mere ideation because a specific method and a timeline for action are present. It is not an 'Attempt' as it describes future intentions, not past actions.

The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states, ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free."" This is a statement of despair that death (and thus freedom from pain) will *not* occur, rather than a direct desire for death or suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""treat me like shit,"" ""suffer,"" ""live in pain,"" ""pain will never loosen it's grip,"" ""This is my destiny."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being trapped.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expressions. The post expresses despair about *not* being able to die and therefore being trapped in pain, rather than a direct desire to die or end life. The phrase ""I am convinced that I will never die"" is the opposite of wanting to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Given the absence of direct statements like ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself,"" and the specific phrasing about *not* dying, it leans heavily towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a perceived inescapable future (""I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempts are described.
    *   **Behavior:** No plan or self-harm is mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" While the post conveys extreme suffering and hopelessness, it *does not* explicitly state a desire to die or not be alive. In fact, the line ""I am convinced that I will never die"" expresses despair that death will *not* come, meaning the pain will be eternal. This is a crucial distinction from a desire to die.
    *   **Indicator:** The post ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" It contains ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and a ""vague feeling about dying or death"" (in the sense of being trapped by not dying), but ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The rule ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned"" applies here. The despair is profound, but the explicit desire to end life is absent.

Based on the analysis, particularly the lack of explicit suicidal statements and the phrasing about *not* dying, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a desire for an end to suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific current plan (e.g., method, location, time) or preparations are mentioned for the speaker's own suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, the speaker explicitly states: ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work...""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times, both in reference to the sister and in the speaker's own past and current thoughts.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" and ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."" These are clear expressions of a desire for an end to life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for a *current* plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post expresses a desire for an end, but no concrete ""how"" or ""when"" for a *current* suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to past events: Sister's suicide (548 days ago), speaker's aborted attempt (6 years ago).
    *   Refers to current/future intentions: ""But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" and ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."" These are current feelings and desires.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions a past suicide attempt by the author (""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago""). This directly aligns with the primary definition of 'Attempt'.
    *   The post also contains current explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from""). These are current suicidal ideation, not a concrete plan (which would be 'Behavior').
    *   The 'Attempt' definition includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While the current expressions are ideation rather than a concrete ""plan"" as defined under 'Behavior', the presence of *any* current suicidal content (thoughts or feelings) alongside a past attempt typically elevates the risk to 'Attempt' in such classification systems. Given the explicit past attempt and the current strong suicidal ideation, the 'Attempt' category is the most appropriate.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" is a clear, explicit reference to suicide. The apology and ""its for the best"" also strongly imply ending life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""disappointment"", ""nothing"", ""no hope"", ""no joy"", ""no emotion"", ""pain is numb"" all indicate severe hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" specifies a method and location. ""there will be less of a mess"" suggests consideration of the practicalities of the act, reinforcing a concrete plan. The ""I'm sorry... Thank You"" part reads like a farewell note.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" is an explicit statement of intent to commit suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the entire context, especially the plan, indicates a strong desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""in the tub"" is a specific location/method. The mention of ""less of a mess"" further details the nature of the planned act.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement of a specific plan (""I plan on doing it in the tub"") and the farewell message (""I'm sorry to those who cared about me... Thank You"") indicate preparation and intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/future intentions (""I plan on doing it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I can't continue this disappointment"", ""no hope anymore"") and, crucially, mentions a specific plan to commit suicide (""I plan on doing it in the tub"", ""there will be less of a mess""). This clearly fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit planning with a specific method/location. It goes beyond mere ideation because a plan is stated. It is not 'Attempt' as it describes a future plan, not a past action.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Not applicable as there is no ideation.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and desires.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post expresses general distress and a desire for relief from pain and comfort. There is no explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, or a desire to die. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' which covers general expressions of distress without explicit suicidal content.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" - Explicit statement of suicidal intent.
        *   ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" - Explicit suicidal ideation.
        *   ""I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants... secretly to cope... after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water..."" - This describes specific self-harming behaviors (misuse of medication, self-starvation) that have caused physical damage.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, despair, trauma, neglect, loneliness, failure, and physical/mental distress are pervasive throughout the post.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** While not a traditional ""plan"" like a time and place, the detailed description of misusing medication to the point of organ damage and self-starvation constitutes ""self-harming behavior"" and a ""specific method"" of causing harm to oneself, which is explicitly covered under the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes past traumas and ongoing self-harming behaviors, but not a past *suicide attempt* that was a discrete, completed action aimed at ending life. The self-harm described is current/recent behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and ""wanting to end it.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. The post details the misuse of painkillers/antidepressants leading to liver/digestive damage and subsequent self-starvation. This is a concrete, self-harming behavior that causes physical harm and is presented in the context of wanting to ""end it."" The 'Behavior' definition includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" and ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" The detailed description of the medication misuse and self-starvation fits the ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" part.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The phrase ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" indicates current intent/ideation.
    *   The description of medication misuse and starvation (""I started Taking... led to my addiction... It damaged my liver... i would puke... i starve my self..."") describes an ongoing or very recent pattern of behavior, not a past, completed suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""wanting to end it,"" ""going to end it""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   Beyond just thoughts, the post describes concrete, self-harming behaviors (misuse of medication leading to organ damage, self-starvation) that are causing physical harm. These actions fall under ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" as per the 'Behavior' definition. This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation'.
    *   The post does not describe a past, completed suicide attempt, but rather ongoing/recent self-harming behaviors and current suicidal thoughts. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not the correct category.

    Based on the explicit suicidal ideation combined with the detailed description of current/recent self-harming behaviors that cause physical damage, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"", ""I really want to fucking kill myself"", ""suicidal thoughts... now they're coming back"", ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head"", ""I feel like cutting myself again"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I have no one""), despair, anger (""Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.""), loss, distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" This describes a specific method (train crushing head) and a specific location (train station, train tracks near house).
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"" indicates a history of ideation. ""I feel like cutting myself again"" implies past self-harm. While not explicitly stated as a ""suicide attempt,"" in the context of suicidal thoughts and desires, past self-harm is often considered a form of suicidal behavior or a past attempt for classification purposes, especially when combined with current suicidal intent.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""I really want to fucking kill myself.""
    *   Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: ""I really want to fucking kill myself,"" and the detailed description of wanting to be crushed by a train.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Yes, specific methods are mentioned: ""lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head.""
    *   Yes, there are signs of preparation/action towards a plan: ""running away to the train station near my house.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current/future intentions (""I really want to fucking kill myself,"" ""I'm thinking about running away..."").
    *   It also refers to past events: ""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"" (past ideation) and ""I feel like cutting myself again"" (implies past self-harm/suicidal behavior).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I really want to fucking kill myself"") and a specific, detailed plan (""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head""). This strongly points towards 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the post also states ""I feel like cutting myself again,"" which implies a history of self-harm. In the context of suicidal ideation, this past self-harm can be interpreted as a past suicidal behavior or attempt.
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Given the explicit current plan and the strong implication of past suicidal behavior (""cutting myself again"" in the context of ""suicidal thoughts""), the 'Attempt' category is the most appropriate as it encompasses both the past action and the current high-risk plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I have wanted to die"", ""suicide attempts"", ""kill myself"", ""not allowed to die"", ""world lets me die"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, frustration (""pissed as fuck""), jealousy. Mentions ""medication resilient major depressive disorder"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No current specific plan or method for suicide is mentioned. The ""thorazine dri0"" is mentioned in the context of being a ""zombie"" if forced to live, not as a method to end life.
   - References to past attempts: Explicitly states ""I had a few suicide attempts"" and ""the most successful attempt involved me being saved"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""suicide attempts"", ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I have wanted to die"", ""I should be able to kill myself"", ""world lets me die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No current specific methods for suicide are mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit planning for current suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to past events (""I had a few suicide attempts"", ""the most successful attempt involved me being saved"") and current/future intentions/desires (""I have wanted to die"", ""I should be able to kill myself"", ""If I am forced to live then put me on a thorazine dri0..."").
   - Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I had a few suicide attempts"". This directly matches the definition of the 'Attempt' category: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past..."".
   - The rule for 'Attempt' also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While there are no current *plans* (which would be 'behavior'), there are strong current *ideations*. The primary and most definitive element in this post, according to the definitions, is the explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""end my own life,"" ""I'm going to try again.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""Nothing in my life feels real""), despair, guilt, anger, shame (""shame for failing""), self-loathing (""I'm such a fucking loser""), feelings of abandonment and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" This indicates a planned, more effective method for a future attempt, even if the exact method isn't named. The ""math is off"" suggests a calculation related to a method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real,"" ""I feel shame for failing,"" and ""I'm going to try again"" explicitly state past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""kill myself,"" ""end my own life,"" ""try again"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by the desire to ""kill myself"" and ""end my own life.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a named method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""gun""), but the description ""a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off"" strongly implies a more concrete and potentially lethal plan than vague ideation. The ""math"" comment suggests a calculated approach.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The intention to use a ""different method"" that is ""much easier"" indicates a mental preparation for a more effective future attempt.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both: past attempts (""failing,"" ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real"") and current/future intentions (""I'm going to try again,"" ""tommorow maybe, maybe next week, maybe next month, maybe next year"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes past actions: ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real"" and ""I feel shame for failing."" This fits the definition of 'Attempt' for describing past actions.
    *   Crucially, the 'Attempt' definition states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post explicitly refers to past attempts (""failing"") and also mentions current/future plans (""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier..."").
    *   Therefore, based on the explicit mention of past attempts and ongoing planning for future attempts, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I'm going out of this world"", ""I'm offing myself then"", ""Goodbye world."" ""Offing myself"" is a clear, albeit euphemistic, statement of intent to commit suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I'm not worth living"" indicates hopelessness and low self-worth.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post specifies a precise date and time: ""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours."" This, combined with the explicit statement ""I'm offing myself then,"" constitutes a highly specific plan regarding *when* the action will occur. While a *method* is not explicitly stated, the exact time and date for the intended act signifies explicit planning.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm offing myself then"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going out of this world at that time,"" ""I'm not worth living.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post provides a very precise date and time for the intended action (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours.""). This level of temporal specificity for a planned suicide constitutes ""explicit planning"" or ""preparations taken"" as per the 'Behavior' definition, even without a named method. It's a scheduled event.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a definite future intention: ""April 13, 2021... I'm going out... I'm offing myself then.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""offing myself"") and there is a clear desire to die.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond vague thoughts or a general desire to die. The post includes a very specific date and time for the intended action, which constitutes explicit planning. The 'Ideation' definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While a method isn't named, the precise *when* (date and time) for the act is a strong element of a concrete plan.
    *   It best fits 'Behavior'. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'm not worth living"", ""offing myself"") and mentions a specific plan to commit suicide by providing a precise date and time for the act. This level of detail about *when* the act will occur signifies ""explicit planning"" as defined for 'Behavior'.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as it describes a future intention, not a past action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""dying."" However, ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" strongly implies a desire to no longer exist. ""I have to make it stop"" in the context of causing ""upset and pain and hurt"" suggests ending one's own life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Can't do this anymore,"" ""upset,"" ""pain,"" ""hurt"" indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and self-blame.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" is a direct expression of a desire not to be alive. ""I have to make it stop"" in this context further reinforces the intent to end their own existence. This fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't present, the desire to not be alive is clearly expressed. This is not vague; it's a direct statement about their perceived absence making others happier, which is a common form of suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I just can't do this anymore,"" ""I have to make it stop"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'Indicator' because there *is* an explicit expression of a desire not to be alive (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me""). The definition of 'Indicator' states ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post clearly indicates suicidal thoughts/feelings.
   - It fits 'Ideation' because it contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrases clearly convey a desire to end one's existence without detailing how.
   - It's not 'Behavior' because no specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
   - It's not 'Attempt' because it describes current thoughts/feelings, not a past action.

I feel lost and alone and like no one understands me. I tried going to therapy but I couldn't bring myself to actually talk to him about how I feel because it hurts so much I can't even think about it anymore. I hate myself, I make mistakes and make it everyone's life progressively worse. I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this. I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital. Both would just make this living hell even more unbearable. Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it. They wouldn't have to try and care for me anymore. I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better. I don't have anything to look forward to other than more mistakes and ruin.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly mentions ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it"" and ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it."" These are direct references to suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""lost and alone,"" ""no one understands me,"" ""I hate myself,"" ""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge,"" ""living hell,"" ""nothing is better than this."" These indicate extreme despair, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) are mentioned. The phrase ""afraid of botching it"" implies a general consideration of an attempt but not a detailed plan. No preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are described. ""I would have done it already"" refers to a current desire/intention, not a past action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it"" and ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this."" and ""nothing is better than this.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post mentions the *fear* of botching an attempt, but not a specific method (e.g., ""I'm going to jump,"" ""I'm going to take pills"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The user is expressing current feelings and a desire to act, but is held back by fear.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to not be alive (""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge,"" ""I would have done it already,"" ""nothing is better than this""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. While there is a strong desire and consideration of suicide, the absence of a concrete plan (as required by the 'Behavior' definition: ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"") means it does not fit 'Behavior'. The fear of ""botching it"" indicates a thought about an action, but not a detailed plan.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no explicit plan or method is mentioned, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit.

    *   **References to past attempts:** The entire post is a reflection on two past events (""in the past year or two,"" ""Both of these happened long enough ago"") where the user engaged in actions with suicidal intent, questioning if they qualify as attempts. The second event explicitly states ""I went in with the intention of dying.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

The second time, ""I went in with the intention of dying"" and ""stopped myself."" These are actions taken with a method in mind.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I went in with the intention of dying"" and engaging with a method suggests preparation.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, two distinct past events are described where the user engaged in actions with suicidal intent, even if they stopped before completion. The second event explicitly states ""I went in with the intention of dying.""

A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The post describes two ""historic actions"" where the user engaged with a method, went to the ""point of no return,"" and for one, had the ""intention of dying.""

I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear, not unclear.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit planning, so 'ideation' is appropriate over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The desire to die (""I really want to die"") is current. Past events (childhood, bullying) are discussed as context for current feelings, but the suicidal ideation is present.

    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""contemplating suicide"", ""looking up how to do it"", ""wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself so this nightmare could all be over"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""depression ruined a great life"", ""fucking hell"", ""destroys any hope of me getting better"", ""throws my mental health down a never ending pit"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself"" as desired methods, but explicitly states ""I wish I had the courage to..."", indicating a lack of current intent or plan to execute. No preparations are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""contemplating suicide"", ""looking up how to do it"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""wish I had the courage to... so this nightmare could all be over"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The phrase ""I wish I had the courage to..."" indicates a desire for the act, but not a current plan or preparation. It implies a barrier (lack of courage) to acting on these thoughts.
    *   Given the explicit ""wish I had the courage to..."", there is no explicit plan or preparation. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current intentions and thoughts (""contemplating suicide"", ""looking up how to do it"", ""wish I had the courage""). There are no past attempts described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""contemplating suicide"", ""looking up how to do it"", ""wish I had the courage to... so this nightmare could all be over""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   While specific methods are mentioned (""jump in front of a car"", ""stab myself""), the crucial phrase ""I wish I had the courage to..."" indicates that these are desired outcomes or methods, not concrete plans or preparations being acted upon. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The lack of courage implies the absence of such a plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Based on the explicit suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but without a concrete plan or preparation, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

You can't trust anyone because no matter what they say you know deep down at some point they're going to leave you. My ex told me 'let's promise to each other that no matter what we'll always work through our problems' but guess you left as soon as things got tough. She did. I can't trust anyone, the second I do I get burned. I'm so fucking stupid. Fuck the entire human race. I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all. If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all,"" ""If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace."" These are strong expressions of a desire for non-existence or death.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nothing Is Beautiful,"" ""All my life has been is work, be alone, disappointment and failure""), despair (""I'm so fucking done with this shit,"" ""I hate this so much""), anger (""Fuck the entire human race""), self-loathing (""I'm so fucking stupid"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan for the individual's *own* suicide is mentioned. The wish for a nuclear bomb is a general desire for collective death, not a personal method or plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, very explicitly: ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back."" The desire for death/non-existence is clear.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear. The desire to die/not be alive is explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for the individual to commit suicide is mentioned. The ""nuclear bomb"" is a general wish for global death, not a personal plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit personal planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions and feelings (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out,"" ""I wish..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die/not be alive, which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
   - **Ideation:** This fits perfectly. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" and the general desire for an end to existence through the nuclear bomb wish), but crucially, it lacks any specific plan or method for the individual to commit suicide.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for the individual's own suicide. The nuclear bomb wish is not a personal suicide plan.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""It will all be done after I die."", ""I want to die"", ""pull the trigger"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""so much pressure"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""pull the trigger"" implies a gun as a method.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I want to die"", ""pull the trigger"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pull the trigger"" is a specific method involving a weapon.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the mention of a specific action (""pull the trigger"") constitutes a method.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""It will all be done after I die."", ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"") and mentions a specific method (""pull the trigger""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit suicidal thoughts and a mention of a plan or method (e.g., tools/weapons suitable to end one's life).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I hurt myself two months ago"" (explicit self-harm). ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" (explicit mention of death as a solution/escape).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""nothing happend,"" ""she doesn't care,"" ""tired of putting a mask on,"" ""pain,"" ""tired all the time."" (Indicates hopelessness, despair, feeling isolated and uncared for).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: ""I hurt myself two months ago."" This describes a past act of self-harm. The post does not explicitly state this self-harm was a ""suicide attempt"" (i.e., an action taken with the intent to die). It's presented as ""I hurt myself"" and then ""I told my mother.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free."" This is a clear expression of desiring death as an escape from current suffering. This is a strong indicator of suicidal thoughts/feelings.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan or method mentioned for ending life.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I hurt myself two months ago"" refers to a past event. ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" refers to a current feeling/desire for the future.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? A past act of self-harm is described (""I hurt myself""). However, the post does not explicitly state this was a ""suicide attempt"" (i.e., an action with the intent to die). The definition of 'Attempt' requires ""past attempts at suicide"" and ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" While ""I hurt myself"" is a concrete action, the intent to die is not specified, making it distinct from an explicit ""suicide attempt.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is an explicit expression of desiring death (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").
    *   **Ideation:** Fits well. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" implies a desire to not be alive any longer), but without any specific plan to commit suicide.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan or preparations for suicide. The past self-harm is not a *current* plan or *current* behavior.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. While past self-harm is mentioned, the post does not explicitly state it was a ""suicide attempt"" (an action taken with the intent to die). The phrasing ""I hurt myself"" without further context of suicidal intent during that act does not meet the strict definition of 'Attempt' which focuses on *suicide attempts*. The primary current risk expressed is the desire for death, which is ideation.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire for death as an escape, which falls under ideation, and does not describe a specific plan or a past *suicide attempt* explicitly.

275,"More than anything I want help and to get better, but I can't tell anyone. I just moved out of home, I live on campus now. I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much.

I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""conversations with myself about suicide,"" ""I think about suicide every day,"" ""seriously consider it,"" ""twice as suicidal.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""want help and to get better,"" ""can't tell anyone,"" ""feel so alone,"" ""sad all the time,"" ""too much to carry alone,"" ""It's too much.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" This is a direct mention of planning.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""suicidal,"" ""suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The post states, ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" While the *specifics* of the method are not in the post, the *act* of writing ""detailed plans"" is explicitly stated. This indicates a concrete step towards planning.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Writing ""detailed plans"" is a form of preparation or a step in the planning process.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get,"" ""I write detailed plans in my journal,"" ""almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide,"" ""I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so."" This refers to current and ongoing thoughts and planning.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""suicidal,"" ""think about suicide every day""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by stating, ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The act of writing ""detailed plans"" in a journal fits the description of ""some form of explicit planning"" or ""preparations taken,"" even if the details of the plan are not shared in the post itself. This moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of past attempts, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

    Therefore, the presence of ""detailed plans"" being written down is the key element that classifies this as 'Behavior'.

276,:(. I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""The pain is unreal"" indicate severe distress, overwhelm, and suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""I can't take it anymore"" expresses extreme distress but not an explicit wish for death or to end one's life.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. In this case, it's unclear if ""can't take it anymore"" implies a desire to die, so we lean towards 'indicator'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings/intentions.
   - Past attempts are not described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses severe distress and hopelessness.
   - However, it does not explicitly mention suicide, a desire to die, or any suicidal thoughts.
   - According to the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""committing suicide"" is explicitly stated.
   - Emotional indicators: The post has a dark, sarcastic, or perhaps desperate tone, implying a twisted sense of achievement or capability related to suicide.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method (e.g., tool, location, substance), or preparation is mentioned. The post only states a perceived capability.
   - References to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""commiting suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober"" is a direct expression of a suicidal thought or consideration.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no explicit plan or method, this leans towards 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current capability and potential future intention (""I think I'm capable...""). It does not describe a past event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide,"" ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It expresses a clear suicidal thought (""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober"") but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
   - There is no specific plan or self-harming behavior mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of suicide, death, or dying. The phrase ""I just want it to be over"" is present, which could imply an end to life, but it is not explicit about suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit,"" ""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I don't want to be alone any more,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" ""I'm sick and tired and I wasn't to be down."" These indicate severe emotional distress, self-loathing, hopelessness, and a desire for current suffering to end.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post does not use words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" or ""end my life"" directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I just want it to be over"" is ambiguous. It could refer to wanting the current situation or feelings to end, rather than life itself. According to the definition, ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given this, it does not meet the explicit criteria for ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and desire for things to change (""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I just want it to be over"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a desire for an end to current suffering (""I just want it to be over"").
   - However, the definition for 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The post does not explicitly state a desire to die or to commit suicide. The phrase ""I just want it to be over"" is not explicit enough to cross the threshold from 'Indicator' to 'Ideation' given the strict rule: ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" and ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
   - There are no specific plans or methods, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category as it describes general distress without explicit suicidal intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""attempted suicide 11 times"", ""use my suicide"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I hate capitalism and everyone complicit in it."" The motivation for suicide is stated as ""to disturb people for my own satisfaction,"" which indicates a specific, albeit dark, purpose.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) or preparation is mentioned for the *future* suicide. The post states the *purpose* of the future suicide (""to disturb people"") but not the *how*.
    *   References to past attempts: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This is a clear and explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""attempted suicide"", ""my suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I will use my suicide"" implies a clear intention to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The future intention (""I will use my suicide"") lacks a specific method, so if this were the only part, it would lean towards ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" refers to past events. ""I will use my suicide"" refers to a future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""attempted suicide 11 times.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times,"" which directly matches the core definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide.""
    *   Additionally, the 'Attempt' definition includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The post mentions past attempts (""I have attempted suicide 11 times"") and also a current/future intention (""I will use my suicide to disturb people""). Even though the current intention lacks a specific method (which would make it 'Ideation' if it stood alone), the presence of past attempts combined with a current intention means 'Attempt' is the correct classification according to the rules.

I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death."" (Explicit desire/intention to die)
        *   ""I don't want my head to explode via shotgun..."" (Specific method discussed)
        *   ""...shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth."" (Specific method and location discussed)
        *   ""I've looked into other options..."" (Indicates active research/planning for methods)
        *   ""A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate."" (Discusses suicide outcomes, showing contemplation of the act)
        *   ""End it now"" (General imperative, but in context of author's despair)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""in hell,"" ""so alone,"" ""insane abandonment issues,"" ""painful feeling,"" ""sadder,"" ""terribly scared,"" ""depression and physical pain,"" ""high anxiety,"" ""It doesn't get better,"" ""never ending pain.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""how to accomplish death"" (Actively seeking a method)
        *   ""shotgun"" (Specific method)
        *   ""handguns"" (Specific method)
        *   ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth"" (Highly specific method and target location)
        *   ""small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference"" (Detailed consideration of method specifics)
        *   ""I've looked into other options"" (Direct statement of researching methods)
        *   Reference to ""Mark Linkous overdosing"" and fear of paralysis from ""failed suicide"" indicates contemplation of overdose as a method and its potential negative outcomes.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions Mark Linkous's overdose, which is a past event for *another person*, not the author. The author expresses fear of a *failed suicide* but does not state they have made a past attempt themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""how to accomplish death,"" ""don't kill yourself"" (in context of others' advice), ""A failed suicide.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"" clearly indicates a desire to die, coupled with a fear of the process.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, explicitly: shotgun, handguns, shooting through the upper palate, and discussion of overdose (in the context of fear of failure).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"" and ""I've looked into other options"" strongly suggest active research and consideration of methods, which constitutes elements of planning. The detailed discussion of specific weapons and the precise location for a shot (upper palate) goes beyond mere ideation and into the realm of concrete planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post primarily refers to current feelings and future intentions (""how to accomplish death,"" ""I don't want my head to explode,"" ""I've looked into other options""). The reference to Mark Linkous is a past event for someone else, used to illustrate the author's current fears about their own potential future actions. There is no mention of the author's own past suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond 'Ideation' because it explicitly discusses specific methods (shotgun, handgun, shooting through the upper palate, looking into other options) and details related to these methods (caliber, fear of failed overdose). This level of detail about *how* to commit suicide, and the active research (""looked into other options""), constitutes explicit planning or consideration of methods, which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not describe a past suicide attempt by the author, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The detailed exploration of specific means and the active search for methods (""how to accomplish death,"" ""looked into other options"") fits the 'Behavior' definition of ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""

282,Can't do any of it!. Just don't want this anymore just wanna sleep and never ever wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" implies a desire for an end to life or non-existence, which is a form of wanting to die. No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Can't do any of it!"", ""Just don't want this anymore"" indicate strong distress, hopelessness, and a desire for current circumstances to end.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. ""sleep and never ever wake up"" describes a desired state, not a method or plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a direct expression of wanting to cease to exist or die. The 'Ideation' definition includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". This phrase fits that description.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While ""suicide"" isn't explicitly mentioned, the desire ""to not be alive any longer"" is explicitly conveyed through ""sleep and never ever wake up"". This goes beyond vague distress or a general feeling about death, aligning with the 'Ideation' definition.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""Sleep"" is used as a euphemism for death, not a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'Indicator' because there is a direct expression of wanting to die/not be alive (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up""), which is more than general distress or a vague feeling about death. The 'Ideation' definition specifically covers ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
   - It fits 'Ideation' because it contains an explicit desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method.
   - It's not 'Behavior' because no specific plan, method, or self-harming behavior is mentioned.
   - It's not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator' which requires no explicit expression concerning suicide.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out?

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains multiple explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings: ""make me want to die?"", ""want to not exist"", ""I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over."", ""I don't want to be here"", ""I want to be done, I want to be out of this"", ""I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore."" There is also a mention of ""fighting the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now,"" which indicates a reckless disregard for safety and a passive desire for harm, but not a specific plan for self-inflicted death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of distress, anger, frustration, hopelessness (""can't see a solution or a way out?""), feeling ""done,"" ""crying,"" ""migraine making all of the feelings worse.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. The phrase ""wandering off into the night"" is vague and does not constitute a concrete suicide plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, very explicitly: ""want to die"", ""want to not exist"", ""do not want to exist anymore"", ""I almost hope something bad happens to me... It would just be over."" These are direct expressions of a desire for an end to life or existence.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""Wandering off into the night"" is not a specific method for suicide; it implies a desire for something bad to happen, but not a planned action to end one's life.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Given the lack of a specific plan, the classification should lean towards 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and intentions (""make me want to die?"", ""I want to not exist anymore""). There is no description of past suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are multiple explicit expressions of wanting to die/not exist, which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits perfectly. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" but it lacks ""any specific plan to commit suicide."" The expressions are strong and direct.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan (method, location, means) or actual self-harming behavior. The urge to ""wander off"" is not a concrete suicide plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the post does not describe any past suicide attempts.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not exist, but without a specific plan.

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it.

The definition of 'Ideation' perfectly fits: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" also applies here.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying: ""Death is an option"", ""die (not suffering)"", ""not the worst outcome"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Analytical, questioning, a degree of acceptance regarding death, but explicitly states ""I won't commit"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. Refers to ""an accident"".
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not directly as an action the person intends to take. The post asks ""Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought?"", which is a question *about* suicidal thought, not an expression *of* it.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post states ""I won't commit"" and frames accidental death as ""not the worst outcome,"" which is a passive acceptance, not an active desire to die or end one's life.
    *   ""If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'"". The explicit statement ""I won't commit"" strongly pushes this away from 'ideation' as it negates active suicidal intent. The ""Death is an option"" is then clarified by the accidental scenario, which further reduces it from an active suicidal thought.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""an accident"" is not a specific suicide method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Not applicable as there is no planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current thought process and hypothetical future (""if somehow I got an accident""). No past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""I won't commit"". While it discusses ""death as an option"" and asks if this is ""suicidal thought,"" it does not express an *explicit desire to die* or to *commit suicide*. Instead, it expresses a passive acceptance of death *if it happens accidentally and without suffering*. According to the 'Indicator' definition, ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits the 'Indicator' definition because there is no explicit desire to end one's life, and the explicit negation of committing suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""finally kill me"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I wish I didn't have to do this, but I'm doing the right after all"" (suggests resignation and a firm decision).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Tonight is the last chance"", ""Its been a year since I planned this"", ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"". These are strong indicators of a plan and preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill me"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me"".
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific tool, but ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"" explicitly states preparations have been made. ""Tonight is the last chance"" indicates a specific time. ""Its been a year since I planned this"" indicates long-term planning.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"".
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Tonight is the last chance"", ""I'm doing the right after all""). The planning has been ongoing, but the action is set for ""Tonight"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions wanting to ""kill me"".
   - It clearly states a plan (""planned this"") and preparations (""have the stuff prepared and everything"") for an imminent action (""Tonight is the last chance"").
   - This fits the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".
   - It is not 'Ideation' because there is a clear plan and preparation mentioned, not just thoughts.
   - It is not 'Attempt' as it describes current/future intent and preparation, not a past action.
   - It is not 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a plan/preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" and ""starve myself I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"". This clearly indicates suicidal intent and a method of self-harm leading to death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Idk"", ""I'm to much of a pussy"", ""I hate my body"", ""I see no reason to fuel it with energy"". These show feelings of hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I've decided to stop eating all together and starve myself"" is a clear, stated method/plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""stop eating all together and starve myself"". This is a concrete, albeit slow, method to end one's life.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I've decided to stop eating all together"" indicates a decision to implement this plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I've decided to stop eating..."", ""I hope my body breaks down..."").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress or vague thoughts of dying. It explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and a specific method (""stop eating all together and starve myself"").
    *   This eliminates 'Indicator' (which lacks explicit suicide mention) and 'Ideation' (which lacks a specific plan).
    *   The presence of a specific method/plan (""starve myself"") fits the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method"".
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch. In my past I've had everything that made me who I am stripped away from my character time and time again. It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive.

Much love to anyone reading ❤️",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of suicide, death, or dying. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is present, but it's vague and negated (""don't always wish""), not a direct expression of wanting to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness."" These clearly indicate distress, despair, and emotional pain.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: No. The post mentions past difficult experiences (""dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""stripped away from my character"") but not past suicide *attempts*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is not a direct or explicit expression of wanting to die. It implies that sometimes the thought might cross their mind, but it's not a clear statement of desire to end their life. According to the definition, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Also, ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past difficult experiences and current feelings of loneliness and confusion. There is no mention of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and loneliness.
   - However, it lacks any *explicit* mention of suicide or a direct desire to die. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is too vague and indirect to qualify as explicit suicidal ideation based on the provided definitions.
   - There are no plans, methods, or preparations, nor any description of past suicide attempts.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide.

Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I just slit my wrists,"" which is a direct description of self-harm. It also mentions ""my death will only benefit people,"" ""I just want to get it over with,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late,"" and ""I wont have much time to live,"" all indicating suicidal intent and the belief that death has occurred or is imminent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I have been so distant to everyone in my life and i am not a good person,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" show feelings of self-worthlessness and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details the method: ""Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines,"" and preparation: ""I looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is. i marked where the my artery should be."" Crucially, it states ""I just slit my wrists,"" indicating the action has *already been performed*.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes the *current* action as having just happened, not a past attempt from a longer time ago. ""It took me years to decide this"" refers to the decision-making process, not a prior attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of the act (""slit my wrists"") and the clear intent to die (""my death will only benefit people,"" ""it's already too late"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to get it over with,"" ""I wont have much time to live.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slit my wrists,"" using a ""dremel and put the saw atachment on,"" targeting the ""radial artery.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is. i marked where the my artery should be.""
    *   The post describes an action that has *already occurred* (""I just slit my wrists"") using a detailed method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""I just slit my wrists"" clearly indicates an action that has *just happened*, meaning it is a completed action in the immediate past. ""If you are seeing this then its already too late"" reinforces that the action is done.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the post describes an action that has *already happened* (""I just slit my wrists""). While ""just"" implies very recent, it is still a concrete action that has occurred in the past relative to the time of posting.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect, as suicide/self-harm is explicitly mentioned and described.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect, as it goes beyond thoughts/desires and describes a concrete action.
    *   **Behavior:** The definition states ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" While it describes self-harming behavior, the crucial temporal aspect of ""I just slit my wrists"" points more strongly to 'Attempt'.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition states ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The phrase ""I just slit my wrists"" describes a concrete action that has *already happened* (even if very recently). It is a ""historic action"" in the context of the post, not a current plan for the future. The post is a report of an action that has been completed. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' most accurately.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I wanted to die when I made that post"", ""I just don't want to die"" (which, in context with ""no hope"" and ""meaningless torture"", implies a desire for the suffering to end, a common aspect of suicidal ideation). ""meaningless torture"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""hopelessness"", ""desperate"", ""dark moment"", ""feel like breaking"", ""no hope"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The ""draft"" mentioned was for ""reaching out for some help"" and ""stating my hopelessness"", not a suicide plan.
   - References to past attempts: No. The phrase ""I wanted to die when I made that post"" refers to a past *feeling* or *thought*, not a past *action* or *attempt*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through expressions like ""I wanted to die"" and the overall context of despair and ""meaningless torture.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wanted to die when I made that post."" While ""I just don't want to die"" might seem contradictory, in the context of ""I have no hope"" and ""meaningless torture,"" it reflects a conflict or a desire for the pain to cease, which is consistent with ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The ""draft"" was for seeking help, not for a suicide plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to both past feelings (""I wanted to die when I made that post"") and current, ongoing feelings of hopelessness and despair (""I don't know what to do"", ""everything always seems like a gamble"", ""I just feel like breaking"", ""it all just feels like meaningless torture right now"", ""I have no hope""). The core of the post is about current distress and a desire for the suffering to end, without a specific plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post describes past *thoughts/feelings* (""I wanted to die when I made that post""), not a past *concrete action* or *attempt*.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as the post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and strong suicidal thoughts/feelings (""I wanted to die"", ""no hope"", ""meaningless torture"") but no specific plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself"", ""fear of death"", ""scared to die"", ""emptiness after death"", ""hope that I don't wake up"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I hate it"", ""scared"", ""cry myself to sleep"", ""neverending cycle"", ""I'm done"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a desire for the situation to end.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""my parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of."" This indicates that means were considered or available but have been removed by others. The user states ""I could do it right now"" but immediately follows with ""The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die"". There is no specific method, tool, location, or preparation mentioned by the user themselves.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death"", ""hope that I don't wake up"", ""I'm done"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post mentions parents removing means, but the user does not state a current specific method or plan they intend to use. The phrase ""I could do it right now"" is an expression of capability, not a specific plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current feelings and intentions (""The only thing preventing me..."", ""I could do it right now"", ""I'm done""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"", ""hope that I don't wake up"") and a strong desire to not be alive. However, it does not describe a specific plan, method, or preparations being taken by the user. The mention of parents removing means indicates a *lack* of a current specific plan or means for the user. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan. It is not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described. It is not 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""desperate,"" ""extraordinarily painful.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""my letters were written,"" ""I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.""
    *   References to past attempts: The post describes being ""days away from going through with"" a plan, implying it was not executed. It explicitly states, ""I'm still here and I made the decision to live. I keep living past that date."" This confirms the past plan was not an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the past context (""desperate,"" ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? A ""set plan"" is mentioned, and ""letters were written"" as preparation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""letters were written.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The suicidal thoughts, plan, and preparations are explicitly described as past events (""I came extraordinarily close..."", ""I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with""). The current intention is to live (""I'm still here and I made the decision to live."").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there were specific plans/preparations.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post describes a ""set plan"" and ""letters were written,"" which goes beyond mere thoughts or vague desires to not be alive.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The definition for 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened in the past. The post states the user was ""days away from going through with"" the plan and ""keep living past that date,"" meaning no concrete action (attempt) occurred. It describes being on the verge of an attempt, not an actual attempt.
    *   **Behavior:** This category states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" The post *does* describe a past state where there were explicit suicidal thoughts (""came extraordinarily close to killing myself"") and a ""set plan"" with ""letters written"" (preparations). While the current state is positive, the content *describes* past elements that fit the 'Behavior' definition (having a plan and preparations), even if it was not executed and is now in the past. The definition does not explicitly limit 'Behavior' to *current* plans, and the post is detailing past actions/preparations related to suicide.

Based on the analysis, the post describes past suicidal planning and preparations, which aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, even though it was not an executed attempt and the current state is positive.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""not doing it years ago"" (implying suicide), ""wished I wasn't alive"", ""wanted things to be over"", ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it"", ""so that I didn't have to live through everything since then and that I wouldn't be here now"". The phrase ""it"" clearly refers to ending one's life in context.
   - Emotional indicators: ""angry at myself"", ""wished I wasn't alive"", ""wanted things to be over"", ""angry that it would be considered selfish"". These indicate strong feelings of despair, regret, and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: The post mentions ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it"". This indicates a regret about *not* having committed suicide in the past, rather than a description of a past *actual attempt*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it"", which in context clearly refer to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wished I wasn't alive"", ""wanted things to be over"", ""wouldn't be here now"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past *thoughts* and *desires* (""since about 2012"") and a current feeling of regret about *not* having acted on those thoughts in the past (""wish that I had just done it""). It also expresses a current desire to not be alive (""wouldn't be here now""). There are no current plans. The focus is on past ideation and current regret about not having acted on it, coupled with ongoing desire to not be alive.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit mentions of wanting to die/not be alive and references to suicide.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post describes *not* having done it (""not doing it years ago"", ""wish that I had just done it the first time""). It's a regret about *missed opportunities* for suicide in the past, not a description of a past *actual attempt*. The definition for 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened in the past.
   - 'Ideation' fits best: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""wished I wasn't alive"", ""wanted things to be over"", ""wish that I had just done it""), but without any specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal"", ""wanting to die"", ""killing myself"", ""dead"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed"", ""It sucks so much"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a clear preparation (suicide note, distribution of belongings). The user also states ""there are times where i just get ready to die"".
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past *attempts*. The note is a preparation for a future act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"", ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""still wanting to die"", ""just get ready to die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the writing of a suicide note and planning for administrative tasks before death are clear signs of preparation. The 'Behavior' definition explicitly lists ""suicide note"" as a form of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and preparations for a future act (""get ready to die""). The note has been written, indicating an ongoing state of preparation. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""Ideation"").
   - However, it goes beyond mere thoughts by describing a concrete preparation: ""I have past the point where i have written a note"". The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"". This perfectly matches the post.
   - It does not describe a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - It is far more explicit than 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""ive never been more suicidal in my life.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""I fucked up yesterday,"" ""got in trouble woth my family,"" ""never been more suicidal"" indicate high distress, regret, and an extreme low emotional state.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal"" is a direct mention.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""never been more suicidal"" strongly implies a desire or inclination towards ending one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""ive never been more suicidal in my life"" indicates a current, intense feeling. The preceding events (""fucked up yesterday,"" ""trespassed,"" ""fought,"" ""got in trouble"") are past, but they are presented as the cause of the *current* suicidal feeling.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide, which rules out 'Behavior'. The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""

We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post uses strong negative language (""Auschwitz,"" ""prison colony,"" ""fascist regime,"" ""slaves"") to describe Australia and its government, comparing it to historical atrocities and expressing a feeling of oppression and lack of freedom.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong negative emotions, anger, paranoia, feeling dehumanized and controlled. However, these are directed externally at a perceived oppressive system, not internally as a desire to end one's own life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses extreme dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs and a feeling of being enslaved, but not a personal desire to die or end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current perceived societal/political conditions. There is no mention of past events related to suicide or future suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains no explicit or implicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or a desire to die.
   - While there is significant distress and negative sentiment, it is focused on a perceived external oppressive system rather than internal suicidal thoughts.
   - According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post expresses extreme dissatisfaction with a country/regime, but it does not cross the threshold into suicidal ideation.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category as it lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide.

   - There is no mention of a specific plan (e.g., a method, location, or means) or any preparation, which would be required for 'Behavior'.

They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""I'm suicidal myself."" It also mentions ""multiple suicide attempts"" by the poster in the past (""there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking""). The post heavily discusses the friend's suicidal ideation and attempts, but the classification must only correspond to the person writing the post.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""confused,"" ""breakdown,"" ""This fucking sucks.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans or methods are mentioned for the *poster's own* suicidal thoughts or actions.
    *   References to past attempts: Yes, ""multiple suicide attempts since we started talking"" refers to the poster's own past actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm suicidal myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm suicidal myself"" implies this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the poster's own current state or past attempts.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both: ""I'm suicidal myself"" (current state) and ""multiple suicide attempts since we started talking"" (past events for the poster).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""multiple suicide attempts since we started talking"" for the poster.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I'm suicidal myself,"" which indicates 'Ideation'.
    *   However, it also clearly states, ""there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking,"" referring to the *poster's own* past actions.
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While ""I'm suicidal myself"" isn't a ""current plan,"" it is a current suicidal state/feeling. The presence of explicit past attempts by the poster, combined with current suicidal feelings, aligns with the 'Attempt' definition's nuance.
    *   Since the post describes concrete past actions of the poster attempting suicide, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate category.

   - Emotional indicators: ""Please!"", ""I beg you"", ""end my pain"" (indicating severe distress and despair).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Just kill me"" and ""end my life"" are direct and explicit expressions of a desire for death/suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post expresses a desire to die but no ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions/desires.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""Just kill me"", ""end my life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""end my own life,"" ""suicide,"" and ""killing myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""anger issues,"" ""caused hurt,"" ""emotional pain,"" ""numbers dwindle by the day,"" ""cry for help.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method (e.g., tool, location, substance), or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned. The post focuses on the *logic* and *decision* to end life.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""end my own life,"" ""suicide,"" ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the entire post revolves around the utilitarian logic for ending one's existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post is a philosophical deliberation about the *decision* to end life, not the *how*.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""for me to end my own life,"" ""future people,"" ""future existence,"" ""killing myself is not the right thing to do""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there's a clear desire to end life.
   - **Ideation:** This fits perfectly. The post ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The user is expressing a desire to end their life based on their logic, but no method or plan is provided.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. The definition clearly states, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" In this case, there is no plan at all.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because the post does not describe any past suicide attempts.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life without detailing any specific plan or past attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""my thoughts always just come back to this,"" ""end it all,"" ""if we don't want to be here."" The phrase ""end it all"" is a clear euphemism for suicide. The mention of a ""gun which would solve everything"" directly implies suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm so tired,"" ""won't ever be happy,"" ""Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly mentions a ""gun"" as a desired method that ""would solve everything."" It also states, ""I'm from the UK, so i can't get hold of a gun,"" indicating a specific method is considered, even if currently inaccessible. The question ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" is an active inquiry about finding a method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end it all"" and the direct reference to a gun that ""would solve everything"" in the context of wanting to cease existing.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""if we don't want to be here,"" and the desire for an option to ""end it all.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""gun"" is mentioned as a desired method. The user also explicitly asks for ""a good option for us to end it all,"" indicating an active search for a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note), but the active consideration and search for a specific method (gun) and other ""options"" constitutes a form of planning/seeking means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions and desires. The language used (""I don't want it anymore,"" ""my thoughts always just come back to this,"" ""won't ever be happy,"" ""Why isn't there a good option..."") indicates present and future-oriented thoughts and desires.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""end it all,"" ""don't want to be here""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""gun"") and actively seeking ""a good option for us to end it all."" While the gun is stated as inaccessible, the *desire* for that specific method and the active search for *any* ""good option"" constitutes a form of explicit planning or seeking means, which aligns with the 'Behavior' definition. The definition of 'Behavior' states it ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method."" The mention of a gun as a solution, and the active questioning about other ""options"" to ""end it all,"" fits this criterion.
    *   There is no description of past attempts, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Based on the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and the discussion/search for specific methods, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself.

   - Emotional indicators: ""dislike it,"" ""disappointed in myself,"" ""hate it,"" ""disgusted,"" ""hateful I felt towards myself,"" ""ugly I felt,"" ""Terrible feeling."" These indicate significant emotional distress, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) for suicide are mentioned. The act of masturbating to the thought of killing oneself is described as a coping mechanism for distress, not a plan to commit suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""wanting to kill myself"").
   - It does not describe any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
   - It does not describe a past suicide attempt, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
   - It goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death by explicitly mentioning ""killing myself,"" which differentiates it from 'Indicator'.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times, ""die prematurely"", ""end my life"", and ""wanting to end my life"".
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses deep personal conviction, frustration with societal views, a sense of being unheard (""No one is really listening to any of us"", ""There is no support""), and a desire for escape.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. The post discusses the *concept* of suicide as a solution and a personal desire, but not *how* it would be carried out.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""self harm"" and describes a past incident where the user ""used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain"" by cutting their arm, leading to their girlfriend ""freaking out"" and resulting in ""a dozen scars."" This is a clear description of past self-harming behavior. The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" indicates current feelings of hopelessness and questioning the value of life. There's also a mention of someone encouraging the girlfriend to ""kill herself,"" but this is not about the poster.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired"", ""in pain"", ""numb and empty inside"", ""cried myself to sleep"", ""wonder if it's even worth it anymore."" These indicate significant emotional distress, despair, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No current plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned by the poster. The self-harm described is a past event.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, the post describes a specific past incident: ""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."" This is a concrete past action of self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not directly by the poster regarding themselves.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression of wanting to die. ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is an indirect expression of questioning life's value, which is close to ideation but not an explicit ""I want to die.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The past action is more significant than this phrase for classification.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No *current* methods or plans for suicide are mentioned. The past self-harm involved cutting (""saw my arm"", ""scars"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No *current* signs of preparation for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily describes a past self-harm incident (""A few months ago..."") and its ongoing emotional impact. The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" refers to current, ongoing feelings.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a concrete past act of self-harm is described. The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The cutting described fits this. While the stated intent was ""to relieve some of the pain,"" serious self-harm is often considered a form of suicide attempt or a high-risk behavior in suicide assessment, especially when coupled with feelings of life not being worth it.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Too low. The post describes a concrete past act of self-harm and current significant distress.
    *   **Ideation:** The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is close, but not an *explicit* desire to not be alive as required by the definition. The primary focus is on the past action.
    *   **Behavior:** The definition states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts *and* also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" The post does not have *current* explicit suicidal thoughts or plans. While it describes past self-harm, the ""and also"" conjunction means it doesn't fit 'Behavior' for current risk.
    *   **Attempt:** The post clearly describes a ""concrete action"" of self-harm in the past (""used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out...Btw theres about a dozen scars""). This fits the ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"" part of the 'Attempt' definition. While the explicit suicidal *intent* for that past act isn't stated as ""to die,"" in the context of suicide risk classification, a serious past self-harm incident is often considered an attempt, especially given the current questioning of life's worth. This category is for ""historic actions rather than current plans."" This is the most fitting category given the detailed description of a past serious self-harm incident.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** ""I hope I die soon."", ""Soon I will be finally dead.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, anger, resentment (""Fuck that"", ""Fuck them!"", ""They will pay for how they made me feel!"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily."" While not explicitly stating ""I will overdose on heroin to die,"" the daily use of a lethal substance, immediately following ""I hope I die soon"" and preceding ""Soon I will be finally dead,"" strongly implies this is the chosen method or an ongoing self-harming behavior leading to death. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""lethal medication/drugs"" as a specific method and ""exhibits self-harming behavior."" Daily heroin use fits both.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hope I die soon."", ""Soon I will be finally dead.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""started to do heroin pretty much daily."" This is a ""lethal medication/drug"" and an ""exhibit of self-harming behavior"" as per the 'Behavior' definition. The context links this ongoing behavior directly to the desire for death.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The daily use of heroin can be considered an ongoing preparation or execution of a self-destructive plan.
    *   Given the explicit desire to die and the active, ongoing use of a lethal substance (heroin), this goes beyond mere ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to current/future intentions (""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead""). The heroin use is current and ongoing (""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily"").
    *   No past suicide attempts described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit expressions of wanting to die.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is not just a desire to die, but also an active, ongoing behavior (daily heroin use) that serves as a potential method or self-harming behavior explicitly linked to the desire for death.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead"") and mentions a specific, ongoing ""self-harming behavior"" (daily heroin use) using ""lethal medication/drugs"" which is presented in a context that implies it is the means to achieve the desired death.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past suicide attempt is described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem"" is a direct and explicit inquiry about a method to cause death, specifically suicide by gunshot.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things."" This indicates a profound sense of hopelessness, detachment, and a strong desire to end one's life, dismissing common protective factors.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The mention of a ""gun"" and asking for the ""best position... for hitting the brain stem"" indicates a specific method (gunshot) and a detailed inquiry about its execution, which points towards planning or preparation.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, by asking about the optimal way to use a gun to hit the brain stem, the intent to commit suicide is clearly expressed.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the dismissal of reasons to live (""I genuinely do not care for any of those things"") strongly implies a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""gun"" is explicitly mentioned as the means.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Asking for precise technical details (""What position... is best for hitting the brain stem"") about how to effectively use the method is a strong sign of active planning or preparation.
    *   This goes beyond vague ideation; it's an inquiry into the practical execution of a specific method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The question is posed in the present, seeking information for a potential future action.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a clear mention of a specific method (gun) and an inquiry about its effective execution (""best position... for hitting the brain stem""). This level of detail about the method and its application fits the definition of 'Behavior' (""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ...tools/weapons (e.g. guns) suitable to end ones life...)""). It is more than just ideation because a specific method is identified and details about its use are sought. It is not an attempt as no past action is described. It is not an indicator as suicide is explicitly mentioned and a plan is being inquired about.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thought about killing myself"", ""self harm scars"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""everything just keeps getting worse"", ""nothing to be upset over and i'm dramatic"" (implies feelings of invalidation, hopelessness, despair).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for suicide. The ""self harm scars"" refer to past self-harm, not a current suicide plan.
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit mention of a past *suicide attempt*. ""Self harm scars"" indicate past self-harm, which is distinct from a suicide attempt unless explicitly stated as such.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post mentions ""self harm scars,"" which indicates past self-harm, but this is not a current *suicide plan* or *suicide behavior*. The definition for ""Behavior"" requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" This is absent for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head."" - Refers to current and ongoing suicidal thoughts.
    *   ""my mum saw my self harm scars"" - Refers to a past event (the scars themselves are from past self-harm).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no explicit plan, method, or preparation for suicide mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'. The self-harm scars refer to past self-harm, not a current suicide plan.
    *   The post does not describe a past *suicide attempt* (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried to jump""). It mentions ""self harm scars,"" which is different from a suicide attempt. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not suitable.
    *   The post clearly states ""thought about killing myself"" and ""it wont leave my head,"" which are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. This perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself"", ""my only way out is killing myself"", ""Let's just do it"", ""I'm sick of life"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what the fuck to do anymore"", ""I still feel like trash"", ""sick of life"" indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Let's just do it"" expresses intent but not a concrete plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing myself"" is a direct and explicit mention.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""my only way out is killing myself"", ""I'm sick of life"", ""Let's just do it"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post expresses a strong intent (""Let's just do it"") but lacks any specific details about *how* the suicide would be carried out (e.g., ""I'm going to jump off the bridge,"" ""I'm taking all my pills""). According to the rules, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (""my only way out is killing myself"", ""Let's just do it""). There is no mention of past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The phrase ""Let's just do it"" indicates intent but not a concrete plan as required by the 'Behavior' definition.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
   - This fits the 'Ideation' definition perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post clearly expresses a strong desire to end life without detailing a specific method or preparation.

My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better. I am not fighting anymore because I give up. I give up fighting for a body that I don't want to live in anymore. I am living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that wants to die. My body has lost the fight and my mind has won. Goodbye.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I'm going to attempt again,"" ""I've tried to overdose three times,"" ""I want to die,"" ""my first attempt,"" ""a mind that wants to die,"" and ends with ""Goodbye."" These are direct and unambiguous references to suicide and self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""so tired,"" ""hate every little thing about myself,"" ""terrifying,"" ""pain,"" ""loneliness,"" ""feel like shit,"" ""give up,"" ""don't want to live in anymore."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""overdose"" as a past method. The phrase ""Just a few more hours... I'm going to attempt again"" indicates a clear, time-bound intention to act, implying a plan or preparation is in place or imminent. The ""Goodbye"" also suggests a final preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post explicitly states ""I've tried to overdose three times"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""attempt again,"" ""overdose,"" ""first attempt"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to die,"" ""a mind that wants to die,"" ""I don't want to live in anymore"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose"" is mentioned as a past method. The intention to ""attempt again"" strongly implies a concrete method will be used, likely similar to past attempts.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the specific timeframe ""Just a few more hours"" and the farewell ""Goodbye"" indicate immediate intent and preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both.
        *   Past events: ""I've tried to overdose three times,"" ""my first attempt.""
        *   Current/future intentions: ""Just a few more hours... I'm going to attempt again.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""overdose three times"" and ""first attempt at the beginning of this year.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes multiple past suicide attempts (""I've tried to overdose three times,"" ""my first attempt""). This aligns directly with the 'Attempt' category definition.
    *   Furthermore, the 'Attempt' definition states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post explicitly refers to past attempts AND states a current, time-bound plan to ""attempt again"" in ""Just a few more hours.""
    *   This combination makes 'Attempt' the most accurate and comprehensive classification, as it covers both the historical actions and the immediate, concrete future intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I just want this pain to end."" This is a strong expression of distress and a desire for suffering to cease. However, it does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""dying,"" or ""killing myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of despair, hopelessness, exhaustion (""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore""), guilt, isolation, and a sense of being trapped. The user lists numerous traumatic and stressful life events.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The word ""suicide"" or direct phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" are not present.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" implies a desire for cessation of suffering, which *could* be interpreted as a desire to not be alive. However, the definition for 'indicator' states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given this strict rule, ""I just want this pain to end"" is not explicit enough to be classified as 'ideation'. It falls under ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness"" where suicide/killing oneself is not explicitly mentioned.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and intentions (""I can't anymore,"" ""I just want this pain to end"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound distress and a desire for pain to end, but it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive* as per the strict definition required for 'ideation'. The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" is not considered explicit enough based on the provided guidelines (""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or self-harming behavior, ruling out 'behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, based on the strict interpretation of the definitions, particularly the requirement for *explicit* mention for 'ideation', this post falls into the 'indicator' category.

I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am.

I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry.

In this case, there is no explicit method/means/location.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions (""at 30 or 25"", ""over the course of the passing years"", ""by the time im around that age"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no specific method, means, or preparation mentioned, only a conditional future timeframe.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it refers to future intentions, not past actions.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but without a specific plan (method, means, location).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""suicide rate"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" indicates a state of distress or being close to a breaking point. The user expresses feeling ""perceived as male and a threat,"" which is a source of distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used in ""suicide rate.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses the *concept* of suicide rates in relation to a social issue and expresses general distress (""teetering on the edge""). It does not state a personal desire to die or not be alive. The ""teetering on the edge"" is a metaphor for general distress, not a direct suicidal thought.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The mention of ""suicide"" is in a statistical context, not a personal expression of suicidal ideation. The definition of 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is not present.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" refers to a current or recent state of distress. The reflection on suicide rates is a current thought. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains general expressions of distress (""teetering on the edge lately"") but lacks any explicit expression of a *personal* desire to die or suicidal thoughts.
   - While the word ""suicide"" is present (""suicide rate""), it is used in a factual/observational context about a demographic statistic, not as an indication of the user's own suicidal ideation.
   - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - The post fits the 'Indicator' category because it expresses general distress and discusses the topic of suicide rates, but does not explicitly state a personal suicidal thought or desire to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide is a coward way to go out"", ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours."" The phrase ""gone within 24 hours"" strongly implies ending one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: Sarcasm (""Thanks mom.""), despair, sadness ("":(""), and a sense of finality (""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling."").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A timeframe (""within 24 hours"") is given, but no specific method (e.g., how they will be gone, what means they will use) or preparations are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide is a coward way to go out"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" is a direct expression of intent to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations are mentioned, only a timeframe.
   - The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)"". While the timeframe indicates urgency, it lacks the specificity of a method or preparation needed for 'Behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear expression of intent to die.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it refers to future intent, not a past completed action.
   - Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""gone within 24 hours""). However, it lacks a specific plan, method, or concrete preparations (e.g., ""I'm going to jump off the bridge,"" ""I'm taking all my pills""). The timeframe alone, without a method, does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation'.

331,"Abused as a child. I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I don't have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""it's killing me"" is used, which is a metaphorical expression of extreme distress, not a literal statement of suicidal intent or desire to die. There's a mention of parents threatening ""my safety and possibly even my life,"" but this is a threat *from* others, not a self-directed suicidal thought.
   - Emotional indicators: High levels of distress, hopelessness, feeling trapped, self-hatred (""I hate myself""), despair, and powerlessness are evident.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is figurative.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes past abuse and current ongoing distress and a feeling of being trapped. There are no references to past suicide attempts or current/future suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly indicates significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped. However, it *lacks any explicit mention* of suicide, wanting to die, or suicidal thoughts. The definition for 'indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die, despite the high level of distress, it falls into the 'indicator' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""self harm"", ""harming"", ""bloodying myself up"", ""kill myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""every little problem, every panic attack"", ""What the hell makes them think this won't end badly.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method for *suicide* is mentioned (e.g., specific tool, location). However, ""I'm bloodying myself up now"" indicates current self-harming behavior. ""I should do it now and save time"" indicates an immediate desire to act on suicidal thoughts, but not a concrete plan with means.
    *   References to past attempts: The post mentions a history of self-harm (""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend... I'm self harming again""), but not a past *suicide attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? For *suicide*, no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, weapon) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations for *suicide* are mentioned.
    *   However, the post explicitly states ""I'm bloodying myself up now,"" which is a clear description of *current self-harming behavior*. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past self-harm (""I've been four months without self harm""), current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now""), and current/future suicidal intention (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Past *self-harm* is described, but not a past *suicide attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"", ""should do it now""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly describes *current self-harming behavior* (""I'm bloodying myself up now"").
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide *or exhibits self-harming behavior*.""
    *   Since both explicit suicidal thoughts and exhibited self-harming behavior are present, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category, despite the lack of a specific *suicide* plan. The self-harm itself is a behavior that falls under this category's definition.
    *   'Ideation' is for explicit suicidal thoughts *without* a specific plan *or* self-harming behavior. Since self-harming behavior is present, 'Behavior' is more appropriate.
    *   'Attempt' is for past suicide attempts, which is not described here.

I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""someone blow my head off"", ""im fucking done"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""im fucking done"", ""tired if these stupidass ignorant people"", ""i still have a conscience"" (suggests internal conflict/distress). Strong feelings of despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""blow my head off"" implies a method, but it's phrased as a request for *someone else* to do it (""someone blow my head off"", ""please kill me""). There are no mentions of the user acquiring means or making preparations themselves.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""someone blow my head off"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me"" are all explicit expressions of a desire for death/suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my head off"" is a method. However, it's presented as a plea to others (""someone blow my head off"", ""please kill me"") rather than a personal plan of action by the user.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The key here is whether the *user* has an explicit plan. While a method is mentioned, the *action* is requested from others, not stated as something the user will do. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Given the phrasing, it leans more towards a strong desire for death with a suggested method, but not a concrete plan *by the user*.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""someone blow my head off"", ""please kill me""). Not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""someone blow my head off"", ""deserve death"", ""please kill me""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no description of past attempts, so 'Attempt' is ruled out.
   - The distinction between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' is crucial. 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior"" and ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". While a method (""blow my head off"") is mentioned, it's framed as a request for *someone else* to act, not a plan *by the user* to execute. There are no signs of personal preparation. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The desire is strong and explicit, but a concrete plan *by the user* is not present.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""cut my life short"", ""ended my life"". These are direct expressions of ending one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""very anxious"", ""no plan post graduation"", ""can't keep a job for extended period times of time"", ""struggle to pay for my rent utilities food etc"", ""won't work out long term"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. ""cut my life short"" is a general phrase for ending life, not a specific method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life"" are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrasing ""My only option is to cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now this wouldn't be a problem"" clearly indicate a desire to not be alive as a solution to problems.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. There is no mention of tools, locations, or substances.

I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"".

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the post details the overdose attempt from ""Yesterday"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly describes concrete past actions taken with the intent to die (""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"", and specifically the overdose ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"").
   - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, despair, and a feeling of being trapped. Phrases like ""horrible life,"" ""life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" ""bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life,"" ""no way out,"" and ""I have nothing"" clearly indicate severe emotional pain and dissatisfaction.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. While the post conveys extreme misery and a sense of being trapped (""no way out""), it does not contain direct statements like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't alive,"" or ""I want to end my life."" The phrase ""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse"" is a general statement about life, not a direct expression of the poster's desire to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Given the absence of explicit desire to die, this leans heavily towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Not applicable as there is no ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and past experiences that contribute to the current state of despair. There are no future intentions related to suicide.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness.""

I have been through SO MUCH and even just one thing is so twisted and brutal that .my whole story is just too much for anyone to hear . I really don't think I have anyone except my two friends I have known for a decade . One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted.and my mom, I also have my mom. There is someone I love deeply but I am pretty sure they want nothing to do with me and honestly.all the pain I have gone through is nothing compared to the pain I feel now for knowing I fucked up something good with someone I love. No I do not want someone else or meet someone new. My heart is too tired and fragile. This person I love knows me.after them. I really do not want anyone. And I was doing better but my living situation. And all the accumulated trauma. And getting no justice at all. Amd seeing the people who fucked me up get their happily ever after and I am left wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink. I do not want to hurt the few people who love me or even the person I love .but i really do think nobody would care.and my death would make many happy probably. I just want to know how not to be a coward and jump away when I see it approaching. I really do not want to do this . But I know this is all I have left. How do I stay on the tracks? I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks. But when I see it, I panic and jump away and start crying. Help?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""end it"", ""suicide ideation"", ""wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"", ""my death would make many happy"", ""How do I stay on the tracks?"", ""jump away when I see it approaching"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Coward"", ""up against a wall and rock"", ""SO MUCH"", ""twisted and brutal"", ""too much for anyone to hear"", ""heart is too tired and fragile"", ""pain I feel now"", ""panic and jump away and start crying"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I know the way I will end it."" (general statement), but then specifies ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"", ""I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks."" This indicates a specific method, location, and knowledge/proximity. The repeated phrase ""How do I stay on the tracks?"" and ""jump away when I see it approaching"" suggests an ongoing struggle with executing this specific plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute."" (aborted attempts). ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" (explicit past attempt).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide ideation"", ""end it"", ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"", ""my death"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I know the way I will end it."", ""I really do not want to do this . But I know this is all I have left.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks."" This shows knowledge of the means and proximity to the location. The user is actively thinking about *how* to overcome their fear to execute this specific plan (""How do I stay on the tracks?"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post refers to both past events and current/future intentions.
        *   Past events: ""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute."" and ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted.""
        *   Current/future intentions: ""I know the way I will end it."", ""I am left wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink."", ""How do I stay on the tracks?"", ""I just want to know how not to be a coward and jump away when I see it approaching."" This indicates a current, active struggle with a specific plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It includes a specific plan/method (""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"" with details about location/knowledge), which would typically lead to 'behavior'.
    *   Crucially, the post also explicitly describes a *past attempt* (""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."")
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   Since the post contains both a clear description of a past attempt and current specific planning/intent, 'attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""People tell me I'm a burden"" indicates feelings of worthlessness, self-blame, and likely deep sadness or despair due to a long-term state of social isolation and lack of personal progress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post describes a state of severe distress and social withdrawal, but does not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes a current, ongoing situation and past experiences (""I haven't left the house since I was 14""). There is no mention of past suicide attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden, which are general indicators of mental health struggles. However, it completely lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This perfectly matches the content.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts by including a specific time (""graduation night"") and a specific method (""stick some knives through my stomach""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', which requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by)."" The mention of ""knives"" as a tool and ""graduation night"" as a specific time for the plan fits this definition.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The key distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Ideation' is explicit thoughts without a specific plan. 'Behavior' includes explicit thoughts *and* mentions a plan or exhibits self-harming behavior, including ""preparations taken"".
   - While a specific method isn't named, the phrases ""looking into my options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"" clearly signify active steps towards planning and preparation for suicide. This fits the ""preparations taken"" aspect of the 'Behavior' definition. The individual is not just thinking about it, but actively moving towards executing a plan.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life"": This describes a specific method (""knife"") and a preparatory action (""to my wrist""), even if the final act of cutting was not completed. The 'Behavior' definition includes ""preparations taken (e.g. ...tools/weapons (e.g. knives...) suitable to end ones life)"". This fits.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut.""

    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method/tool and past preparatory actions.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   The past actions involving the knife are ""preparations taken"" as per the 'Behavior' definition, not a completed 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** No, suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts and intent.
    *   **Ideation:** The post goes beyond mere ideation. While there are explicit suicidal thoughts, there is also mention of a specific method (""knife to my wrist"") and past actions of preparation related to that method. The 'Ideation' definition states ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This post *does* mention a specific method/tool and past preparatory actions, which constitutes a form of planning/behavior.
    *   **Behavior:** This category states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior.

        *   Mentions a plan/method/preparations: Yes, ""had a knife to my wrist 3x"" with a ""knife"" fits ""tools/weapons (e.g. knives)"" and ""preparations taken."" This is a clear indication of a specific method and past actions towards it, combined with current intent.
    *   **Attempt:** No, because the post explicitly states ""I couldn't cut."" This means a ""concrete action"" of self-harm/suicide (e.g., an overdose, a cut) did not happen. The actions described were preparatory behaviors, not completed attempts.

    The combination of explicit suicidal thoughts (""I feel like I just need to do it"") with the mention of a specific method/tool (""knife"") and past preparatory actions (""had a knife to my wrist 3x"") strongly aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions...a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" The act of putting a knife to one's wrist, even without cutting, can be considered a self-harming behavior or preparation.

I feel unwanted and I don't have anywhere else to go, I can't tell if they hate me or I'm overthinking but all I know is that I'll never receive the attention or commitment that I give to anyone. I can't tell anyone how I'm actually feeling because I know that it would push them away and they couldn't help in the first place. I've always had a solution to my issues when I was younger, like putting a bandaid on a scratch or finding a way to get out of detention. Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide. You can't fix that shit.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

348,"To anyone that might read this. During lockdown here in Denmark, we had a long winter. I've always felt I've never done what I set out to do and never really connected with people. The lockdown and cold winter put everything that much more true. I've never felt as alone as I did there. I was very depressed, bored and lots of anxiety. Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write. Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much. For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace?"", ""It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal"", and ""For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed, bored and lots of anxiety"", ""Couldn't sleep"", ""never felt as alone"", ""thoughts scared me"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The author states, ""Never really thought I would act it out.""
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are described. The author explicitly states they *didn't* act it out.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""on the verge on becoming suicidal"", ""suicidal thoughts"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace?"".
   - Conclusion: Explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire not to be alive are present.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Conclusion: No plan or method is identified.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes past feelings and thoughts during a lockdown (""During lockdown here in Denmark..."", ""At some point my thoughts came..."", ""It made me realize I was on the verge...""). It's a reflection on past ideation, not a current intention or a past attempt. The phrase ""Never really thought I would act it out"" confirms it remained at the thought level.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and a desire not to be alive.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The author explicitly states they ""never really thought I would act it out.""
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post describes past *thoughts* and *feelings* (""on the verge on becoming suicidal""), not a concrete past action or attempt. The definition of 'attempt' requires a concrete action to have happened.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post describes past explicit suicidal thoughts without any plan or action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end myself"", ""end it"", ""overdose"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""really depressed and sad atm"", ""crying basically all night and now this morning"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""try to overdose"" (method), ""tonight"" (temporal plan).
   - References to past attempts: ""end myself again"", ""end it tonight again"". This explicitly indicates past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""end myself"" and ""overdose"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I think i'm gonna try to end myself"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The intent to ""try to overdose tonight"" indicates a current plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both: ""again"" indicates past attempts, and ""tonight"" indicates current/future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the use of ""again"" clearly points to previous attempts. The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan/method (""overdose tonight""), which would typically point to 'Behavior'.
   - However, the crucial element is the mention of ""again"", which signifies past attempts.
   - According to the 'Attempt' definition: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
   - Since the post mentions both past attempts (""again"") and current plans (""gonna try to end myself again tonight... Probably by trying to overdose""), the 'Attempt' category is the most fitting.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""my time on this earth is coming to an end"", ""know they're dying"", ""I know I'm at the end"", ""My death will release my pain"". The word ""suicide"" is not explicitly used, but the desire for death as a release is clear.
   - Emotional indicators: ""can't fight anymore, I can't try anymore"", ""so tired"", ""pain"", ""tortured soul"". These indicate severe hopelessness, exhaustion, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""my time on this earth is coming to an end"" and ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all"" are direct expressions of a desire to die and not be alive.

The post goes beyond vague general dissatisfaction and explicitly expresses an impending end to life as a release.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""my time on this earth is coming to an end in the next month or two"" indicates a future intention/belief about their life ending. ""I can't fight anymore"" refers to a current state.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and a belief that their life is ending, which fits the ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" part of the 'Ideation' definition.
   - It does not contain any specific plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - It goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death by explicitly stating a desire for their life to end as a release from pain, thus it is not 'Indicator'.

I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options .

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, only the general act of ""contemplate method"" without detailing *what* method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Based on the definition, 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal thoughts"").
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past attempt is described.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because while the user contemplates methods, no *specific* method or *preparations* are mentioned. The post explicitly states ""contemplate method"" but does not provide details of *a* method or *any* steps taken towards it.

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE.

I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" It also expresses a desire to die: ""I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong feelings of self-hatred (""I hate myself so much""), regret, sorrow, hopelessness (""I dont see any future ahead for me""), and fear.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, ""I was hospitalised for it previously"" is a strong indicator of a past suicide attempt or a severe suicidal crisis that led to hospitalization, which falls under the ""concrete action"" aspect of the 'Attempt' definition.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I've struggled with suicide before.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I dont see any future ahead for me,"" ""I will be joining her as well,"" and ""all the pain I will cause with my passing.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The phrase ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously"" refers to past events.
    *   The phrases ""I dont see any future ahead for me,"" ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well,"" and ""all the pain I will cause with my passing"" refer to current feelings and future intentions/fears.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which would qualify it for 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the crucial part is ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" Hospitalization for suicide strongly implies a concrete action or a severe crisis that required intervention, going beyond mere ideation.
    *   Furthermore, the 'Attempt' definition also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While there isn't a *specific plan* mentioned for the future, there is clear *current ideation* and a strong indication of future intent (""joining her as well"", ""my passing""). The combination of a past history of hospitalization for suicide (implying an attempt or severe crisis) and current strong suicidal ideation aligns best with the 'Attempt' category.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because no specific plan or method for a *current* action is mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' as suicide and suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned.
    *   The presence of past hospitalization for suicide, combined with current ideation, pushes it beyond 'Ideation' into 'Attempt' based on the provided definitions.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I wake up even more tired of living,"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" While not explicitly using the word ""suicide,"" ""tired of living"" directly expresses a desire not to continue existing, and ""have to stop it"" in this context implies ending the suffering, which points towards ending life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My mind is hell,"" ""mental battle that I am losing,"" ""painful,"" ""nothing changes,"" ""worse thoughts each time,"" ""eating my mind,"" ""tear me down every night,"" ""feel so stupid,"" ""feel so weak, so hopeless."" These indicate severe despair, hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans (e.g., tools, locations, methods) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I wake up even more tired of living"" is a direct expression of not wanting to continue living. ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" implies an impending action to end the current state of suffering, which in this context strongly suggests ending life. These phrases fit the 'Ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expressions ""tired of living"" and ""have to stop it"" are direct enough to indicate suicidal thoughts/feelings, moving beyond general distress.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan, so 'behavior' is ruled out.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and a sense of impending action (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not Indicator:** The post contains explicit expressions of not wanting to live (""tired of living"", ""have to stop it""), which goes beyond general distress and indicates suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Not Behavior:** There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.
    *   **Not Attempt:** There is no description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Fits Ideation:** The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (a desire to not be alive any longer) without any specific plan to commit suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I wanna go sleep forever"" is a clear euphemism for wanting to die or end one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""can't take this shit no more I'm sick and tired of my shitty life"" indicates extreme distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have 58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"" explicitly states the possession of a large quantity of specific medications, which constitutes a specific means/method (overdose).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I wanna go sleep forever"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I wanna go sleep forever""), moving it beyond 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I just want to end it"" strongly implies ending one's life. There are no explicit mentions of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"" by name, but ""end it"" in this context is a clear desire to cease existing.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post expresses a desire not to wake up (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow""), indicating a wish to die. It mentions feeling ""Tired of being alone"" and ""depressed,"" which are emotional indicators of distress. Crucially, it states, ""that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again,"" which is a direct reference to past suicidal actions.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Yes, the phrase ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. More explicitly, ""to attempt properly again"" directly references past suicidal behavior.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: There is no specific plan or method mentioned for a *current* or *immediate* suicidal action. The ""attempt properly again"" refers to a potential future recurrence of past behavior, not a current, concrete plan.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" refers to a current desire for a future outcome. ""to attempt properly again"" explicitly refers to *past attempts* at suicide. The sentence structure implies a potential future action (""will probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"") triggered by a future event (Christmas not happening), but the core of this phrase is the reference to *past attempts*.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow""), which would typically point towards 'Ideation'. However, the post also explicitly describes ""past attempts at suicide"" with the phrase ""to attempt properly again."" The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" is more of a desire than a concrete plan, the presence of the past attempt mention is the overriding factor according to the provided rules.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""chop me up"", ""never get found again"". These are direct expressions of wanting to die and have one's body disposed of.
   - Emotional indicators: The desire to be killed and hidden suggests extreme despair and a wish to cease existing.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""looking for someone to kill me"" indicates a specific method (being killed by another person) and a form of preparation (actively seeking someone to carry out the act). ""hide my body"" and ""chop me up"" are further details of this plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires to not be alive (Ideation). It explicitly describes a method (""kill me"" by another person) and details of a plan (""hide my body"", ""chop me up""), and the user is actively ""looking for someone"" to execute this plan.

This ""considering it"" in the context of fighting suicidal thoughts, along with ""fantasizing about my death,"" constitutes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings, even if the *desire* is conflicted.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.

The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" expresses a strong desire for the current suffering to stop, but it does not explicitly state a desire to die or to not be alive in general. It's focused on ""this"" (the current experience). According to the definitions, for 'Ideation', there must be ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". For 'Indicator', ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" In this case, the desire is to not live *this* (the current situation) again, not an explicit desire to end life itself. Therefore, it leans towards 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current feelings and intentions (""I don't want to live this again""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post conveys extreme distress and a feeling of being overwhelmed, but it lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a direct, unambiguous desire to die. The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" refers to the current painful experience, not necessarily a desire for death. Following the rule to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, and given the absence of any direct suicidal ideation or planning, 'indicator' is the most appropriate category.

368,It's too hard. This is too hard I want to tell them everything not in writing but on the phone so they can hear the sincerity of my voice. My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship. I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it. And my mom didn't even tell my brother the whole truth. They can't keep hiding it and brushing it off. It's not helping!,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex."" (explicit mention of dying). ""I decided this is it."" (in context of dying).
   - Emotional indicators: ""It's too hard,"" ""horrible,"" ""tired,"" ""keeps getting worse,"" ""not helping!"" (high distress, hopelessness).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" (Leaving a suicide note is a clear preparation).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""reason to die"" and ""I decided this is it"" (in context of ending life).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., gun, pills, jumping) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" A suicide note is explicitly listed as an example of preparation in the 'Behavior' definition.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current distress and a recent action (""I left a note"") taken in preparation for ending life. It's not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide/desire to die is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Ideation' because there is a concrete preparation mentioned (""I left a note""), which moves it beyond just thoughts/feelings. The definition for Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While not a method, a note is a preparation for a specific act.
   - It fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""reason to die"", ""decided this is it"") and mentions a preparation (""suicide note""). The definition states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"".
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes leaving a note as preparation, not a past completed action of self-harm or an attempt.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore. What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight? I just want to be normal. How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
     - ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since."" (Past and ongoing ideation)
     - ""fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period."" (Past event indicating suicidal thoughts)
     - ""I just. Want. To die."" (Current explicit desire to die)
     - ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" (Explicit question about a method of suicide, with a specific desired outcome regarding the body)
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, loneliness, feeling like a burden.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" indicates a search for a specific method or type of method, which goes beyond mere ideation into considering the practicalities of suicide. This is a form of explicit planning or seeking a plan.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit past attempts are mentioned. The ""screamed that I wanted to die"" is ideation, not an attempt. Being ""fired for being suicidal"" indicates suicidal thoughts, not an attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""fired for being suicidal,"" ""How do I kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wanted to die,"" ""I just. Want. To die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post asks ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" This is a direct inquiry about a method and a specific desired outcome. While it's a question and not a statement of intent for a specific method, it signifies active consideration of *how* to commit suicide, which aligns with ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method."" It's not just a vague thought of dying, but a thought about the *means* to die.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past suicidal ideation (""Middle school was the first time... I wanted to die,"" ""fired for being suicidal"") but also expresses current desire to die (""I just. Want. To die."") and a current inquiry about methods (""How do I kill myself...""). The current intent and method inquiry are key.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and desire to die.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post goes beyond just expressing a desire to die. The question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" indicates an active consideration or search for a method, which falls under planning.
   - 'Behavior' fits best because the post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I just. Want. To die."") and includes a clear inquiry about a specific method (""How do I kill myself without leaving a body...""), which constitutes ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method.""
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as there is no description of a concrete past suicide attempt.

The presence of the question about *how* to kill oneself, with a specific constraint, moves this from 'ideation' to 'behavior' as it implies an active consideration of methods/planning.

A lot of times I feel like I wasn't meant for this world. I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is. Everything here is lame and it just makes me sick and I don't really see a future for myself. In the end, I'm just going to keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me. One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains phrases like ""No point in it all,"" ""push me over the edge,"" ""wasn't meant for this world,"" ""what the point of moving on is,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" These phrases strongly imply a desire to end life or hasten death. The ""eternal void"" and ""free from it all"" are euphemisms for death. ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" suggests a desire for an unnatural end.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""No point in it all,"" ""won't get anywhere in life,"" ""people are starting to lose hope in me,"" ""My view of the world is growing more and more dim,"" ""don't really see a future for myself""), despair (""hate being trapped in limbo,"" ""makes me sick,"" ""keep disappointing those who care"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations are mentioned. ""One last push"" is metaphorical, not a concrete method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""No point in it all,"" ""wasn't meant for this world,"" ""what the point of moving on is,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't present, the expressions of wanting to end life and not continue living are very clear and explicit, going beyond general distress. The desire to ""be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" clearly indicates a desire to die by one's own hand. This fits the 'Ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan or method, so 'behavior' is not applicable.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end life and not continue living (""a desire to not be alive any longer""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not mention a specific plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress and clearly indicates a desire to end life, making it more than an 'Indicator'. The expressions are explicit enough to be classified as suicidal thoughts, even without using the specific word ""suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned (""People who commit suicide"").
    *   Emotional indicators: ""painful emotions,"" ""snap and break down"" are mentioned, but in the context of explaining *why* people commit suicide, not as the poster's current emotional state or desire.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post is a general statement about the psychology of people who commit suicide, not an expression of the poster's own desire to die or suicidal thoughts. The risk must correspond to the person writing the post.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a general understanding of *why* people commit suicide, a descriptive observation rather than a personal intention or past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post mentions ""suicide"" but does not express any suicidal thoughts or feelings *of the person writing the post*. It's a general commentary or observation about people who commit suicide.
    *   **Indicator** definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   While ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned, the crucial part for 'Ideation' is ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This post does not contain such an expression from the poster. It's an empathetic, general statement. Therefore, despite the word ""suicide"" being present, it does not indicate the *poster's* suicidal ideation.
    *   The post does not fit 'Ideation' because there is no expression of the poster's own desire to die.
    *   It does not fit 'Behavior' as there is no plan or self-harm mentioned.
    *   It does not fit 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
    *   Given the rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post,"" and the lack of the poster's own suicidal thoughts, it falls into 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" These are direct expressions of a desire not to be alive and a projection of death. The word ""suicide"" is not used, nor is ""self-harm.""

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There are no mentions of specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) related to ending life. The statement ""Dead"" is a future outlook, not a plan of action.

    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not explicitly used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" is a direct expression of expecting to be dead, implying a desire for life to end given the context of extreme distress.

    *   The post does not describe *how* the person intends to die, only that they are tired of living and foresee themselves as dead.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The expressions ""tired of having to live"" and ""can't function"" refer to current feelings and states.
    *   ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" refers to a future intention or outlook.
    *   There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for posts lacking explicit expressions concerning suicide. This post *does* have explicit expressions of wanting to not be alive (""tired of having to live,"" ""Dead"" in five years). Therefore, it's not 'indicator'.
    *   **Ideation:** This category is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrases ""tired of having to live"" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"" clearly fit the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" part. Crucially, there is no specific plan mentioned. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" No plan or self-harm is mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** This category describes ""past attempts at suicide."" No past attempts are described.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire not to live and a future expectation of death, but without any specific plan or method. This falls squarely into the 'Ideation' category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to die.
   - Not 'Ideation' because it includes a specific plan (method: train tracks, date: 18th birthday), moving beyond just thoughts/desires. The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - Not 'Attempt' because the past event described was a thought/near-attempt that was prevented, not a concrete action. The current content describes a future plan, not a past completed attempt.
   - This fits the 'Behavior' definition perfectly: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ...train lines to get run over by)."" The mention of ""suicide by a train"" and ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" with the question ""if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"" clearly indicates a specific method and a plan.

I had a few rougher weeks lately and heard that someone who I know tried to end his life. Since then I keep thinking about it. It used to be something that wasn´t that ""real"" something I would think about, but it seemed more unattainable. It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try. I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""tried to end his life"" (referring to someone else), ""keep thinking about it"", ""ok to try"" (referring to suicide).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""rougher weeks"", ""don't want to think like this anymore"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for the person writing the post.
    *   References to past attempts: The post mentions ""an attempt of someone else"" and ""someone who I know tried to end his life."" It also says, ""I've had some suicidal thoughts through my life,"" but this refers to past *thoughts*, not past *attempts* by the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The poster mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and states, ""It's like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it's now ok to try."" This is a clear expression of current suicidal ideation.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""it's now ok to try"" in the context of suicide, triggered by someone else's attempt, strongly indicates a current desire or consideration of ending one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the poster.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for the poster.
    *   Since there is no explicit plan, 'ideation' is preferred over 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past ""suicidal thoughts"" (""most of them are behind me"") but then clearly states current thoughts triggered by an external event: ""Since then I keep thinking about it. It's like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it's now ok to try."" This indicates current suicidal ideation.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, not by the poster. The mention of an ""attempt of someone else"" is about another person.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts"", ""it's now ok to try"" in the context of suicide) and a desire to not have these thoughts anymore.
    *   There is no specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide mentioned by the poster.
    *   The post does not describe a past suicide attempt by the poster.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""nearly killing myself one night,"" referring to a past event. It also states, ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking,"" which is a clear mention of a future suicidal action.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post describes feelings of dissociation (""don't feel like I'm in my body,"" ""disconnected from life""), hopelessness (""all I can do is watch days pass by""), and a desire for control (""maybe then I could finally feel like I'm in control of myself"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""step off a building or over a bridge"" explicitly mentions specific methods/locations for suicide in the future.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""nearly killing myself one night"" refers to a past event that strongly suggests a past attempt or a very serious near-attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""nearly killing myself"" and ""step off a building or over a bridge"" are explicit mentions of suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The desire to ""finally feel like I'm in control of myself"" through these actions implies a desire to end the current state of suffering and disconnection, which is a form of wanting to not be alive in the current context.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""step off a building or over a bridge"" are specific methods/locations for a future suicidal act.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned for the future plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""nearly killing myself one night"" refers to a past event. While ""nearly"" can be ambiguous, in this context, it suggests a concrete action or a very close proximity to one, beyond mere thought.
    *   ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" refers to a current intention for a future action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit reference to a past event: ""nearly killing myself one night."" This aligns with the 'Attempt' definition, particularly the part about ""historic actions."" While ""nearly"" can be interpreted, in the context of suicide risk, it often implies an action was initiated or very close to being initiated, rather than just strong ideation.
    *   The post also contains explicit suicidal thoughts with a specific plan/method for the future: ""step off a building or over a bridge."" This clearly fits the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   According to the IMPORTANT RULES for 'Attempt': ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Since both a past attempt (or strong near-attempt) and current explicit plans are present, the 'Attempt' category takes precedence.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i need a way out,"" ""i want to take myself out,"" ""i just need it to stop."" ""Take myself out"" is a clear euphemism for suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i need help,"" ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""don't want to deal with it,"" ""disappoint and burden other people,"" ""scared it'll be painful,"" ""i just need it to stop."" (Hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, fear, desperation).
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No specific plan or method is mentioned. The phrase ""scared it'll be painful"" implies contemplation of methods but no concrete one is stated.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i want to take myself out"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i need a way out,"" ""i want to take myself out,"" ""i just need it to stop.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post expresses a desire to end life but lacks any concrete details about how, where, or with what means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (""i want to take myself out"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is an explicit mention of wanting to ""take myself out,"" which is a clear suicidal thought.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The user expresses fear of pain, suggesting contemplation, but not a defined course of action. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""i want to take myself out"" clearly falls under ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" and ""a desire to not be alive any longer,"" and there is no specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of a desire for death.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Screw this,"" ""Can't be fucked with anything anymore"" indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and apathy.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of wanting to die/not be alive. This fits the 'Ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that ""I want to die"" expresses a desire to not be alive, which is a core component of suicidal ideation. It's more than a vague feeling or general dissatisfaction.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan or method mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention/desire (""The more I live the more I want to die"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die (""I want to die""), which directly aligns with the 'Ideation' definition (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no mention of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - It goes beyond general distress or a vague feeling about death; it's a direct statement of a desire to die, making it more than an 'Indicator'. The 'Ideation' definition specifically includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which ""I want to die"" perfectly matches.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post explicitly states ""I have yet to find a way"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing intentions/thoughts (""I have been thinking... for the past 6+ months"", ""I want to die""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to die"", ""thinking on how to die painlessly""). This eliminates 'indicator'.
   - However, the post explicitly states ""but I have yet to find a way"", meaning there is no specific plan or method mentioned. This eliminates 'behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, eliminating 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

   - References to past attempts: ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop."" This refers to past *thoughts*, not past *actions* or attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""killing myself"" is explicitly stated. The phrase ""before I do it"" clearly refers to suicide in context.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Must end this shit show."", ""I'm very OVER this shit."", ""My life is ruined.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This is a clear sign of preparation, akin to writing a suicide note, which is listed as an example under 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past *thoughts* of suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"", ""must end this shit show""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The post also mentions a specific preparation: ""emails to send to my parents before I do it."" The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)."" The mention of farewell emails fits the ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"" criterion. This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
   - The post does not describe a past completed action or attempt, only past thoughts and current preparations for a future act. This rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

When did Human thought it would be cool living so much?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post discusses the concept of dying (""tend to die around 80"", ""60 fucking years left"") and explicitly questions the desire to live (""how people can want to live?"", ""how they actually find important to stay alive?""). There's no direct mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"".
    *   Emotional indicators: The tone is one of weariness, disillusionment, and a strong lack of desire to continue living for a long period (""it wasn't really good"", ""I have to live 60 years more?"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. While not stating ""I want to die,"" the rhetorical questions ""how people can want to live? Like, how they actually find important to stay alive?"" strongly imply the author's *own* lack of desire to live or find importance in staying alive, especially when combined with their dread of the remaining years. This conveys a desire to not be alive any longer.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings about the prospect of future living (""I have 60 fucking years left"", ""I have to live 60 years more"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** The definition states ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" It also mentions ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the post goes beyond general dissatisfaction. The explicit questioning of ""how people can want to live?"" and ""how they actually find important to stay alive?"" in the context of the author's own life (""it wasn't really good"", dreading 60 more years) functions as an explicit expression of a desire *not* to be alive. This is more than just vague distress.
    *   **Ideation:** The definition states ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This aligns perfectly. The post expresses a clear lack of desire to continue living, a weariness with life, and dread of the future, which constitutes an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive. There is no specific plan.
    *   **Behavior:** No plan or self-harm mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempts mentioned.

    Based on the analysis, the post explicitly conveys a desire not to be alive (through questioning the value of life and dreading more years) without mentioning a specific plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" and ""suicidal"" are used multiple times.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the person writing the post. The post discusses the state and potential actions of *others* who might be suicidal. The crucial rule is ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""Suicide by cop"" is a method, but it's discussed as a potential outcome for *someone else*, not a plan of the poster.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a general observation about how actions can impact individuals who are ""passive suicidal"" in a current/future context. It's a commentary, not a personal statement of intent or past action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post uses the words ""suicide"" and ""suicidal"" frequently. However, the core rule states that ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
   - The poster is discussing a general scenario involving other people who are suicidal, not expressing their own suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts.
   - According to the definitions:
     - ""Ideation"" requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" *from the poster*. This is not present.
     - ""Behavior"" requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan"" *from the poster*. This is not present.
     - ""Attempt"" requires ""The content describes past attempts at suicide"" *by the poster*. This is not present.
     - ""Indicator"" states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" While the word ""suicide"" is present, it does not convey *the poster's* suicidal thoughts or feelings. Therefore, it lacks explicit expression *concerning the poster's suicide risk*. The post is a general commentary or question about a sensitive topic, not a self-disclosure of risk.

Based on the strict interpretation of the rules, particularly the one about the risk corresponding *only* to the person writing the post, this post does not indicate suicidal thoughts or actions *from the poster*.

386,"Doctor says I might have Type 1 Diabetes, and I had a plan in mind ever since. The visit was recent, but the doctor says I might have type 1 diabetes. Going to get a blood test at some point to make sure but, if it turns out I do, it doesn't surprise me. Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden. My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens. Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though. Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump if my condition goes south quick and, with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go. Had a couple ideas for how to do it, but getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible. Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states ""had a plan in mind ever since"", ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" (referring to ending life), and ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it"". These clearly indicate suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life"", ""hate being a burden"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly mentions ""with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go"" and ""getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible."" This identifies a specific method (insulin overdose) and a specific means/tool (insulin pump).
   - References to past attempts: ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up."" This describes past ideation or consideration, but explicitly states no action was taken, so it does not qualify as an 'attempt' based on the definition.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrases ""the way I choose to go"" in the context of using a large dose of insulin, and ""had a plan in mind"" clearly refer to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the context implies a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" using an ""insulin pump"". This is a specific method and means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The person is considering acquiring the pump as the preferred method, indicating a future-oriented plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past ideation (""had a plan in mind ever since"", ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't"") but the core of the risk is current/future intention and a specific plan (""think that might be the way I choose to go"" with the pump). No actual past attempt occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide/ending life is explicitly mentioned and there's a specific plan.
   - Not 'Ideation' because a specific method and means (insulin pump, 100s of units of insulin) are identified, which moves it beyond vague thoughts. The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - It fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""think that might be the way I choose to go"") and mentions a specific plan/method (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" via an ""insulin pump""). Insulin is a lethal medication in overdose, and the pump is the tool.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no concrete past action was taken; the post explicitly states ""didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.""
Based on the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and a specific method/means (insulin pump, insulin overdose), 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: ""☹️"", ""tired of everything!"", ""Worst birthday ever!"", feeling ignored/worthless (""walked past me like I was nothing"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have a chance right now"" indicates a current opportunity or means, but no *specific* method (e.g., ""I have a gun,"" ""I'm on a bridge"") is detailed.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill yourself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday? well I do"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned. ""I have a chance right now"" implies an opportunity but not a concrete, detailed method or tool.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations (like acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned, only a general ""chance"".
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. I am uncertain if ""have a chance right now"" constitutes an *explicit* plan as required for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions: ""I do [want to kill myself] and I have a chance right now.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""want to kill yourself"", ""I do""). It mentions ""I have a chance right now,"" which suggests a current opportunity, but it *does not* specify a concrete plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""I have pills,"" ""I'm on a bridge""). The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" Since no specific method or detailed preparation is given, and the rule states ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm finally considering suicide"", ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""stressed"", ""bawling"", ""incredibly difficult"", ""mental health over this school year has been bad"", ""terrible"", ""fucked up my head"", ""confused"", ""desolate"", ""pathetic"", ""this all means nothing"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm finally considering suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to do this anymore"" (in context of overwhelming life struggles), and ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit"" (expressing nihilistic thoughts linked to death).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions (""I'm finally considering suicide""). There are no past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post explicitly states ""I just attempted to end my life."" It mentions self-harm (""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"") and a specific method (""put down my knife""). Emotional indicators like ""shaking and bawling,"" ""worst feeling,"" and ""too much of a pussy"" are present. The user describes being ""right there about to do"" and ""ready to leave everything,"" indicating a very close call with a specific action.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (""attempted to end my life,"" ""kill myself,"" ""almost committed""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die (""ready to leave everything,"" ""Living life as a shell is bullshit"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: A method (knife) and a physical action (cutting, resulting in bleeding) are described. This is beyond just a plan; it's an action that was initiated.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post clearly refers to a very recent past event: ""I just attempted to end my life."" The description of bleeding wrists/thighs confirms a concrete action happened in the past, even if only moments ago.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post directly describes a past action that was an attempt at suicide (""I just attempted to end my life""). It details the physical consequences (""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"") and the method used (""knife""). This perfectly matches the definition of 'Attempt', which focuses on historic concrete actions.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to"", ""I feel like killing myself"", and ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't."" It also mentions ""I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live"" and ""I guess I'm dying alone too"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling hurt, isolation, lack of purpose.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The user explicitly states a *lack* of ""guts"" to act and that it's ""harder than I want it to be,"" indicating no concrete plan or preparation.
   - References to past attempts: The post explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""attempted suicide"", ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""despite wanting to"", ""I feel like killing myself"", ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post indicates a *lack* of ability/courage to act on the desire, not a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The expressions of wanting to die and feeling like killing oneself are current intentions/feelings. The statement about never attempting suicide refers to past non-action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains clear and explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life.
   - It explicitly states that no past attempts have occurred.
   - Crucially, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. In fact, it highlights the *absence* of the ""guts"" to act on the desire.
   - Based on the definitions: 'Indicator' is too vague as suicide is explicitly mentioned. 'Behavior' is incorrect because there is no plan or self-harm. 'Attempt' is incorrect as it explicitly states no past attempts. 'Ideation' perfectly fits: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""plan to kill myself""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""what the fuck"" (frustration, anger)
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself"". While the details of the plan are not provided in this post, the *existence* of a plan is clearly stated. The ""friend snitched on me and told family my plan"" further confirms the existence of a plan that was serious enough to cause intervention.
    *   References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""plan to kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""plan to kill myself"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is detailed in the post.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""my plan to kill myself"" indicates that a plan exists. The fact that a friend ""snitched"" and family is now ""watching me"" suggests the plan was concrete enough to be perceived as a threat and warrant intervention. The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" The post directly states the existence of ""my plan"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past disclosure of a current/future intention (""my plan to kill myself"") which has led to current intervention (""now they're keeping their heads up and watching me""). This is not a past attempt, but a current thwarted plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a plan is referenced.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings by explicitly stating ""my plan"". The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While the *details* of the plan aren't here, the *existence* of ""my plan"" is stated, which implies specific ideas were formed.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""to kill myself"") and explicitly mentions the existence of ""a plan to commit suicide"" (""my plan to kill myself""). The definition of Behavior includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". The fact that the family is now intervening (""watching me"") reinforces that a plan was perceived as real and actionable.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no description of a past action or attempt, only a past disclosure of a plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""im gonna kill myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I hope my baby ends up safe"" indicates concern for a child, but the core intent is suicidal.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""3 weeks from now"" provides a specific timeline. ""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children"" describes a specific preparatory behavior (withdrawal) leading up to the stated act. While no specific *method* of suicide is mentioned, the timeline and the withdrawal are clear *preparations*.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""im gonna kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., how they will kill themselves) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. A specific timeline (""3 weeks from now"") and a detailed description of a preparatory behavior/withdrawal (""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Im gonna minimally interact..."", ""then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Ideation' because there is more than just a desire to die; there is a specific timeline and described preparatory actions (withdrawal for 3 weeks). This goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings.
   - 'Behavior' fits because it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""im gonna kill myself"") and mentions a clear plan in terms of timeline and preparatory actions (""3 weeks from now"", ""minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks""). While a specific *method* isn't stated, the ""preparations taken"" aspect of the 'Behavior' definition is met by the detailed withdrawal plan and timeline.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes future intent, not a past completed action.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""Would this kill me"" directly asks about lethality, implying a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: Implied distress and a desire to end life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, a very specific combination of substances (Midol 3 bottles, Prozac 30 20mg pills, Tylenol bottle, Water bottle full of alcohol) and quantities are listed. This constitutes a detailed potential method for an overdose.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Not the word ""suicide,"" but ""Would this kill me"" in the context of a lethal combination of substances is a direct expression of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Would this kill me"" clearly indicates a desire for death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, an overdose using a detailed list of specific medications and alcohol with quantities.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The detailed list of items and quantities suggests a concrete consideration or preparation of means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Would this kill me"" refers to a hypothetical future action or current contemplation. It is not past.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""Would this kill me""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The post provides a highly specific method and means (detailed list of substances and quantities for an overdose). This goes beyond mere 'Ideation' (which lacks a specific plan).
   - The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons...)."" This post perfectly matches this definition due to the explicit suicidal thought and the detailed plan involving specific lethal medication/drugs.
   - It is not 'Attempt' as it describes a potential future action, not a past one.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it"", ""suicide"", ""doing it in a way that doesn't looks like suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: The user is clearly contemplating ending their life, showing a desire to avoid causing pain to loved ones while still achieving their goal of dying.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""How I'm planning to end it."" ""Like a car accident or something."" This explicitly mentions a method (""car accident"") and indicates a plan to make it look accidental.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""How I'm planning to end it"", ""recently I've been thinking of doing it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""car accident"") and a stated plan (""How I'm planning to end it"", ""doing it in a way that doesn't looks like suicide""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* a mention of a plan or specific method.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more."" ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this."" ""I just can't continue."" ""I wrote a note today.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""struggling,"" ""hopelessness,"" ""despair,"" ""worthless,"" ""at the end of my rope,"" ""at my wits end.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I wrote a note today."" This is a clear sign of preparation for suicide (a suicide note).
   - References to past attempts: No explicit past attempts are described. The ER visit was for seeking help/crisis, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""I just can't continue,"" and ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more"" strongly convey a desire to end their life or current suffering. This goes beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I wrote a note today."" The 'Behavior' definition explicitly lists ""suicide note"" as a form of preparation. This is a concrete action taken in preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""I wrote a note today,"" ""lately it feels like I just can't continue""). It does not describe a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to not continue living, which aligns with 'Ideation'.
   - However, the crucial element is ""I wrote a note today."" The 'Behavior' definition states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". The writing of a suicide note is a direct and explicit preparation, which fits the 'Behavior' category.
   - It is not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of wanting to end life and a clear preparation.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

Based on the explicit mention of writing a suicide note, the classification is 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The key elements are ""Tried didn't work"" and ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" This explicitly mentions trying to end one's life, indicating suicidal intent. The phrasing ""Tried... didn't work"" and ""again"" strongly suggests past actions.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Yes, ""end my life"" is an explicit mention of suicide. There is a direct expression of having wanted to die, evidenced by the past attempts.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods or plans are mentioned. The focus is on the outcome of past actions.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The entire post is in the past tense (""Tried,"" ""didn't work""), referring to past events and actions. It describes past attempts.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post clearly describes ""past attempts at suicide"" (""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness (""there is no better, this is it""), despair, extreme self-loathing (""self-absorbed whiny piece of shit,"" ""fucking monster,"" ""I suck,"" ""burden"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user explicitly states, ""I have no plans."" While methods are mentioned (""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my fucking throat""), they are presented as desires for death, often by external means or as a general wish, rather than a personal plan being formulated or acted upon by the user. The user also states, ""I don't think I'd succeed anyway,"" which further indicates a lack of concrete planning or intent to act on a plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.

Yes, very explicitly and repeatedly: ""I deserve to die,"" ""I just deserve to be dead,"" ""deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my fucking throat.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, the user explicitly states, ""I have no plans."" The methods mentioned are desires for death, not a personal plan of action. The definition of 'behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide."" Given the explicit denial of plans, and the framing of methods as desires for external action, this does not qualify as a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and desires (""I deserve to die,"" ""I want someone to stomp me out,"" ""I wish someone would kick my door down"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are very explicit expressions of wanting to die and suicidal thoughts, not just general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. The content ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is clearly present. It also states ""but without any specific plan to commit suicide,"" which aligns perfectly with the user's statement ""I have no plans."" The mentions of methods are desires for death, not a concrete plan.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. The definition requires ""a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" The user explicitly states ""I have no plans."" While methods are mentioned, they are not presented as *the user's* plan of action. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" reinforces this.

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. The statement ""But the second they're gone, so am I"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to end their life, contingent on their parents' passing. ""I'm only alive by obligation"" also strongly implies a desire not to be alive.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** It is not unclear. The statement ""so am I"" in context of ""the second they're gone"" is a clear expression of suicidal intent, even if conditional.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are detailed. However, the user explicitly states ""I have a plan"". The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I have a plan"" directly fulfills this criterion, even without the specifics of the plan being laid out. The instruction ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" implies that if there *is* an explicit plan mentioned, it should be 'behavior'. Here, the user is *not* unsure; they state they have a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""bad urges tonight"", ""thinking this might be our last conversation"", ""I have a plan"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts/plans.
   - Not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
   - It contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""thinking of killing myself"").
   - Crucially, it explicitly states ""I have a plan"". This direct mention of a plan, even without specific details of the method or preparation, aligns with the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" The user's statement ""I have a plan"" is a clear, explicit mention of a plan.

404,"The questionnaires that include a question asking if I've had suicidal thoughts actually make me less likely to talk about. Because I know it'll cause a massive issue and result in a lot of stress. There going to ask me too many details, and be too insistent with their questioning. I find therapy tough enough as it is, and if lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff, then that's great. Well it's great till it starts to happen more and more frequently. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicitly mentioned twice. The metaphor ""get out of this grave I dug myself"" indicates a feeling of being trapped and hopeless, which is often associated with suicidal ideation.
   - Emotional indicators: ""less likely to talk about"", ""massive issue"", ""lot of stress"", ""tough enough as it is"", ""not sure if I'm strong enough"". These indicate distress, fear of consequences, and a sense of hopelessness or inability to cope.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not a direct ""I want to die"" statement, the explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" directly indicates the presence of such thoughts. The line ""Well it's great till it starts to happen more and more frequently"" implies these thoughts are ongoing and worsening.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post discusses current feelings about questionnaires and therapy, and the increasing frequency of ""suicidal thoughts."" ""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" refers to a current state of mind. There is no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicitly mentioned, which goes beyond general distress.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits best because the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and a sense of hopelessness, but without any specific plan or past attempt. The increasing frequency of these thoughts also aligns with the definition of ideation.

405,"Anyone agree?. I hate how my ex-friend who bullied me into nearly killing myself/shooting up the school is just gonna live this ✨MagIcAl✨ life and I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away. I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""nearly killing myself"", ""I fucking hate living"", ""rotting away"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""hate"", ""stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"", ""I fucking hate living"", ""what the fuck did I do wrong?"", ""Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?"". These indicate strong negative emotions, despair, and hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans or methods for *current* self-harm are mentioned by the poster. The ""shooting up the school"" is attributed to the ex-friend's bullying influence, not a current plan of the poster.
    *   References to past attempts: ""nearly killing myself"" refers to a past state or event. However, the definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" (e.g., overdose). ""Nearly killing myself"" is ambiguous; it could mean severe ideation or being on the verge, but it doesn't explicitly describe a concrete action taken.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""nearly killing myself"" and ""I fucking hate living"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I fucking hate living"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for *current* suicidal intent.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The rule ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here as there is no current plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""nearly killing myself"" refers to a past event/state.
    *   ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"" and ""I fucking hate living"" refer to current feelings/intentions.
    *   Past attempts are described ambiguously (""nearly killing myself""). It does not describe a concrete action that happened in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit mentions of ""nearly killing myself"" and ""I fucking hate living,"" which go beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""I fucking hate living""). There is ""no specific plan to commit suicide"" currently. The past mention ""nearly killing myself"" is not concrete enough to be classified as a past 'Attempt' based on the definition requiring a ""concrete action.""
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no current plan or method mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. While there's a reference to ""nearly killing myself"" in the past, the definition for 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" (e.g., overdose). ""Nearly killing myself"" is ambiguous and does not explicitly state a concrete action was taken. It could imply severe past ideation or being on the verge, but not a completed action. The rule ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'"" reinforces this. The primary current expression is ""I fucking hate living,"" which is ideation.

Based on the explicit current desire to not be alive (""I fucking hate living"") and the lack of a current plan, the most appropriate category is Ideation. The past reference is not concrete enough to be an 'Attempt'.

Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly states ""Survived OD"", ""you can't kill yourself"", ""I could've died"", ""I wanted to"" (referring to dying/OD). Describes the act of ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor"".

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method (""120+ pills of ibuprofen and hard liquor"") was used in the past.
    *   References to past attempts: Yes, the entire post is a reflection on a past overdose (""Survived OD"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""you can't kill yourself"". The intent to die is clear from ""I wanted to"" in the context of the OD.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wanted to"" (referring to the OD).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""120+ pills of ibuprofen and hard liquor"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act itself is described as having occurred.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a detailed description of a past overdose.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes a concrete action (""swallowed 120+ pills... and drank hard liquor"") that happened in the past (""Survived OD"") with the intent to die (""I wanted to""). This perfectly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of suicide, dying, or self-harm. ""Death Stranding"" is a game title and not related to the user's suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hard to keep going,"" ""Every day feels like the previous one,"" ""badly mangled (psychically),"" ""slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away,"" ""I wonder if a long-term cure even exists."" These indicate severe depression, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed, but not a direct desire to die.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""hard to keep going"" indicates difficulty coping with life, but not an explicit desire to end it.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. In this case, there is no explicit mention.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and the pervasive nature of depression. However, it *does not* contain any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or any plans. It fits the definition of 'Indicator' perfectly: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""

I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I've been cutting my self for a long time"" - clear mention of self-harm.
        *   ""For the past month I've been contemplating suicide."" - explicit suicidal thoughts.
        *   ""I didn't want to live before I met her"" - explicit desire not to live.
        *   ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it."" - explicit statement of intent to end life.
        *   ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" - explicit mention of a conditional joint suicide plan.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""numb,"" ""don't get any joy out of life,"" ""fucking lost.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""we will do it together"" and ""I'm ending it."" While this indicates a strong intention and a conditional agreement for a joint act, it *lacks specific details* about the method (e.g., ""how"" they will do it, what tools, location, etc.) for the poster's own suicide. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** The poster describes past self-harm (""cutting my self"") but not a past *suicide attempt*. The mention of the girl's ""failed attempt to commit suicide"" refers to another person, and the rule explicitly states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""contemplating suicide,"" ""kill her self then we will do it together,"" ""I'm ending it.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I didn't want to live,"" ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the poster's own suicide. While ""we will do it together"" is a conditional agreement, it doesn't specify the *method* or *preparations* (e.g., specific tools, location, substances) as required for the 'Behavior' category definition. The ""ending it"" statement is a strong declaration of intent but lacks method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., suicide note, acquiring means) for the poster.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""I've been cutting my self for a long time"" - past self-harm.
    *   ""For the past month I've been contemplating suicide"" - current/ongoing ideation.
    *   ""I didn't want to live before I met her"" - past desire.
    *   ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it."" - future conditional intention.
    *   ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" - future conditional plan (lacks method).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are clear expressions of wanting to die.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits well. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""contemplating suicide,"" ""didn't want to live,"" ""ending it""). It also includes a conditional agreement for a joint suicide, but crucially, it is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"" *for the poster themselves* in terms of a concrete method or preparations. The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'. If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Here, the desire is expressed, but the specific method is absent.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because, while there are strong suicidal thoughts and a conditional agreement, there is no explicit mention of a *specific method* or *preparations* (e.g., ""I have the pills,"" ""I'm going to the bridge"") for the poster's own suicide. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here. The self-harm mentioned is past, not current behavior in the post.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the poster describes past self-harm, not a past *suicide attempt*. The girl's attempt is not relevant for classifying the poster.

Therefore, the post clearly expresses suicidal ideation without detailing a specific, concrete plan or method for the poster's own suicide.

And everybody keeps telling me to do things I can't do. So I'm fucked.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself?"" and ""So that means I need to die because it's better than living in pain.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""It's worse,"" ""Life isn't worth it without her,"" ""I can't,"" ""I'm alone,"" ""living in pain,"" ""I'm fucked."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase ""I don't know what to do"" reinforces the lack of a specific plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself?""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""So that means I need to die because it's better than living in pain.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post lacks any concrete details about how the person intends to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I need to die""). There is no mention of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""kill yourself,"" ""I need to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.

Dad: When I had a daughter, I didn't know it was going to be as disappointing as you. ""All the family knows about you. They are al disappointed"" -mom. &amp;#x200B;. To be continued.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Yes, extensively. Parents explicitly say ""kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself already,"" ""try to kill yourself again,"" and ""cut your wrists again."" These are directed at the user and refer to the user's past actions or potential future actions.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user's direct line ""Dad, If you are treating me like this, why did you want to have a daughter in the first place"" indicates deep distress, pain, and potentially hopelessness stemming from severe emotional abuse and neglect. The parents' quotes also mention the user's ""depression.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Methods like ""gun"" and ""cut your wrists"" are mentioned, but they are presented as accusations or suggestions from the parents, not as current plans by the user.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, explicitly. The parents state, ""What? Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again? Hahahaha"" and ""Why are you crying? Are you going to cut your wrists again?"". These are direct references to the user's past suicidal actions and self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times, primarily by the parents in reference to the user.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The user's *own words* do not explicitly state a desire to die. However, the *content of the post* (the parents' quotes) explicitly refers to the user's past suicidal thoughts/actions.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""gun,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""cut your wrists.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not by the user in the present. The methods are mentioned in the context of past actions or parental taunts.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post clearly refers to *past attempts* and *past self-harm* by the user (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?""). While some parental statements are framed as future questions (""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?""), their primary function in the post is to highlight the user's history of such actions. The user is recounting the impact of these past events and the ongoing abuse.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post's core content, despite being presented as quotes from parents, directly describes the person writing the post as having engaged in past suicide attempts and self-harm. Phrases like ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" are explicit references to *historic actions* of the user.
    *   The definition of **Attempt** is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" This perfectly matches the explicit mentions of past attempts and self-harm by the user, as recounted through the parents' words in the post.
    *   While the user's *own* direct statement doesn't express current ideation or a plan, the *entire post* is about the user's experience, which includes a history of attempts. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"". The post *describes* the person writing the post as having made past attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself"", ""kill myself"" (implied by ""Kim's"").
   - Emotional indicators: Desperation (""I just need a way""), rejection of help/advice (""I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is *asking* for methods (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""), but does not state they have a specific plan or are preparing.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill yourself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I just need a way to Kim's"" - interpreted as ""kill myself"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user is *inquiring* about methods, not stating a method they intend to use or have acquired.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post asks for a method, which indicates a strong desire to act, but it does not *contain* an explicit plan or mention of preparation. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Asking for a method is not the same as having one.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""What's the least painful way..."").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to end life.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past action is described.
   - The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post expresses a clear desire to die and is actively seeking information on *how* to do so. However, it does not state a specific plan, method, or any preparations taken by the user. The user is *asking* for a method, not *stating* one. According to the definitions, 'Ideation' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" Since no specific plan is stated by the user, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" supports this.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal note"" explicitly mentions suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside"" indicates severe emotional and possibly physical distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again."" Writing a suicidal note is explicitly listed as a preparation in the 'Behavior' definition.
   - References to past attempts: ""again"" implies a past instance of writing a suicidal note, but not necessarily a past suicide attempt. The focus is on the current/future intention.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal note"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The intention to write a suicidal note strongly implies a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not a method of *how* to die, but a clear *preparation*: ""write a suicidal note"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""suicide note"" is given as an example of preparation for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I think I'm going to write"" refers to a current intention to perform a future action. ""Again"" refers to a past action of writing a note, but the core of the statement is about a present intention to act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past note-writing is implied, not a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear preparation.
   - Not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts/feelings; it describes a specific preparation for suicide (""write a suicidal note""), which falls under the 'Behavior' definition.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a future intention (""I'm going to write""), not a past completed action of attempting suicide. The ""again"" refers to writing a note, not a past attempt.
   - It fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (implied by writing a note) and mentions a preparation (""suicide note"") which is a key criterion for this category.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""slaying myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of self-harm/suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The phrase ""I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself"" indicates extreme distress, potentially hopelessness or despair, and a contemplation of violent acts, either outward or inward.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""slaying myself"" implies a method (violent self-harm), but it is not specific (e.g., no mention of a particular tool, location, or detailed action).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""slaying myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""slaying myself"" directly conveys a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""Slaying myself"" indicates a general method type (violent self-harm), but it lacks the specificity required for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""with a knife,"" ""by jumping from a specific place""). It's a general idea of self-destruction rather than a concrete, actionable plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by)."" ""Slaying myself"" does not meet this level of specificity. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I will end up... slaying myself"" refers to a future intention or prediction.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Behavior' because while a general method is implied (""slaying myself""), there is no *specific* plan (e.g., specific tool, location, or detailed preparation) as required by the definition of 'Behavior'. It expresses a desire to end life and a general way, but not a concrete plan.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it refers to a future possibility, not a past action.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category, as it involves explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings and a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" This is a direct reference to ""suicidal ideation.""
   - Emotional indicators: Shame, laziness, feeling stupid, overwhelmed, feeling outclassed, general dissatisfaction with life and passivity.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post focuses on a lack of action in general life, not a plan for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""my suicidal ideation.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post states ""I don't want to die— I want to live,"" which is a statement *against* wanting to die. However, the *acknowledgment* of ""my suicidal ideation"" confirms the presence of suicidal thoughts or feelings, which is the core of the 'Ideation' definition.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""suicidal ideation"" is presented as a current internal state (""my suicidal ideation stems from...""). There are no past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because ""suicidal ideation"" is explicitly mentioned, which goes beyond general distress.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits best because the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation,"" indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts or feelings, even if the author currently states they don't want to die. The definition of Ideation includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""shoot myself in the head"", ""I don't die"", ""suicide hotline"".
   - Emotional indicators: Desire to end life, hesitation, fear of disability, rejection of help.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"" is a very specific method and means.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""shoot myself in the head"" and ""suicide hotline"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wanna... shoot myself in the head"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""shoot myself in the head"" using ""my dad's handgun"". This is a concrete method and means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post expresses the *desire* to get the handgun, which is a step towards preparation, even if the user states they are ""not risking it"" due to hesitation. The key is that a specific method and means are *mentioned*. The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The mention of ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"" constitutes a specific method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I wanna get..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a desire to die is present.
   - Not 'Ideation' because a specific method (""shoot myself in the head"") and means (""dad's handgun"") are clearly articulated. The definition for 'Ideation' explicitly states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
   - It fits 'Behavior' because it contains explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific plan/method (shooting with a handgun). The hesitation expressed (""I'm not risking it"") indicates a current lack of intent to execute the plan *at this very moment*, but the *mention* of the specific plan/method is sufficient for the 'Behavior' category as per its definition (""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""dying,"" or ""self-harm."" Phrases like ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" indicate extreme hopelessness about the quality of life, but not a direct desire to end life or commit suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Fuck this World,"" ""unbearable,"" ""helpless, angry and sad,"" ""hate this world,"" ""hate how this world works,"" ""hate the people in my country."" These show profound despair, frustration, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The post expresses that life is not worth living, but does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" or ""I am suicidal.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions of wanting to *die* or *not be alive*. The expressions are focused on the *quality* of life (""life isn't worth living,"" ""can't see myself having a life worth living"") rather than a direct desire for non-existence. The rules state: ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given this strict interpretation, the phrases, while indicative of severe distress, do not explicitly cross the threshold into direct suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific methods or preparations are mentioned.

    *   The post describes current suffering and a bleak outlook for the future (""If my breathing doesn't go back to normal I can't see myself having a life worth living""). There are no references to past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys immense distress, hopelessness, and a feeling that life is unbearable and not worth living *in its current state*. However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or a direct intent to end one's life*. According to the definitions:
        *   **Indicator:** ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide.

        *   **Ideation:** ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer...""
    *   The phrases ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" fall under ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness"" rather than an ""explicit expression concerning suicide"" or ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" in the direct sense required for Ideation, especially given the ""when in doubt... choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" rule.

   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""I'm going to kill myself soon"", ""don't see the point anymore"").
   - It does not include a specific method or concrete preparations, which are required for 'behavior'. The mention of a timeline (""by February"") is a temporal aspect, not a specific *how* or *what* for the act itself. According to the rules, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"". In this case, there is no explicit *method* or *preparation*.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just want to die"", ""gonna end my life"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Too many problems"", ""im a fucked up person"" (hopelessness, self-loathing).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""gonna end my life this month"" indicates a timeframe but no specific method (e.g., how, with what, where) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end my life"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The phrase ""gonna end my life this month"" indicates intent and a timeframe, but it lacks the concrete 'how' or 'where' required for a specific plan as per the 'Behavior' definition (e.g., tools, locations, substances). The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (""gonna end my life this month""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - It's not 'Attempt' because it describes current/future intent, not a past action.
   - It expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I just want to die"", ""gonna end my life""), which aligns with 'Ideation'.
   - It does not include a specific method or preparation, which are necessary for 'Behavior'. The mention of ""this month"" is a timeframe, not a plan for *how* to commit suicide. Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' definition perfectly: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""pessimistic"", ""suffering"", ""mental illnesses"", ""shitty modern world"", ""world is falling apart and soon will turn into hell"", ""got hate for being realistic and honest"". These indicate distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" is a direct mention.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""suicidal thoughts"" directly indicates a desire not to be alive or thoughts about ending one's life, even if the post doesn't say ""I want to die"" directly.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughts helped me to understood the world"" implies an ongoing or past state of having these thoughts, rather than a current plan or a past attempt. It describes the *presence* of suicidal thoughts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because ""suicidal thoughts"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. The post only mentions the *existence* of suicidal thoughts, not actions or plans.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits best. The post ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (""suicidal thoughts"") but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

I'm done being this sad fucked up person. If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out. It feels like only viable solution",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"", ""If I kill myself"", ""It feels like only viable solution"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""hate it"", ""sad fucked up person"", ""done being this sad"", ""I've tried everything at this point. It just feels like nothings gonna work."" (hopelessness, despair).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out."" This indicates a specific future date for the action and an explicit intention to plan.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"", ""If I kill myself"", ""maybe I wasn't cut out for life"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific *method* (e.g., tool, location), but a specific *timeframe* (""on my birthday"") and a clear *intention to plan* (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out""). This constitutes a plan, even if the details of *how* are not yet specified. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" The statement ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out"" is a clear statement of a future plan with a set date and the intent to prepare.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"", ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    *   It goes beyond 'Ideation' because it not only expresses suicidal thoughts but also includes a specific timeframe (""on my birthday"") and an explicit intention to plan (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out""). This commitment to a date and the stated need for planning falls under the 'Behavior' definition, which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" The setting of a date and the intention to plan are forms of explicit planning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" is a clear indication of suicidal thoughts. ""So what is the point anymore"" also conveys a desire to cease existing.
   - Emotional indicators: ""darkness,"" ""depression,"" ""failure,"" ""worst son, brother, cousin, and uncle,"" ""don't deserve love or happiness,"" ""deserve pain and loneliness,"" ""Burden,"" ""fighting this battle alone,"" ""failed."" These indicate severe distress, self-loathing, hopelessness, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" is not used, ""ending it all"" is a very direct and explicit expression of wanting to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" and ""So what is the point anymore"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear; ""ending it all"" is a common and understood euphemism for suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit planning mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" refers to current thoughts and intentions. The rest of the post describes current feelings and struggles.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I've been thinking of ending it all,"" ""So what is the point anymore"").
   - It does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - It does not describe any past suicide attempts.
   - It goes beyond general distress, explicitly stating a desire to end life.
   - Based on the definitions, this fits the 'Ideation' category perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to do this once and for all. I want to get it over with."" (strong implication of ending life), ""my death will be following very soon too."" ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend."" (refers to a suicide attempt).
   - Emotional indicators: ""I feel kind of sorry for my mom though"" (some empathy, but the overall tone is determined).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend."" (temporal plan/intention). ""It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" (clear preparation for death).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""attempt this weekend"" in this context clearly refers to a suicide attempt. ""Do this once and for all"" and ""get it over with"" are direct expressions of wanting to end life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to do this once and for all. I want to get it over with.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""get a will in place"" is a concrete preparation for death. The phrase ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" indicates a timeline and intent to act. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable to end ones life, suitable locations...)"". A will is a preparation for one's death.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""this weekend"", ""very soon"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of wanting to end life and clear signs of planning/preparation.
   - Not 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond just thoughts/desires and includes concrete preparations (""get a will in place"") and a timeline (""this weekend""). The definition of 'Ideation' states ""without any specific plan"". This post contains elements of a plan.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes future intentions, not a past completed action.
   - This fits 'Behavior' because it contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I want to do this once and for all"") and mentions a plan or preparations (""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"", ""get a will in place""). The preparation of a will is a significant step towards planning for death.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains ""I don't wanna die"" (a stated desire *not* to die), ""waste money to then die right after"", ""I really cannot live if I fail"", ""no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades I used to cut won't go that deep"". The phrase ""blades I used to cut"" indicates past self-harm. The discussion of ""meds"", ""place to jump from"", and ""blades"" refers to methods, but explicitly states they are unavailable or ineffective for a lethal purpose.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't want to"", ""I really cannot live if I fail"" (distress/pressure), but also ""for the first time I'm almost happy, I'm almost enjoying doing stuff"", ""I'm in a decent place right now and I want to keep doing things"", ""I'm feeling better nonetheless"" (positive shift, purpose).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Methods are mentioned (""meds"", ""place to jump from"", ""blades""), but the post explicitly states their *unavailability* or *ineffectiveness* for a current lethal purpose. There are no signs of *current* preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""the blades I used to cut"" indicates past self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt* (e.g., ""I overdosed"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, conditionally: ""I really cannot live if I fail."" Also, ""it's not like I wanna live either"" suggests a lack of strong will to live, even if not a direct desire to die. However, this is contradicted by ""for the first time I don't wanna die"" and current positive feelings. The overall expression of wanting to die is conditional and conflicted.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""meds"", ""place to jump from"", ""blades"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, the post explicitly states the *lack* of access to these methods or their ineffectiveness. There is no current plan or preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to past events (""blades I used to cut"").
    *   Refers to current feelings and activities (""I'm almost happy"", ""I'm in a decent place right now"").
    *   Refers to future intentions/conditions (""final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October"", ""I really cannot live if I fail""). The statement ""I don't even know how I'll do it"" is ambiguous but could refer to coping with the test or, less likely given the context of feeling better, a future method of suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt:** The post mentions past self-harm (""blades I used to cut"") but does not describe a past *suicide attempt*. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not appropriate.
    *   **Behavior:** This requires an explicit plan or current self-harming behavior. The post explicitly states the *lack* of viable methods/plans (""no access to my meds,"" ""no place to jump from,"" ""blades won't go that deep""). Therefore, 'Behavior' is not appropriate.
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for posts lacking *any explicit expression* concerning suicide, or direct mention of suicidal thoughts/feelings. While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrases ""I really cannot live if I fail"" and the discussion of specific methods (even if unavailable) *do* indicate suicidal thoughts or feelings, albeit conditional and conflicted. The post goes beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This category includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The conditional statement ""I really cannot live if I fail"" and ""it's not like I wanna live either"" can be interpreted as expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire not to be alive, even if conditional and currently being resisted. The mention of specific methods, even in the context of their unavailability, suggests a history or current consideration of suicidal means, fitting the ""thoughts or feelings"" aspect of ideation. The post clearly lacks a specific plan. Despite the positive shift, the underlying conditional suicidal thought is present.

Considering the definitions, especially ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator',"" the conditional ""I really cannot live if I fail"" and ""it's not like I wanna live either"" suggest a desire to not be alive under certain circumstances, pushing it beyond 'indicator'. The discussion of specific methods, even if unavailable, reinforces the presence of suicidal *thoughts*.

Final decision leans towards 'Ideation' due to the conditional expression of not wanting to live and the clear mental engagement with suicidal methods, despite the current positive shift and lack of a concrete plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""drained me the fuck out of all my motivation,"" ""taken my will to strive,"" ""don't know what to do anymore with my life,"" ""exhausted and thrown out,"" ""neverending process only helps the things I hate the most."" These indicate severe burnout, hopelessness, despair, and a feeling of being trapped and without purpose.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" expresses a profound sense of lost direction and purpose, but not a direct desire to end life or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and a general outlook on life and the future. No past attempts or specific future plans related to suicide are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed and purposeless. However, it *does not contain any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or a desire to not be alive*.
   - According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" Also, ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - Since there is no explicit suicidal ideation (desire to not be alive), despite the severe emotional distress, the post fits the definition of 'indicator'.

   - Emotional indicators: ""failed"", ""failure"", ""toxic family"", ""depression"", ""fear"", ""regret"", ""worthlessness"", ""dumbass"", ""lazy asshole"", ""hate myself"", ""sad"", ""afraid"", ""not strong enough"". These show severe distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, specific methods are listed: ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"", ""start cutting myself"". The phrase ""Once I get a place"" could imply seeking a suitable location, which is a form of preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""net gain for the world if i die"", ""waiting for the end"", ""ready to slip into unconsciousness and die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"", ""start cutting myself"". These are concrete ways of committing suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of ""gun"" implies a tool. ""Once I get a place"" suggests seeking a location. These elements align with the 'Behavior' definition's examples of specific methods and preparations.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"", ""I'm just waiting for the end"", ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"", ""want to die"").
   - Crucially, it lists specific methods (""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"", ""start cutting myself""). According to the definitions, if specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) are present, it should be classified as 'Behavior'.
   - It does not describe a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is incorrect.
   - It goes beyond just a desire to not be alive without a plan, making 'Ideation' incorrect.
   - It clearly mentions suicide and methods, so 'Indicator' is incorrect.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"", ""wanna kill myself"", ""I want to die"", ""contemplating suicide"", ""offing myself"", ""ideating"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing works anymore nowadays""), despair, self-hatred (""I hate myself"", ""Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure.""), guilt (""I also feel guilty for her death"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
     - ""calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go"" (specific method, calculation)
     - ""tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose"" (specific method, preparation/testing)
     - ""determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (...) so that I can potentially jump in front of their speeding car"" (specific method, planning, though ruled out by the user).
     - ""figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself"" (preparation for execution).
     - Explicitly states: ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are described. The post details past *thoughts* and *planning*, but not concrete actions taken. The user states ""But I don't do it. I don't deserve to.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. (""suicidal thoughts"", ""wanna kill myself"", ""contemplating suicide"", ""ideating"")
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. (""I want to die"", ""wanna kill myself"")

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, multiple: ingesting isopropyl alcohol, using a noose, jumping in front of a car.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes: calculating dosage, testing attachment points, planning for privacy during the act. The user explicitly states ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current intentions and detailed plans (""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself."").
   - It also describes past development of these thoughts and plans (""I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now"", ""I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way"").
   - No past *attempts* are described, only past *planning* and *ideation*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and detailed plans.
   - **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post goes beyond just thoughts and desires; it details specific methods, calculations, and preparations. The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - **Behavior:** This category fits well. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" and ""mentions (...) a plan to commit suicide"". It includes ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"" (e.g., specific substance, testing tools, planning for execution). The detailed descriptions of calculating alcohol dosage, testing noose strength, and figuring out how to avoid being caught clearly indicate explicit planning and preparation.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post explicitly states ""But I don't do it. I don't deserve to."" and ""I must remain and suffer."" This confirms no past attempt has occurred, despite the extensive planning. The category definition requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"".

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly states ""kill myself"". Mentions ""the day i chose is very soon"" and ""whatever comes after this"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tensions are really high and everything is fucked up in my family"", ""not cut out for life"", ""can't even imagine mine being worth living"", ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"". Shows clear hopelessness and a long-standing desire to die.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Mentions ""the day i chose is very soon"" (a timeline). Discusses calling grandparents, telling friends ""I love them"", and hugging a little brother, which could be interpreted as farewells or preparations for emotional closure, but not a *method* or *means* of suicide. No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"" indicates a long-standing desire, but not a past *attempt* that actually occurred.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living"", ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The discussion about contacting loved ones is a form of preparation for emotional closure, but it does not describe a concrete *method* or *means* of suicide (e.g., acquiring a weapon, specific location). The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by)"". None of these are present. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""the day i chose is very soon"", ""I'm not interested in being talked down"", ""I'm not cut out for life""). The phrase ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to a past *desire*, not a past *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"") and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits well. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to end one's life (""kill myself"", ""not cut out for life"", ""the day i chose is very soon""). However, it lacks any specific plan regarding *how* to commit suicide (method, means, location). The discussion about contacting loved ones is about emotional goodbyes, not a concrete method of suicide.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While there is a clear intent and a timeline (""very soon""), there is no mention of a specific method, means, or location for suicide. The preparations discussed are emotional, not practical steps towards committing the act itself as defined for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past suicide attempt is described. ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to a long-standing desire, not a past action.

Based on the explicit suicidal thoughts and desire, but the absence of a concrete plan (method, means, location), 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"", ""I Just want to be out of my misery.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""pain for over 5 years"", ""just cba anymore"", ""misery"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit past attempts, but ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" indicates a history of suicidal thoughts/feelings.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""most suicidal I've been"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I Just want to be out of my misery.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" refers to a current state of heightened suicidal feelings. ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" is a current desire. ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" indicates a current intention to withdraw.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past *feelings* of being suicidal.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""most suicidal I've been"") and there's a clear desire to ""be out of my misery"" (desire to not be alive).
   - It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning"".
   - It's not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action or attempt is described. The phrase ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" refers to a state of mind, not a past action.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.

   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair (""Why is it so hard to die"", ""can't find a suitable way to go"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""I can't find a suitable way to go"", indicating a *lack* of a specific plan or method.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I just want to die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post states the opposite (""can't find a suitable way to go"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Based on the explicit lack of a plan, this leans away from 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and feelings (""I just want to die"", ""I just want to kill myself""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I just want to die"", ""I just want to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - However, it explicitly states the *absence* of a specific plan or method (""I can't find a suitable way to go""). This rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no mention of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""low point"", ""shitty grammar"", ""need help"", ""zero social skills"", ""low self esteem"", ""lonely"", ""worried"". These indicate general distress, low mood, and insecurity.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post is asking for advice on improving life by potentially moving to another country.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user is asking for advice on how to improve their life (""worth moving in another country for better living?"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings (""Im in the low point"") and future considerations/questions (""worth moving in another country for better living?""). There is no mention of past attempts or current/future suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general distress, low self-esteem, and loneliness, and seeks advice for improving life circumstances.
   - There are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts or plans.
   - According to the definitions, ""Indicator"" is for posts lacking explicit suicide expressions but may include general distress or sadness. ""Ideation"" requires explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive. ""Behavior"" requires a plan or self-harm. ""Attempt"" describes past actions.
   - This post clearly falls under ""Indicator"" as it shows distress but no suicidal content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains the phrase ""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP"". This is a death wish, but it is directed *at another person*, not the author of the post.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme anger, hatred, desire for retribution.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the poster's own self-harm or suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the desire for death is directed outwards, towards another individual, not the poster themselves.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This is a current expression of anger and a wish for future harm to another person. It does not refer to past events related to the poster's own suicide or current/future intentions of the poster's own suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses extreme negative emotions and a death wish, but crucially, this wish is directed *at another person*, not the author of the post.
   - The ""IMPORTANT RULES"" state: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".
   - Based on this rule and the definitions:
     - 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" *by the poster*. This is not present.
     - 'Behavior' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan"" *by the poster*. This is not present.
     - 'Attempt' requires ""describes past attempts at suicide"" *by the poster*. This is not present.
     - 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" While the post shows distress (anger), it contains no indication of the *poster's own* suicidal thoughts or feelings. The death wish is external. Therefore, it falls under 'indicator' as there is no suicide risk indicated for the person writing the post.

Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I will kill my bullie,"" ""I will kill her,"" and ""Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?"" Crucially, it also contains the phrase: ""Hello guys, for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others."" This links the homicidal intent to the concept of suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I have a problem,"" ""bullying me,"" ""tried every possible thing,"" ""most jealous person,"" ""finally live my life in peace."" These indicate significant distress, frustration, and a desire for resolution, albeit through violent means.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is *asking for* suggestions on ""how to murder her,"" indicating a desire for a plan, but not stating a specific plan they have already formulated or prepared for.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" in the phrase ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user states ""to finally live my life in peace,"" which suggests a desire to live, but free from the bully. However, the user *does* explicitly connect their intent to ""suicide.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned by the user.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   The user is *soliciting* a plan (""Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?""), but not stating a concrete plan of their own. The rule ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" is relevant here.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions (""I will kill her"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because the post explicitly mentions ""suicide."" The definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" This post does not lack it.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While the post expresses a clear intent to harm another person and asks for a plan, it does not state a specific plan for *committing suicide*. The user is asking for a plan to *murder*, which they then bizarrely categorize as a ""type of suicide."" The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide."" Since the user is *asking for* a plan rather than stating one, and the ""if unsure"" rule pushes towards 'Ideation', 'Behavior' is not the best fit.
    *   **Ideation:** This is the best fit, despite the unusual nature of the post.
        *   The post ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" in the sense that the user explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" and frames their violent intent within that context (""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others""). While it's not a traditional ""desire to not be alive,"" the user is explicitly thinking about and linking their actions to the concept of suicide. This is a ""suicidal thought"" in their own distorted framework.
        *   It is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The user is asking for a plan, not stating one. This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition and the ""if unsure"" rule.

    The explicit mention of ""suicide"" by the user themselves, even if in a distorted context (linking homicide to suicide), means it cannot be 'Indicator'. Since there's no past attempt ('Attempt') and no concrete, stated plan ('Behavior'), 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category, interpreting the user's self-categorization of their intent as a ""suicidal thought.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""on the verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end it all"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""seriously cannot do this anymore"", ""My mental health really bad"", ""stress"", ""disappointment and failure"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I know exactly what to do."" This indicates a plan exists in the user's mind, but no *specific* method (e.g., ""pills"", ""gun"", ""jump"") or preparation (e.g., ""bought a rope"", ""wrote a note"") is explicitly mentioned or described in the post.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""on the verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end it all"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""seriously cannot do this anymore"", ""want to end it all"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" suggests an internal plan, but it does not describe any *external* preparations or a *specific* method. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Since the specific method or preparation is not described, and the rule states ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", it leans towards ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""on the verge of suicide"", ""want to end it all"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to die.
   - It's not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
   - It's between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post explicitly states suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life. While ""I know exactly what to do"" implies a plan, it does not *describe* a specific method or preparation as required by the 'Behavior' definition (""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken""). Given the instruction to choose 'ideation' if unsure about an explicit plan, 'Ideation' is the correct classification.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of these.
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired of being unhappy lost and alone"", ""tired of being depressed and always rejected"", ""unhappy life"", ""struggle"", ""sorry"". These clearly indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair regarding their current life circumstances and identity.

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a strong desire for their current suffering and identity issues to be removed (""take all thoughts away from my mind"", ""take all gayness away all gender disphoria all depresion everything negetive out my life""), but not a desire to end their life. The phrase ""tired of being unhappy"" is a general expression of distress, not a direct wish for death or non-existence.
   - Leaning toward 'indicator' as there's no explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and a strong desire for a future change in their identity and emotional state. It mentions past experiences (""molested at 5 years"", ""always had unhappy life"") but these are background for current distress, not past suicide attempts.
   - Past attempts are not described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post conveys deep emotional pain, depression, and a profound sense of unhappiness and rejection. It expresses a strong wish for their current struggles and negative feelings to disappear.
   - However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive*. The plea is for a miracle to change their circumstances and internal state, not to end their life.
   - According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" The post fits this description perfectly. There is significant distress, but no explicit suicidal ideation or plan.

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly asks ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"". This is a direct mention of ""suicidal"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. ... no change in sight."" indicates significant distress, frustration, and hopelessness related to chronic pain.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" strongly implies the user is experiencing or contemplating suicidal thoughts due to their pain, or is seeking others who are, indicating a personal connection to the concept of being suicidal. It's more than just vague distress; it's distress linked to suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings/thoughts (""Anyone suicidal..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly uses the term ""suicidal,"" which rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no explicit expression concerning suicide).
   - The post expresses a thought or feeling directly related to being suicidal, fitting the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.

My substance abuse is rooted in the need to be loved. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm married and I feel alone in my own head. I wish my partner would care about me the way I do about them. I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need. The damage that caused me has been irreparable. Fuck polyamory and open relationships too. I hate now this is normalized now. Not only do I feel distant from my friends, family and everything else around me but also my lover who's supposed to guide me through this pain and make me feel right. After covid, all the other shite that's happened this year too. I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over. I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death and not feel so guilty.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I don't think I can go on much longer."", ""I'm over life."", ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."", ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"", ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""destroyed me mentally"", ""pain"", ""nothingness of no purpose"", ""alone"", ""abandoned"", ""ruined me"", ""irreparable"", ""hate"", ""distant"", ""guilty"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This implies a final task or condition before ending life, but it is not a specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) nor a concrete physical preparation (e.g., acquiring a weapon, writing a note).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of the *poster's own* past attempts. It mentions someone else's suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life"" and connects this to the poster's own desire for death (""it gives me comfort we may see each other again"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't think I can go on much longer."", ""I'm over life."", ""its finally over."", ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This indicates a pre-condition or a final task before the desired end. However, it does not describe a concrete *method* or *physical preparation* (like acquiring means, a specific location, or a suicide note) as defined under 'Behavior'. The definition for 'Behavior' specifies ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations)"". This phrase doesn't fit those concrete examples.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I don't think I can go on much longer"", ""I'm over life"", ""One last record... and its finally over"", ""looking forward to... death""). It also references a past event (someone else's suicide) but uses it to reinforce current suicidal thoughts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""Ideation"").
    *   While ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" suggests a timeline or a final act, it does not describe a *specific method* or *concrete physical preparation* (like acquiring means or identifying a location) that would elevate it to 'Behavior' according to the provided definitions and examples. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Given the ambiguity of this phrase as a *concrete plan* or *physical preparation*, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""I want to die""
   - Emotional indicators: ""pain,"" ""hurt,"" ""stupid,"" ""belittles me"" (anger, despair, desire for revenge/impact)
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No specific plan or method is mentioned. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it"" explicitly indicates a lack of a specific plan or method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I want to die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die.""
   - This clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post states ""Not sure how much but wherever it is,"" confirming the absence of a specific method or location.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no specific plan or method, this rules out 'Behavior'. The definition for 'Behavior' states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" In this case, the post explicitly states uncertainty about the 'how' and 'where'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""I want to die"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die (""I want to die""). This makes it more than an 'Indicator'.
   - However, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide, explicitly stating ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"". This prevents it from being classified as 'Behavior'.
   - There is no mention of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""access to a gun,"" ""dead by the end of the week,"" and ""want my death to come faster."" The user states ""I've started to try and starve myself,"" which is a direct self-harming action with suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feelings of worthlessness (""lost everything important,"" ""can't do anything right,"" ""truly useless,"" ""nuisance"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user states ""I've started to try and starve myself,"" which is an active implementation of a method. They also mention ""hanging myself"" and ""access to a gun"" as other potential methods, with a preference for the gun due to its perceived quickness and painlessness. A timeframe is given for the starvation method: ""dead by the end of the week.""
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts. The starvation is described as something currently started.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the methods (""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""gun"") and the desired outcome (""dead by the end of the week,"" ""want my death to come faster"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned: starving, hanging, gun.
   - Yes, there are signs of preparation/implementation: ""I've started to try and starve myself"" indicates an active, ongoing behavior/plan. This is not just a thought but an action being taken.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current actions (""I've started to try and starve myself"") and future intentions/outcomes (""dead by the end of the week,"" ""want my death to come faster""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there are explicit mentions of suicide and specific methods.
   - 'Ideation' is incorrect because the post goes beyond mere thoughts; the user states ""I've started to try and starve myself,"" which is an active behavior/plan. The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" This post contains specific methods and an action.
   - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions, and crucially, mentions a plan being actively implemented (""I've started to try and starve myself"") and specific methods (starving, hanging, gun). The timeframe (""dead by the end of the week"") further supports this as an active plan.
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect because the post describes a current, ongoing action (""started to try and starve myself"") and future intentions, not a completed past attempt.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just don't want to go on anymore."" ""My life has already been over for six years now"" (metaphorical). ""I plan my suicide every single day.""

   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past *attempts*. ""My life has already been over for six years now"" describes a past feeling, not a past action.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""using a pistol,"" ""an escape bag,"" ""douse myself in gasoline and light up.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I plan my suicide every single day"" indicates ongoing planning, and the mention of specific means (pistol, gasoline) implies a level of consideration beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""I plan my suicide every single day,"" ""I have realistic and practical plans...""). The ""My life has already been over for six years now"" is a past feeling, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""I plan my suicide every single day""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - Crucially, the post goes beyond just thoughts by mentioning explicit plans and methods: ""using a pistol or an escape bag,"" and ""douse myself in gasoline and light up."" This fits the definition of 'behavior' which requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide.""
   - There is no description of a concrete past suicide attempt, only current planning and ideation. Therefore, it is not 'attempt'.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""I feel like I'm at the point in my life"", ""the future is really grim"". These indicate hopelessness and a passive acceptance of death.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it"". It mentions ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" and ""willing to accept when my time has come"", which is a form of passive self-neglect or a lack of will to live, but not an active, specific plan to commit suicide as defined by the 'Behavior' category (e.g., acquiring means, specific locations).
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come"", ""not worth pushing my life further"". This indicates a desire to not actively prolong life and an acceptance of death, which aligns with a desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post explicitly states ""I don't have any plans to end it"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" is a concerning behavior indicating self-neglect and a lack of will to live, but it does not constitute an ""explicit plan like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable to end ones life, suitable locations)"" as required for the 'Behavior' category. It's a passive act rather than an active preparation for a suicide attempt.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Given the explicit statement ""I don't have any plans to end it"" and the passive nature of ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" in contrast to the active planning required for 'Behavior', I lean towards 'ideation'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""As of right now"", ""I feel like I'm at the point""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""Is it suicidal?"") and there are clear expressions of a desire to not actively prolong life or an acceptance of death (""if I die then I die"", ""not worth pushing my life further"").
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because the post explicitly states ""I don't have any plans to end it"".

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the author. The post is about supporting others.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post is general advice for helping others. It does not describe the author's own past, present, or future suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The crucial rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
   - The author is discussing how to help a friend who is thinking about suicide. The post itself does not contain any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts *from the author*. It is a general discussion about supporting someone else.
   - According to the 'indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" While ""suicide"" is mentioned, it is not an expression of the author's own suicidal thoughts. Therefore, it falls under 'indicator' as there is no personal risk expressed by the author.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
     - ""no reason to live""
     - ""it just seems like the end to me"" (implies end of life)
     - ""I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that."" (explicit mention of suicide and acceptance)
     - ""will only drive me further to killing myself."" (explicit mention of killing self)
     - ""nature is just telling me it's time to die."" (explicit mention of dying)
     - ""I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily"" (self-harming behavior, but not a suicide method)
     - ""I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end."" (loss of a coping mechanism, not a plan to use Ativan for suicide)
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, isolation, feeling like a ""waste of life,"" feeling hurt, lack of closure.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post describes current self-destructive behaviors (drinking, stopping meds) and a loss of a coping mechanism (Ativan), but not a *plan* for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide is their life's purpose"", ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""no reason to live"", ""it's time to die"", ""finally becoming content with that"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post mentions stopping medication and drinking heavily, which are self-destructive, but not a specific *plan* for suicide. The Ativan mention is about its absence leading to despair, not its use as a method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current feelings and intentions (""I feel like I am finally becoming content with that"", ""will only drive me further to killing myself"", ""it's time to die"").
   - No past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains multiple explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""suicide is their life's purpose"", ""killing myself"", ""no reason to live"", ""time to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned for how the person intends to commit suicide. While self-harming behaviors (drinking, stopping meds) are present, the definition of 'Behavior' requires an explicit plan for suicide. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Therefore, it does not fit 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The content clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and feelings without a specific plan, which perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""drowning yourself"", ""guaranteed death"", ""transition to death"", ""go and do that"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied hopelessness (""best option for me""), seeking a peaceful end.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""drowning yourself"" is a specific method. ""bottom of the ocean"" is a specific location. The phrase ""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that"" indicates a conditional plan with a specific method and location.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""drowning yourself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post describes a specific method and location (""bottom of the ocean"") and a conditional intent to carry it out (""If I get kicked out... I think I might go and do that""). This goes beyond vague ideation. The definition for 'Behavior' explicitly mentions ""specific method"" and ""suitable locations"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current thoughts and future intentions (""I think its the best option for me"", ""If I get kicked out... I think I might go and do that""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a specific method (""drowning yourself"") and a location (""bottom of the ocean""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The presence of a specific method and a conditional plan to execute it fits the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations"".

I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""not to kill myself"", ""postpone any suicide attempts"".
    *   Emotional indicators: The user expresses excitement and relief (""all I've ever wanted in life"", ""lol"", ""I need to know what happens"") because a reason *not* to commit suicide has emerged. This implies that suicidal thoughts were present and significant enough to require a ""reason not to"" act on them.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" refers to *future* potential attempts being put off, not a description of a concrete past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"" are explicitly mentioned.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post implies a prior or ongoing desire/consideration to die, as it states a reason *not* to do so. This clearly indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts or feelings.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"" as something that needs to be postponed, clearly indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts or feelings. There is no specific plan or method mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""no will to live anymore"", ""I just want to end it all"", ""tired of living like this every day"". While ""end it all"" isn't the word ""suicide"", in context with ""no will to live anymore"", it clearly expresses a desire to end one's life.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""tired and beaten"", ""can't take it anymore"", ""going nowhere"", ""shitty job, shitty family, shitty neighbors, shitty house, shitty everything"", ""worthless loser"", ""nothing to contribute"". These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and self-worthlessness.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No direct mentions of the poster wanting to die, commit suicide, or self-harm. The ""Dead Body"" mention refers to a false report about a smell, not the poster's state.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm so tired,"" ""My heads messing with me,"" ""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""it's hard to deal,"" ""I cant take this torture from these people,"" ""I want to leave,"" ""I have no money to just walk out,"" ""I dont know what options I have left,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs."" These indicate extreme exhaustion, distress, paranoia, feeling trapped, and hopelessness about their current living situation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The desire to ""leave this place"" or ""walk out"" is explicitly about their apartment/living situation, not about ending their life. The phrase ""I'm so tired"" refers to physical and mental exhaustion from lack of sleep and stress. The feeling of ""hell"" and ""suffer"" refers to their perceived torture by neighbors/landlord.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. In this case, there is no explicit mention or clear implication of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current distress and desire to escape their living situation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses severe distress, exhaustion, paranoia, and a feeling of being trapped and tortured by their circumstances. There is a strong sense of hopelessness regarding their ability to change their situation (""I have no money to just walk out,"" ""I dont know what options I have left"").
   - However, crucially, there is *no explicit mention* of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The distress is focused on their living situation and the perceived actions of others.
   - According to the definitions, 'Indicator' applies when ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This perfectly matches the content of the post.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Possible suicide date is in July."" ""debating it"" (referring to suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: ""My parents don't love me,"" ""I have nobody,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope',"" ""I don't even know who I am anymore."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and identity confusion.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A ""Possible suicide date is in July"" is mentioned. This is a temporal plan, but no specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is described.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Possible suicide date is in July.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the mention of a ""suicide date"" implies a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Only a temporal date is mentioned, not concrete preparations like acquiring means or choosing a specific location/method. The definition of 'behavior' emphasizes ""specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations)"". A date alone does not meet this specific criteria for 'behavior'.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The presence of a date is a form of planning, but it lacks the *method* or *means* specificity required by the 'behavior' definition.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to future intentions (""Possible suicide date is in July"") and current internal debate.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'attempt' because it refers to a future possibility, not a past action.
   - Between 'ideation' and 'behavior': The post explicitly states suicidal thoughts and even a potential date. However, the 'behavior' definition requires a ""specific method or preparations taken"" (e.g., tools, locations, substances). A ""possible suicide date"" is a temporal plan but lacks the *how* or *with what* details that define 'behavior' in this context. Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", and the lack of a specific method/means, 'ideation' is the more appropriate classification. The post expresses a strong desire to end life and a temporal target, but not a concrete method or preparation.

   - It's not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. In fact, the post states the person will ""probably never kill myself"".
   - It's not 'Attempt' because no past attempts are described.
   - It fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""suicidal thoughts"", ""makes me suicidal"") but without any specific plan to commit suicide. The internal conflict (""will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person"") confirms the presence of the thought without a concrete plan.

Fucked it up. I sent my (ex) boyfriend creepy messages because i'm a fucking idiot and of course no one wanted to be friends with me anymore. I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic. No one from my real life, no classmates or family, none of them. just some random woman who lives on an entire different continent. I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve. I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly states ""ending it all on new year's eve"", ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"", ""amazing way to end it"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""awful year"", ""lonely bastard"", ""fucked it up"", ""fucking idiot"", ""no one wanted to be friends with me anymore"", ""one person left"", ""so tired of failing everyone"", ""can't fucking do another year"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, isolation, and self-blame.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Mentions a specific date/time (""on new year's eve"") and a clear preparation: ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" The existence of suicide notes is a strong indicator of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Refers to past *preparations* (making 3 other suicide notes) but not past *attempts* (concrete actions).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""ending it all"", ""suicide notes"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I'm thinking of ending it all"", ""can't fucking do another year"" (implying not wanting to continue living).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" The definition of 'Behavior' explicitly includes ""suicide note"" as a sign of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to past preparations (""made 3 other suicide notes"") and current/future intentions (""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"", ""this is the one"").
    *   No concrete past attempts are described, only past preparations.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and desire to end life.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post goes beyond just thoughts/feelings and includes explicit preparation (""suicide notes"") and a temporal plan (""on new year's eve""). The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While a specific *method* isn't named, the *preparation* is clear.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" and ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide"" (temporal plan: New Year's Eve) and ""exhibits... preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"". The mention of ""suicide notes"" directly aligns with the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. While past notes are mentioned, these are preparations, not concrete past *actions* of attempting suicide. The definition requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)"".

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I tried to cut myself last night"". This is a direct mention of self-harm.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""breakdown"", ""very bad night"", ""wanted to feel something real"". These indicate distress and emotional pain.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cut myself"" indicates a method.
    *   References to past attempts: ""I tried to cut myself last night"" clearly refers to a past action/attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
    *   However, the act of ""trying to cut myself"" is a severe self-harm behavior, often associated with suicidal ideation or intent, even if not explicitly stated as ""suicide"". The 'Attempt' definition focuses on ""past attempts at suicide"" and ""concrete action need to have happened in the past"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the act implies means were available. This step is less relevant for 'Attempt' as the action has already occurred.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""last night"" clearly indicates a past event.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I tried to cut myself last night"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit self-harm described.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because it's not just thoughts; an action was attempted.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because 'Behavior' refers to current plans or current self-harming behavior. The post describes a past event (""last night"").
    *   **Attempt:** This category is defined as ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The phrase ""I tried to cut myself last night"" perfectly fits this definition, as it describes a concrete, self-harming action that occurred in the past. While the post doesn't explicitly state ""I tried to commit suicide,"" the act of ""trying to cut myself"" during a breakdown is a severe self-harming act that falls under the umbrella of past suicidal or self-injurious behavior, which the 'Attempt' category is designed to capture.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""lost feelings for me"", ""became toxic"", ""nothing and no one"", ""no purpose to live"". These indicate despair, hopelessness, and a sense of worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""plan to kill myself"" but does not specify *how* (e.g., method, location, tools, preparations).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""plan to kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post indicates an intent (""plan to kill myself"") but no specific method, tool, or location.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The definition for 'Behavior' explicitly lists examples of specific plans/preparations (e.g., ""suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations""). The post lacks this specificity.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""plan to kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no mention of past actions.
   - The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
   - 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits well, as ""plan to kill myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal thought and desire, but it lacks the *specifics* of how.
   - 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken..."" The post states ""plan to kill myself"" but does not provide details of a *specific method* or *preparations taken* as required by the 'Behavior' definition's examples. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" reinforces this. The phrase ""plan to kill myself"" indicates intent and ideation, but not a concrete, detailed plan as defined for 'Behavior'.

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing yourself soon"", ""being stopped"".
   - Emotional indicators: The tone suggests a firm decision has been made, with a focus on the impact on others rather than personal distress. ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method, location, or preparation is mentioned. The post is about *how* to communicate the impending act, not *how* the act will be carried out.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing yourself soon"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""killing yourself soon"" is a direct expression of intent to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The discussion is about informing others, not about the means or location of the act itself.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""killing yourself soon"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - It's not 'Attempt' because it refers to a future intention, not a past action.
   - It expresses a clear, explicit desire and intent to end life (""killing yourself soon""). However, it does *not* include any specific plan (method, location, or preparation). The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Since no such plan is present, 'Ideation' is the correct category. The post clearly states a desire to not be alive (""killing yourself soon"") but lacks a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'll kill myself tonight"", ""I want to kill myself so bad"", ""hang myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Fuckkkkkkk"", ""I'm so fucking tired of everything"", ""god damn it"". These indicate extreme distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""hang myself at the woods"", ""tonight"" (timeframe), ""play my favorite music ever"" (preparation/ritual).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""kill myself"", ""hang myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to kill myself so bad"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, a specific location (""at the woods"") and a specific timeframe (""tonight"") are mentioned, along with a final act (""play my favorite music ever""). This clearly constitutes a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'll kill myself tonight"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""I'll kill myself"", ""I want to kill myself so bad"").
   - It also includes a specific plan: a method (""hang myself""), a location (""at the woods""), and a timeframe (""tonight"").
   - This fits the definition of 'Behavior' perfectly: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from)"".
   - It is not 'Ideation' because there is a specific plan.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because it describes future intent, not a past action.
   - It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned with a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions and ongoing preparations (""approaching"", ""started to cancel""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond mere thoughts or desires; there's a set date and preparatory actions (""cancelling friendships""), which fall under the 'Behavior' definition of ""explicit planning like... preparations taken"".
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past suicide attempt is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm gonna commit suicide."", ""die of blood loss.""
   - Emotional indicators: The post conveys extreme distress and a desire to end life, possibly linked to a specific personal issue.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""twist my dick off"" is stated as a method, leading to ""die of blood loss."" This is a specific, albeit graphic and unusual, method. ""I'm gonna wait it off"" implies a process.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm gonna commit suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""die of blood loss.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""twist my dick off"" and ""die of blood loss"" are presented as the method and outcome of the suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I'm gonna wait it off"" could imply a waiting period for the method to take effect, but the core is the mention of a specific method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm gonna..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a specific, albeit bizarre, method (""twist my dick off"" leading to ""die of blood loss"").
   - This goes beyond just having suicidal thoughts (Ideation) because a method is described.
   - It is not an 'Attempt' as it describes future intent, not a past action.
   - It is not an 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category, which requires explicit suicidal thoughts and the mention of a plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""I will eventually die in a much painful way."" (This refers to a natural progression of disease, but the overall context contributes to despair). ""Sayonara"" implies a final farewell.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Sayonara,"" ""disease are getting worse,"" ""body are getting weaker,"" ""endured the physical pain and mental depression for years,"" ""lonely,"" ""have no reason to live."" These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and a desire to end suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Have no reason to live"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""Sayonara,"" in this context of deep despair and ""no reason to live,"" strongly implies a final departure by one's own hand. The definition of 'Ideation' includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is clearly present.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""have no reason to live,"" ""Sayonara"").
   - Past events: ""endured the physical pain and mental depression for years.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because it explicitly states ""have no reason to live"" and uses ""Sayonara"" in a context that implies ending one's life. This signifies a desire to not be alive.
   - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
   - It does not describe any past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

Like at this point I am and have done some bad shit so I'm probably doing there anyways so it shouldn't matter, but I keep worrying about it. The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."". Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff. I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The user explicitly states ""Am I the only one who wants to die"". This is a direct expression of a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Idk how to word this without sounding dumb"", ""feeling really isolated recently"", ""can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist"". These indicate distress, isolation, and a lack of support.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The user discusses a *reason* for *not* acting (fear of hell), which is a barrier, not a plan.
   - References to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Am I the only one who wants to die"". This is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that a desire to die is expressed.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan mentioned.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is an explicit expression of wanting to die (""wants to die""), which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly: The post includes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""wants to die"") but without any specific plan to commit suicide.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of past suicide attempts.

For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times."" It also says, ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" and ""he is the only reason im alive right now,"" which imply a desire not to be alive if not for that reason.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There is no indication of a specific method, location, or any steps taken towards an action.
    *   References to past attempts: None. The phrase ""thought of killing myself multiple times"" refers to past *thoughts* (ideation), not past *actions* or attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" and ""he is the only reason im alive right now"" strongly imply a desire to not be alive without that external factor.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post describes suicidal thoughts (""thought of killing myself multiple times"") but provides no details of a plan, method, or preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" refers to past ideation. However, the current state is described as ""it has been getting much worse,"" ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore,"" and ""I need help and I can't get it from anywhere,"" indicating ongoing and worsening distress and current suicidal ideation. There is no description of a past *attempt* (a concrete action).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""killing myself"") and there are clear expressions of a desire not to be alive.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The post describes thoughts, not a plan or self-harming behavior.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past concrete action or attempt is described. ""Thought of killing myself"" is ideation, not an attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""how to die"", ""definitely die"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't care if it's slow or painful or both"" indicates extreme despair and a strong desire for death.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post asks ""Where can I find out how to die"", which implies a search for methods, but no specific method or preparation is stated.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""how to die"" and ""definitely die"" are direct expressions of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to definitely die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The user is asking *where* to find out *how* to die, indicating a lack of a current specific plan, but a strong desire to find one.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Since no specific method is stated, it leans towards ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""I just want to definitely die"", ""Where can I find out how to die"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - Not 'Behavior' because no specific plan or method is stated, only a desire to find out how. The post asks ""Where can I find out how to die"", which is a search for a plan, not a statement of a plan.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past attempts are mentioned.
   - This fits 'Ideation' as it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The desire to find out ""how to die"" is a strong form of ideation.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, indifference, feeling tired of fighting.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method is mentioned. However, the post states ""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"" indicating a timeline for a future act. It also says ""I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least"" which could be interpreted as delaying an act, but also implies a consideration of the future act itself. Crucially, ""I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail"" implies a determination to succeed in a future attempt, suggesting a consideration of effective means.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The phrase ""if I do attempt again"" explicitly states that a past suicide attempt has occurred.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""will to die"", ""If I do it"", and ""attempt again"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""not because I want to be alive"", ""I just don't really want one [a future] either"", ""will to die"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"" indicates a future timeline. ""I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail"" indicates a strong determination for a successful future attempt, implying consideration of effective means, but not explicit preparation details. The ""plans to look forward to"" are explicitly stated as a way to ""buy time"" before a potential future act, not plans for the act itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""if I do attempt again"" clearly refers to a past event. ""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"" refers to a future intention.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions a past suicide attempt (""if I do attempt again"").
    *   It also discusses current suicidal thoughts (""will to die"", ""not because I want to be alive"") and future intentions/timeline for another attempt (""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"", ""I'm not going to fail"").
    *   According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""desire to not be alive any longer"", ""I just want the pain to stop"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""gun to the head"", ""kitchen knife"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days until I'm able to"" indicates a pre-existing plan, even if delayed. The temptation to ""grab a kitchen knife and do it there"" indicates a specific method and location being considered for immediate action.

   - This refers to current preoccupation and future intentions (""soon get the better of me"", ""how and when I'm going to take my life"", ""Going by my plan"", ""can't wait any more"", ""Each day I've been more tempted"").
   - Past attempts are not described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning specific methods (""gun to the head"", ""kitchen knife"") and a specific location (""do it there"" with the knife), as well as referencing ""my plan"". This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" and ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. tools/weapons... suitable locations)"".
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.

It just feels like everyone in my life is focused on their career goals and I can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thoughts of suicide"" is explicitly mentioned. The phrase ""genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live"" implies a struggle against suicidal thoughts or a desire not to live.
   - Emotional indicators: ""genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"", ""can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do"" indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a struggle for self-worth.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. The post is inquiring about inpatient care as a potential step to help.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""thoughts of suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the struggle to ""find the courage to actually live"" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live"" strongly implies a desire *not* to live or a battle against such thoughts. The explicit mention of ""thoughts of suicide"" confirms the presence of suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post is about seeking information on treatment, not preparing for an act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current ""thoughts of suicide"" and future intentions regarding seeking ""inpatient care"" and ""what steps to take"" to ""actually live."" No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" and conveys a struggle to live, fitting the definition of suicidal thoughts or feelings.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The explicit mention of ""thoughts of suicide"" rules out 'Indicator'.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan.

   - Emotional indicators: ""Another day of being mute,"" ""Everyday is the same,"" ""Nothing to say ever,"" ""Can't sleep,"" ""No future."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being stuck.

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""kill myself,"" ""No future.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Bridge.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""on Monday"" indicates a specific timeframe for the planned action, which counts as a form of preparation/planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a future intention: ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The post also includes a specific plan: a method (""Bridge"") and a timeframe (""on Monday""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation' (which is defined as thoughts without a specific plan).
   - The post describes a future plan, not a past action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts *and* a specific plan (method/location and time) perfectly matches the definition of 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""hangman's noose"", ""kms"" (kill myself) mentioned multiple times, ""when I do it"", ""before I go"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""so hard"", ""hardest decisions"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track."" This is a symbolic method reference and a form of mental preparation/commitment. ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms."" This indicates removing an obstacle to committing suicide. ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it."" This is a clear logistical preparation for a future suicide, ensuring a dependent is cared for, which is a concrete step towards facilitating the act.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are described. ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" refers to overcoming a barrier to a *future* act, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kms"" (kill myself) is used multiple times, along with phrases like ""when I do it"" and ""before I go"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the repeated ""kms"" and the context clearly express a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""hangman's noose"" is mentioned as a wallpaper, which is a symbolic reference to a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track"" is a mental/symbolic preparation. More significantly, ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" indicates a concrete logistical preparation (ensuring financial stability for a dependent) that removes a barrier and facilitates the act. This goes beyond mere ideation and into active steps. The phrase ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" also suggests active steps taken to clear the path for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to current thoughts and future intentions (""when I do it"", ""before I go"", ""Not cool to start something and then just kms""). ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" refers to a past action that *enables* a future intention.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described; the ""hurdle"" refers to an obstacle to a future act, not a past act itself.
   - Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts. It also includes elements that go beyond mere ideation:
     - The ""hangman's noose"" wallpaper, while not a physical tool in hand, is a strong symbolic method reference kept ""to stay on track,"" implying a commitment to a method.
     - Crucially, ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" describes a concrete, logistical preparation taken to facilitate the act by removing a significant barrier. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition of ""preparations taken"". The ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" further supports the idea of active steps being taken towards the act. These elements indicate a plan and preparations, even if the exact physical method isn't being acquired at the moment of the post.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent, the symbolic method reference, and the concrete preparatory action (ensuring mom's well-being), the post fits the 'Behavior' category.

   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned (e.g., how, where, with what). This rules out 'behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
   - The definition of 'Ideation' perfectly fits: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The direct statement ""I want to die"" and other expressions of not wanting to continue living, without any concrete plan, align with this category.

481,"Can't take it anymore. I'm a 20 year old with a son, I have no college degree but I did graduate high school.

I've been thinking about just getting it over with.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""he'll be better off without me"" strongly implies the user's absence, likely due to death. ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" is a clear euphemism for ending one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Can't take it anymore,"" ""feel like I failed my son,"" ""worthless as fuck,"" ""I just wish I could be that for my son."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""he'll be better off without me"" and ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" are direct expressions of a desire to end one's life. The latter is a very strong and common euphemism for suicidal thoughts.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': In this case, the expressions are clear enough to indicate suicidal thoughts, not just general distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" refers to current/ongoing thoughts and potential future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""getting it over with,"" ""he'll be better off without me"").
   - It does not include any specific plan, method, or preparations.
   - It does not describe any past attempts.
   - Based on the definitions, this perfectly fits 'Ideation' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan). It goes beyond 'Indicator' because of the clear expressions of wanting to end life, but does not reach 'Behavior' due to the lack of a plan.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

    *   Emotional indicators: ""I'm done"", ""I'm too pissed"", ""don't even want to feel good anymore"", ""embrace the pain"". These indicate extreme distress and a desire to cease feeling, even through death.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'm now gonna start working out until i die or pass out"". This is presented as a specific method to achieve death or unconsciousness. The phrase ""if not, well, you know what happened"" reinforces the lethal intent of this action.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""face death"" and ""until i die"" are direct expressions of wanting to die. The statement ""if not, well, you know what happened"" clearly indicates an expectation of death from the stated action.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""start working out until i die or pass out"" is a specific method the user intends to employ, with the explicit goal of dying. While unconventional, it is presented as a direct action with a lethal outcome.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation beyond the stated intent to begin the activity.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""contemplated suicide for years"", ""I know I am going to do it"", ""plan to be dead long before I retire"".
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses a long-standing, firm intent to die, framed as a practical dilemma regarding future planning.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. No signs of preparation (notes, acquiring means) are present. The timeframe ""maybe in my 20's or 30's"" is vague and distant, not indicative of an immediate plan.
   - References to past attempts: ""contemplated suicide for years"" refers to past thoughts/ideation, not past actions or attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""contemplated suicide"", ""I know I am going to do it"", ""plan to be dead"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I know I am going to do it"", ""plan to be dead"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post states a firm *intent* (""I know I am going to do it"") but explicitly lacks a *specific plan* on how or when (beyond a very broad future timeframe). The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". This is absent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""contemplated suicide for years"" refers to past thoughts. ""I know I am going to do it"" and ""plan to be dead long before I retire"" refer to a future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past contemplation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there is a clear desire to end life.
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The intent is clear, but the *how* is missing, and the *when* is vague and distant. The definition for 'Behavior' requires explicit planning or self-harming behavior.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past suicide attempt is described; only past contemplation and future intent.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post clearly expresses a strong desire to end life without detailing a specific plan.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" directly inquires about the lethality of a substance, strongly implying a consideration of death.
    *   Emotional indicators: The act of saving pills for a future, implied lethal purpose suggests a state of distress and suicidal intent.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""duloxetine"" and ""pills"" are a specific method. ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" indicates possession of the means and a future intent to use them, which constitutes preparation.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly ""I want to die,"" but the combination of asking about lethality and saving pills for ""later"" in this context is a very strong implicit expression of wanting to die by that method. This goes beyond vague distress.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't present, the combination of asking about a specific substance's lethality and stating that they are saving those pills for ""later"" is a clear indication of suicidal *ideation* that includes a *method*.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""duloxetine"" and ""pills"" are mentioned as the specific means.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" is a clear sign of acquiring and holding onto the means for a future, implied lethal purpose. This is a concrete preparation.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no uncertainty here. A specific method (pills/duloxetine) and preparation (saving them) are clearly stated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current possession (""I have"") and future intentions (""saving for later""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post goes beyond general distress by mentioning a specific substance, its lethality, and preparation.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there's clear ideation, the post also includes a specific method (""duloxetine"", ""pills"") and preparation (""saving for later""). The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post implies suicidal thoughts (asking about lethality and saving pills for ""later"") and explicitly mentions a specific method (""duloxetine,"" ""pills"") and preparation (""saving for later""). This aligns with the definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs...).""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I just want to end"" is a direct expression of a desire to end one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I really need to stop feeling this way,"" ""It's hell,"" ""I feel so empire (likely 'empty'),"" ""So out of place,"" ""Not anymore."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of alienation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""haven't yet"" explicitly states that no past attempt has occurred.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end"" is a direct expression of a desire to cease existing/end one's life. This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition: ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post clearly lacks any specific plan or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I just want to end but haven't yet"" refers to a current desire/intention, not a past completed action. The ""haven't yet"" confirms no past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator': The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to ""end"" one's life, which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death. The definition of 'Indicator' states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" or ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" ""I just want to end"" is a direct indication of suicidal thoughts.
   - Fits 'Ideation': The post includes an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""I just want to end""), but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
   - Not 'Behavior': There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.

I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"", ""I cant off myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Fatigue"", ""tired"", ""distracts from life pretty well"" (suggests life is difficult).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""go buy the gas"" is mentioned as a potential method, but immediately negated by ""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas."" This indicates a thought about a method, not an active plan or preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""off myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""buy the gas"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states the *lack* of preparation/action due to fatigue and not leaving the house (""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas""). This is a hypothetical method, not an active plan or preparation. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Here, the plan is explicitly stated as *not* being carried out.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I could be dead"", ""I cant off myself""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I could be dead"", ""off myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   While a method (""buy the gas"") is mentioned, the post immediately clarifies that the individual is *unable* to act on it due to fatigue and not leaving the house. This indicates a thought about a method, but not a concrete, actionable plan or preparation. It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' which requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The post describes the *absence* of preparation.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The mention of ""buy the gas"" is a thought about *how* one *could* do it, but not a plan being acted upon.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""do it"" is strongly implied to refer to suicide, especially with ""I post about suicide constantly"" immediately following. ""Suck it up and do it already"" reinforces this.
   - Emotional indicators: Frustration, self-deprecation (""pussy""), a sense of urgency or resignation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to past discussions or thoughts about suicide, not past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I post about suicide constantly"" directly mentions suicide. The surrounding phrases ""do it"" clearly refer to this.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" express a desire to act on suicidal thoughts.

   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan, method, or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrases ""I should stop... and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" indicate current thoughts and future intentions. ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to past ideation/discussion, but the core of the post is about current intent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to act on it (""do it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
   - The post refers to past *posting/ideation* about suicide, not a past *attempt*. This rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""planned to kill myself in the forest in January"", ""end it"", ""plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"". It also mentions past self-harm: ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself)"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm done and happy"", ""big relief"", ""done with everything"", ""unmotivated to find motivation"", ""I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated... and I'm happy at the same time."" This indicates a complex emotional state, not necessarily despair, but a clear intent to end life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details a specific plan: ""plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"". It also lists preparations: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"".
    *   **References to past attempts:** It mentions a past *plan* to kill oneself in January (""But I didn't""). It also mentions past self-harm (""cut my rights leg""). The January plan was not carried out, so it's not a past *attempt* as per the definition (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times: ""planned to kill myself"", ""end it"", ""plan to hang myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""end it"", ""plan to hang myself"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"", ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to past self-harm and a past *unexecuted plan* (""planned to kill myself in January. But I didn't""). Crucially, it also describes current intentions and preparations: ""now it time to stop the lie and end it. ... So I plan to hang myself... Everything is ready"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and plans.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there are specific plans and preparations, not just thoughts.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. While past self-harm is mentioned, the January plan was *not* an attempt as it wasn't carried out. The definition for 'attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened. The primary focus of the current risk is the *present* detailed plan. The rule ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" does not apply here because the past event described (""planned to kill myself in January. But I didn't"") was a plan, not an attempt. The self-harm is 'behavior'.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits perfectly. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""end it"", ""plan to hang myself"") and clearly mentions a specific plan (""hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"") and preparations (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""). The past self-harm (""cut my rights leg"") also falls under the 'behavior' definition.

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"", ""don't really want to die"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""dumbest shit ever"", ""I wish I was never born"", ""no point for us being here"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, and existential angst.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post discusses dying and wishing not to have been born, but it does not use the word ""suicide"" or phrases like ""kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I wish I was never born"" suggests a desire not to exist, but this is immediately contradicted by ""but at the same time don't really want to die."" The overall sentiment is one of existential questioning and dissatisfaction with life's purpose, rather than a direct desire to end life. The definition for 'indicator' states: ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits this description.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current existential thoughts and feelings. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and existential questioning about the meaning of life and death. However, it explicitly states ""don't really want to die"" and does not contain any explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself,"" nor any plans, methods, or past attempts. According to the definitions, particularly the guidance for 'indicator' (""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'""), this post best fits the 'indicator' category.

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I really need help,"" ""I am very ashamed,"" ""afraid,"" ""messed up big time,"" ""disgusting."" These indicate significant distress, shame, and anxiety about social judgment.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire for help with a social problem and managing shame, not a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to a past action (""bought a used pocket pussy"") and current/future anxieties (""everyone knows about it,"" ""about to start in a new school,"" ""afraid of everyone will think of me""). There is no mention of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress, shame, and fear of social repercussions. It asks for advice on how to deal with a social situation.
   - Crucially, there are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The distress is related to social humiliation and identity, not suicidal thoughts.
   - According to the definitions, ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This aligns perfectly with the post's content.
   - Since there is no explicit desire to die or suicidal thoughts, it cannot be 'Ideation'. Since there is no plan or self-harm, it cannot be 'Behavior'. Since there is no past attempt, it cannot be 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""they dont let you kill yourself"", ""kill yourself"" is explicitly mentioned. ""sick of it"" and ""suffer"" indicate a desire to escape current circumstances.
   - Emotional indicators: ""sick of it"", ""suffer"", ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"" (despair, frustration, anger).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill yourself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the frustration that ""they dont let you kill yourself"" implies a desire to do so, and being ""sick of it"" and wanting to avoid ""suffer"" further supports this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""they dont let you kill yourself""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill yourself"") and expresses a desire to end suffering/life, which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
   - However, there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, which means it does not fit 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""pls fucking end me"" is a direct plea to die. ""till i say im going to do it"" strongly implies ""do it"" refers to suicide/self-harm in the context of seeking attention/care.
   - Emotional indicators: ""lonely"", ""nobody fucking cares"", ""Nobody cares ever"", ""Im such a spoiled piece of shit"" indicate severe distress, hopelessness, isolation, and low self-worth.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""till i say im going to do it"" refers to past *statements* or threats, not past *attempts*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""pls fucking end me"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. ""im going to do it"" in this context strongly implies suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""pls fucking end me"".
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The desire to die is quite explicit with ""pls fucking end me"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no plan or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""pls fucking end me before the day"" refers to a current/future desire. ""till i say im going to do it"" refers to a past pattern of communication, but the core suicidal ideation is present.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""pls fucking end me"") and strong indications of suicidal thoughts (""till i say im going to do it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive without a specific plan, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I hope it'll be me next"" in the context of stabbings, and directly mentions ""with a suicide."" It also states ""it'll be just another stabbing and thats that,"" indicating a desire for death by this specific method.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family"" indicates despair, self-blame, and a desire to avoid perceived negative consequences of a self-inflicted suicide.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user expresses a desire for a specific method of death (""stabbing"") to occur to them, which they see as a way to die (""suicide"") without the associated ""shame."" While not a self-initiated plan, it's a specific *method* they are hoping for to achieve their suicidal intent.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""with a suicide.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hope it'll be me next.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""stabbing."" The user hopes to die by being stabbed. This is a specific *way* they wish to die, which they explicitly link to achieving suicide without shame. The 'Behavior' definition includes ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)."" While the user isn't planning to *self-inflict* the stabbing, they are expressing a desire for this specific *method* of death as their suicide. This specificity moves it beyond vague ideation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations are mentioned.
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""stabbing"") that the user desires to be the cause of their death, serving as their suicide. This specificity about the *method* aligns with the 'Behavior' definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions (""I hope it'll be me next"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a direct desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because, while there are explicit suicidal thoughts, there is also a mention of a *specific method* (""stabbing"") that the user hopes will lead to their death, which aligns with the 'Behavior' definition's clause about ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods).""
    *   **Behavior:** This fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I hope it'll be me next,"" ""with a suicide"") and mentions a specific method (""stabbing"") that the user desires to be the cause of their death, serving as their suicide. The specificity of the desired method, even if not self-inflicted, pushes it beyond mere ideation into the realm of 'Behavior' as it describes a specific *way* the user wishes to die to achieve their suicidal goal.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it refers to future hopes, not past actions.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" multiple times and ""put an end to it all.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Expresses profound despair, social isolation (""0 friends, never had a girlfriend, 0 social life""), lack of skills/job/money, and a strong desire to end life.

This describes a *precondition* or *circumstance* (disappearing, new identity, new country) under which they wish to commit suicide, but it does *not* specify a concrete *method* of suicide (e.g., jumping, overdose, specific weapon) or specific preparations for the *act* itself. The question ""how to run...and simply killmyself?"" indicates a lack of a concrete method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself,"" ""put an end to it all.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post discusses a *scenario* (disappearing to another country) to facilitate suicide, but not the *method* of suicide itself.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations for the *act* of suicide are mentioned (e.g., acquiring means, writing a suicide note). The idea of disappearing is a preparation for the *circumstance* of suicide, not the *method* or *act*. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons...suitable locations)."" None of these are present for the *act* of suicide itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""how to run..."", ""i want to put an end to it all"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    *   It clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, which aligns with 'Ideation'.
    *   While there is a desire for a specific *circumstance* (disappearing) to commit suicide, there is no explicit mention of a *method* or concrete *preparations for the act of suicide itself*. The user is asking ""how to"" do it, implying a lack of a specific plan for the *method*. According to the rules, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" In this case, the plan for *disappearing* is not a plan for the *method* of suicide. Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation'.
