0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""ending my life"", ""go to a bridge and jump off"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Never will find love"", ""mental breakdown"", ""everything in my life is crap even me"", ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and severe emotional distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""go to a bridge and jump off"" specifies a method (jumping) and a location (a bridge).
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""ending my life again"" implies a recurrence of suicidal thoughts or tendencies, but not explicitly a past *attempt* (an action taken).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""ending my life"", ""go to a bridge and jump off"").
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes (""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"", ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""jump off"" is a method, and ""a bridge"" is a specific location.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The statement ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" indicates a strong inclination and a specific plan, even if immediate preparation isn't detailed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" refer to current thoughts and future intentions. ""Again"" refers to past *thoughts/tendencies*, not a past *attempt*.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No, ""ending my life again"" refers to a recurrence of suicidal ideation or tendencies, not a past action or attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** Ruled out because there is not only explicit suicidal expression but also a specific plan/tendency (""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"").
    *   **behavior:** This category fits well. There is explicit suicidal expression (""ending my life""). There is a clear ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" (""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" specifies a method and location). The phrase ""ending my life again"" also suggests a historical experience of suicidal *tendencies*, which aligns with the ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" part of the definition, even if it's not a past *attempt*.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out as there is no mention of a recent suicide attempt, nor a historical *experience of suicide attempt* (an action taken), only a recurrence of suicidal thoughts/tendencies.

    The presence of a specific method and location (""go to a bridge and jump off"") elevates this from mere ideation to a clear tendency/plan to act, placing it in the 'behavior' category.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going to die soon"" is a direct expression of this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I'm going to die soon"" refers to a current belief or future intention.

   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act out.
   - There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

""sometime i think about why i have to live until now"" further emphasizes this existential despair.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hate living"", ""fuck"" - indicate strong negative emotions, despair, frustration, and a sense of meaninglessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I hate living."" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive or a strong aversion to life, which implies a wish for life to end. This constitutes explicit suicidal expression in terms of a desire for non-existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now"" refers to current feelings and ongoing thoughts. It is not about a past, resolved issue.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I hate living,"" questioning existence/desire for non-existence) but lacks any mention of a plan, method, or tendency to act. It also does not mention any past self-harm or suicide attempts. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""I just want to get it over with"" is a strong indirect expression of wanting to end life. ""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last"" explicitly refers to the physical act of ending one's life and its consequences.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""It's not working anymore,"" ""I'm deteriorating,"" ""haven't slept in weeks,"" ""all I see and think are people are going to hurt me,"" ""can't tell anyone,"" ""refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, paranoia, and a feeling of being trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned. No signs of preparation are noted.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I just want to get it over with"" and the contemplation of ""the pain if I go through with it"" are direct expressions of wanting to end life.

    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** This refers to current severe distress and future intentions (""I just want to get it over with,"" ""if I go through with it"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I just want to get it over with,"" ""if I go through with it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on ""plan or tendency to act out."" While no specific plan or method is stated, the user is not merely expressing a wish to die. They are actively contemplating the *act* of suicide, specifically focusing on the physical pain associated with ""going through with it"" and ""how long it's going to last."" This detailed rumination on the *consequences of the act itself*, combined with the strong desire to ""get it over with"" and severe mental deterioration, suggests a significant ""tendency to act out,"" even if fear is a current barrier. It indicates a mental engagement with the process of suicide beyond abstract ideation.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fucked up way to feel"", ""no one sticks around"", ""everyone leaves you eventually"", ""it starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts."" These indicate deep feelings of loneliness, abandonment, self-blame, and persistent emotional pain.

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is present. While not using the words ""die"" or ""suicide,"" this is a strong metaphorical expression of wanting to escape one's own existence or being, which can be interpreted as a desire to not be alive in one's current state. It conveys a profound wish for non-existence or an end to one's suffering by ceasing to be oneself. This is a direct expression of wanting to not be oneself, which aligns with the broader concept of wanting to not be alive.

It reflects current, ongoing emotional distress and a long-standing internal struggle, not a specific past event or a concrete future intention related to suicide.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a strong expression of wanting to escape one's own existence (""I'd leave myself if I could""), which is interpreted as an explicit suicidal expression (desire to not be alive/exist as oneself), even if metaphorical.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.
    *   There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   Based on the presence of an explicit suicidal expression (""I'd leave myself if I could"") without a plan or tendency to commit suicide, the category 'ideation' fits best.

    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i plan to kill myself at 21"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i plan to kill myself at 21"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., ""by jumping"", ""with pills"") is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., ""I've acquired means"", ""I've written a note""). However, the statement ""i plan to kill myself at 21"" constitutes a future-dated plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current distress and a future intention/plan (""i plan to kill myself at 21"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** Ruled out. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post *does* contain a plan (""i plan to kill myself at 21""), which moves it beyond mere ideation. The definition of ideation states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best. The post has explicit suicidal expression (""i plan to kill myself at 21"") and clearly states a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" by mentioning a specific age/timeframe for a future suicide. Even without an immediate method, the existence of a stated plan, albeit future-dated, aligns with the ""plan or tendency"" aspect of the 'behavior' definition.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out, as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die."", ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't like anything about myself."", ""I also hate my job and my family."", ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence."", ""sick and tried of crying myself to sleep every night."" These indicate severe hopelessness, self-loathing, isolation, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The phrase ""Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?"" is a plea for numbness, not a suicide plan. ""I have given myself 5 more years just in case"" indicates a *delay* of potential action, not a plan for it.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I want to die."", ""I am not going to kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to die."", ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence."").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The deactivation of social media and isolation are signs of distress, but not direct preparation for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I want to die"", ""I don't like anything"", ""I hate my job"", ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE""). The future intention to act is explicitly negated for the short term (""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die"", ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence"").
   - However, it explicitly states ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case."" This indicates there is no immediate plan or tendency to commit suicide.
   - This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
   - It is not 'indicator' because the suicidal expression is current and not fully resolved, despite the postponement of action.
   - It is not 'behavior' as there is no plan or tendency to act, nor mention of historical self-harm.
   - It is not 'attempt' as no attempt (recent or historical) is mentioned.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation because the user states they have ""decided on it"" and, crucially, has ""suicidal notes ready"". This indicates a concrete plan and a tendency to act out suicide, as preparation has begun.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses profound distress, self-hatred, and a strong desire for self-transformation or escape from their current identity (""wish I could press a button and be someone else"", ""just want to be someone else"").
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or self-harm. The focus is on body image and self-perception, not on ending life.
   - Based on the definitions, 'ideation' requires ""explicit suicidal expression,"" which is absent here. 'behavior' and 'attempt' also require explicit suicidal expression or actions.
   - The 'indicator' category states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" Since there is no explicit suicidal expression, this post fits the 'indicator' category despite the high level of emotional distress.

I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods or plans are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" This strongly implies past attempts to end their life, especially in conjunction with ""Now it's time to end it.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""NO hope left"" and ""Now it's time to end it"" are direct expressions of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""NO hope left"", ""Now it's time to end it"").
    *   Crucially, it mentions ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" with the repeated phrase ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" which, given the context of ""Now it's time to end it,"" refers to past attempts to end their life.
    *   This directly matches the definition of the 'attempt' category: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, *or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*.""

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned. The phrase ""In the pas I tried to hide this with saying 'I am misanthrope'"" refers to a past coping mechanism for social difficulties, not a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the constant thinking about suicide implies a desire for an end to suffering, which is a direct expression of suicidal ideation.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"").
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.
   - There is no mention of a historical or recent suicide attempt.
   - Based on the definitions, ""ideation"" fits best: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""not scared to die"", ""Good luck to the rest of you"" (implying their own end), ""I have a plan, note and date"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""What's the use"", ""given up in life"", ""torment my family"" (implies feeling like a burden), ""no hell so I'm not scared to die"". Shows hopelessness, despair, and a sense of finality.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" This explicitly states a plan and preparations (note, date).
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the combination of ""not scared to die"" and ""I have a plan, note and date"" is a very strong, explicit expression of suicidal intent.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""not scared to die"" and the existence of a plan and date for their end.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned, but the existence of a ""plan"" is explicitly stated.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""note and date"" are clear signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current feelings (""given up in life"") and clear future intentions (""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""not scared to die"", ""plan, note and date"").
    *   Crucially, it mentions a ""plan"" and ""note and date"", which signifies a clear ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" and preparation.
    *   It does not describe a *recent* or *historical* suicide attempt, but rather a future intention with a plan.
    *   This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'behavior': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide...""

I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""too much recently"", ""anger is worse than ever"", ""rabid dog"", ""constantly on edge"", ""ready to explode"", ""no one would care or miss me"", ""I don't care. If it happens it happens.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post presents a dichotomy: ""either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself."" While a specific *method* for suicide isn't detailed, the *intention* to act on suicide is presented as an immediate alternative to seeking help. The phrase ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet"" indicates active contemplation of taking action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past *suicide attempts*. However, ""given how many cuts I have all over myself"" is a clear reference to past *self-harm behavior*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. (""suicidal thoughts"", ""kill myself"", ""kill myself"", ""end up dead"", ""last post ever. Goodbye."")

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *method* for suicide is detailed (e.g., specific tool, location, substance).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post indicates active contemplation and a decision point (""I'm still debating on this""), but not yet active preparation for a suicide attempt itself. The preparation mentioned is for seeking help.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post clearly refers to current struggles (""suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently"", ""anger is worse than ever"") and future intentions/decisions (""I plan on going to a hospital"", ""So it's either I walk into an ER... or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this"", ""this will probably be my last post ever."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No past *suicide attempts* are described. However, past *self-harm behavior* is explicitly mentioned (""given how many cuts I have all over myself"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** Ruled out because the post contains explicit suicidal expression *and* a clear tendency/contemplation to act on suicide (""I'm still debating on this... or I actually do go through with it and kill myself""). The definition for ideation states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
    *   **behavior:** This category fits well. It requires ""explicit suicidal expression"" (present), ""and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" (present, as the user is debating between seeking help and committing suicide, indicating a strong tendency to act out suicide), ""or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (present, ""given how many cuts I have all over myself""). All conditions for 'behavior' are met.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a recent or historical *suicide attempt*, only self-harm.

The combination of explicit suicidal expression, a current tendency/contemplation of acting on suicide, and a history of self-harm strongly points to 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""can't kill myself"", ""suicidal"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Im so tired"", ""I can't commit to it"", ""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point"", ""they insist that they care but i dont believe it, maybe its my brain playing with me."" (hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, emotional exhaustion, distrust).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"". This identifies a specific method (cliff) and location, and considers its feasibility/logistics.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicidal"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly through ""Im so tired i can't kill myself"" (implies the desire is present but the ability to act is hindered), and ""there's no me at this point.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a good clif"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of ""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"" indicates a concrete thought process about a specific method and its logistics, suggesting a tendency or nascent plan, even if the commitment is stated as lacking.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current state and future consideration (""I know a good clif"", ""I can't commit to it""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal"", ""kill myself"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by identifying a specific method (""a good clif"") and considering its feasibility (""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there""). While the user states ""i just can't commit to it"", the presence of a specific method and consideration of its logistics indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" as described in the 'behavior' category. It's not just a general wish to die, but a concrete thought about *how* it could happen.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

    *   **References to past attempts:** ""all ready tried that before"" (refers to past attempts to communicate distress/seek help, not necessarily a past suicide attempt, but indicates a history of suicidal ideation/distress).

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? ""all ready tried that before"" refers to past attempts to communicate distress, not a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I hold the blade"". This identifies a specific method (blade) and describes an action taken towards using it.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" describes a recent or ongoing action that is an attempt to self-harm/suicide, even if not completed.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blade"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I hold the blade"" indicates physical engagement with the means, suggesting preparation or an active step towards the act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The language (""I can't even fucking kill my self. I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"") indicates a current or very recent struggle and intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The phrase ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" describes an action taken towards suicide, which is a form of self-harm behavior, even if the final act was not completed.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** Ruled out because there is not only explicit suicidal expression but also a specific method (""blade"") and a physical action/tendency (""I hold the blade"") towards committing suicide. This goes beyond mere thoughts.
    *   **behavior:** This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   Explicit suicidal expression: Yes.
        *   Plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide: Yes, ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" clearly describes a *tendency* to act out suicide using a specific *method* (blade), involving a physical action. This fits the definition of 'behavior' as it describes an active engagement with the means of suicide.
    *   **attempt:** While the post describes an action taken towards suicide, the explicit phrase ""can't fucking do it"" indicates that the act was not completed. The definition of 'attempt' typically implies a completed action that was intended to be lethal but failed, or a significant step taken towards that end. ""Holding the blade"" is a *behavior* that is part of or precedes an attempt, but the explicit failure to ""do it"" means it doesn't fully meet the criteria for a *completed* recent suicide attempt. It is a strong *behavior* indicating a high risk.

    Based on the presence of explicit suicidal expression, a specific method (""blade""), and a physical action/tendency (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"") that falls short of a completed attempt, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions (""will happen"", ""will be taking my own life"", ""will not live to see my 40th birthday"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** This category is for explicit suicidal expression *without* a plan or tendency to commit suicide. The post explicitly states ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life,"" which indicates a very strong *tendency* and *resolve* to act, moving beyond mere thoughts.
    *   **behavior:** This category includes explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. While a detailed *plan* (method, exact time) is not present, the declaration ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life"" clearly signifies a strong *tendency* and *intention* to act. The user has made a firm decision about future action, even if the specifics are vague. The statement ""Nothing anyone can do or say can save my life"" further reinforces this strong, seemingly irreversible, tendency.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    The key differentiator between 'ideation' and 'behavior' here is the phrase ""tendency to act out"". The post's certainty (""100% confirmed"") and the declaration of an inevitable future action (""killing myself will happen"") strongly suggest a tendency to act, even without a specific method or immediate timeline.

I shouldn't have talked myself down . Everyday I want to go back and kill myself . The worse decision I ever made was staying here .",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" (mentioned twice).
   - Emotional indicators: ""so so tired"", ""tired of being criticized and unloved"", ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"", ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here."" (Indicates extreme fatigue, hopelessness, regret, and a strong desire for death).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No current specific plan or method.
   - References to past attempts: ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy . I shouldn't have talked myself down ."" This describes a past *missed opportunity* or *interrupted act* that the person regrets not completing. It's not a completed attempt, but a very strong indication of past suicidal intent and near-behavior.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"", ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No current specific methods. The past ""perfect opportunity"" is vague regarding the method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No current signs of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past *missed opportunity* (""6 month ago"") and a strong *current/ongoing desire* (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself""). The regret (""I shouldn't have talked myself down"") reinforces the current desire to have acted.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? It describes a past *opportunity* to commit suicide that was not taken, and the person expresses regret for not taking it. This is a historical experience of being on the verge of suicidal behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
   - The phrase ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"" indicates a strong *tendency to act out* suicide.
   - The mention of ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy . I shouldn't have talked myself down"" describes a ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" in the sense that the intent and opportunity were present, and the person regrets not acting. This goes beyond mere ideation and points to a past near-behavioral event and a current strong desire to engage in such behavior.
   - This fits the 'behavior' category which includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" It does not describe a completed attempt, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Feelings of weakness (""too weak"", ""showing how weak I am"", ""pathetic""), hurt, despair over a relationship situation (""never gonna happen"", ""continue to be used""), embarrassment.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current emotional distress and ongoing relationship issues. There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress, feelings of helplessness, and self-deprecating thoughts (""pathetic"", ""weak""). However, it *lacks any explicit mention* of suicide, wanting to die, or self-harm. There are no plans, methods, or historical references to suicidal or self-harming behaviors. According to the definitions, 'indicator' is for posts with ""no explicit suicidal expression"". This post fits that description despite the high level of emotional pain.

35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working"" is explicitly stated as metaphorical. However, ""I just want to not exist"" is a direct expression of wanting to cease to be alive.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hollow,"" ""sadness,"" ""nothing but sadness,"" ""hurts,"" ""hurts so bad,"" ""hate this,"" ""crying,"" ""suffer,"" ""suffer in silence,"" ""God I fucking hate myself."" These indicate profound despair, hopelessness, self-loathing, and a strong sense of isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not literally as an action. The ""kill myself"" is qualified as metaphorical.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to not exist."" This is a clear expression of a desire for non-existence, which falls under wanting to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings (""Today's my birthday. I feel hollow."") and a desire for a different state of being/non-existence (""I just want to not exist."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression through the phrase ""I just want to not exist,"" which indicates a desire to not be alive.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act on these feelings.
   - There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - Based on the definitions, 'ideation' is defined as ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This perfectly matches the analysis.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""want to end it"", ""take my own life"", ""want to die"", ""hate being alive""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method: ""put a bullet right through it"". This indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide,"" even if the user states they lack the courage. The presence of a specific method moves it beyond 'ideation'.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.
   - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal expression combined with the mention of a specific method aligns with the 'behavior' category.

   - The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The mention of a specific method constitutes a ""plan"".

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>

        *   Friend: ""Friend may kill himself soon"", ""decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Author mentions past ""stress, anxiety, and depression"". Friend is ""struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety"", ""severely depressed"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   Author: Mentions ""my plan"" in the context of a past, failed attempt. No current plan.
        *   Friend: ""decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days)"". This is a plan for the friend, but not the author.
    *   **References to past attempts:**
        *   Author: ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" and ""how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets).""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times, both for the author's past and the friend's current situation.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? For the author, these are historical (""I have been suicidal on-and-off""). The author explicitly states they are currently in a ""good place"" and ""haven't had suicidal ideation in months"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   For the author, no current plan or method is mentioned. A past ""plan"" is referenced in the context of a failed attempt.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   For the author: The post clearly refers to *past* suicidal ideation and a *past* suicide attempt (2009). The author explicitly states their *current* state is one of resolved suicidal issues (""in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months"").
    *   For the friend: The post refers to current/future intentions. (However, the classification is only for the person writing the post).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit mention of the author's ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" (""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded""). This directly matches a criterion for the 'attempt' category.
    *   The post also states that the author is currently ""in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months,"" which is an ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This matches a criterion for the 'indicator' category.
    *   When a post meets criteria for multiple categories, especially when one category ('attempt') specifically includes a severe historical event, and the other ('indicator') covers resolved issues, the more severe historical event typically takes precedence in risk classification, as it signifies a past high-risk behavior. The 'attempt' category's definition explicitly includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt,"" making it the most direct and specific fit for the content regarding the author's past.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific date is set: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it"". ""save some flowers for me please?"" implies preparation for death. No specific *method* (e.g., tool, location) is mentioned.

        *   Current/Future: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"", ""end thing v v soon"", ""currently waiting to see my psychiatrist"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression and a clear plan (specific date). This points towards 'behavior'.
    *   However, the post also explicitly states ""8 yrs of constant attempts"". The 'attempt' category definition includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"". This is a direct match.
    *   Since the post explicitly mentions ""historical experience of suicide attempt"", which is a specific criterion for the 'attempt' category, and 'attempt' is generally considered a more severe classification than 'behavior' when historical attempts are present, 'attempt' is the most appropriate classification. The presence of a current plan further reinforces the severity, but the historical attempts are the definitive element for the 'attempt' category.

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""I want to disappear forever"", ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit."" These are direct expressions of a desire for death, and the statement about dying by 35 implies a self-determined end.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear explicit suicidal expression (""I want to disappear forever"", ""I know I will die by 35"").
    *   **ideation:** This category requires explicit suicidal expression but *no plan or tendency to commit suicide*. While there's no specific *plan*, the statement ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit"" goes beyond mere ideation. It expresses a strong conviction and a stated future outcome, which can be interpreted as a ""tendency to act out... suicide"" within a defined timeframe.
    *   **behavior:** This category requires explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or* mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour. The post contains explicit suicidal expression. The statement ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit"" indicates a strong conviction about a self-determined death within a specific timeframe. This constitutes a ""tendency to act out... suicide"" even without a detailed method. It's a stated future intention with a deadline, implying a resolve that moves it beyond passive ideation.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out. There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the analysis, particularly the strong conviction and stated future intention (""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit""), the post indicates a ""tendency to act out... suicide"" which aligns with the 'behavior' category.

This indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" by actively considering and evaluating means to achieve death, even if framed with frustration or dark humor. It's not just a thought, but an exploration of *how* to act on the suicidal intent.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

   - References to past attempts: Not a past *attempt*, but a past *opportunity* to act on a plan that was not taken, with current regret.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""take them all"" in the context of ""pills"" is a clear euphemism for overdose/suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the regret of not having taken the pills (""why i didnt take them all"") and the self-description as a ""coward"" for not doing so, combined with the despair about their life, strongly imply a desire not to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills"" and the intent to ""take them all"" clearly indicates an overdose.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""every night i count my pills"" is a strong sign of ongoing preparation, engagement with the means, and contemplation of the act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': No, there is explicit suicidal expression and engagement with a method.
   - 'ideation': While there is explicit suicidal expression, there *is* a clear plan (""pills,"" ""take them all"") and a strong tendency/preparation (""every night i count my pills""). This goes beyond mere ideation.
   - 'behavior': This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
     - Explicit suicidal expression: Yes.
     - Plan or tendency to act out: Yes, ""counting pills every night"" demonstrates a clear engagement with a method and a strong ongoing tendency/preparation to act out self-harm/suicide. The regret of not having done it (""why i didnt take them all"") reinforces this tendency.
   - 'attempt': No, the post explicitly states ""why i *didnt* take them all,"" indicating an attempt did not occur.

Based on the presence of explicit suicidal expression, a clear method (pills), and ongoing preparatory actions/tendency (""counting pills every night""), the post best fits the 'behavior' category.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""unbearably strong thoughts,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle,"" ""don't know what to do at this rate."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a profound struggle with daily life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past *suicide* attempts. However, ""don't want to end up in the psych ward again"" suggests a past severe mental health crisis that led to hospitalization, which *could* be related to suicidal ideation or self-harm, but it is not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expressions like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive."" The post describes a struggle to live and a downward spiral of thoughts, but not an explicit desire for death.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No past *suicide* attempts are described. Past hospitalization is mentioned, implying a past severe mental health crisis.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes a severe mental health crisis, a ""major downward spiral"" of thoughts, and an intense struggle to cope (""Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle""). The fear of returning to the ""psych ward"" highlights the severity of past and current distress.
    *   However, the post *lacks explicit suicidal expression*. It does not state ""I am thinking of suicide,"" ""I want to die,"" or similar direct statements. The 'ideation' category requires ""explicit suicidal expression.""
    *   The 'behavior' and 'attempt' categories are not applicable as there is no mention of a plan, tendency to act, self-harm behavior, or suicide attempts (past or present).
    *   The 'indicator' category states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" Since this post has no explicit suicidal expression, despite the high level of distress and implied risk, it best fits the 'indicator' category based on the strict definitions provided. It indicates a significant mental health struggle and potential risk, but not explicit suicidal thoughts.

   - Emotional indicators: ""depression"", ""don't want to ruin my mum's mental state"". Indicates hopelessness and a desire to end suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""my death"", ""off myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I don't want to live anymore"", ""i can't continue to live for decades to come"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions and future outlook (""don't want to live anymore"", ""can't continue to live"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""don't want to live anymore"", ""off myself"") but does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. It also does not refer to any past self-harm or suicide attempts. This aligns directly with the definition of 'ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""killing myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""mentally ill"", ""can't afford treatment"", ""can't hold work"", ""don't have energy"", ""health is shit"", ""what's the fucking point in any of this"", ""fed up of all this bullshit"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""what's the fucking point in any of this"", and the concluding ""what's the point in not [killing myself]"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a future intention/prediction: ""i know that i'm going to end up getting fed up of all this bullshit and just killing myself"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing myself""), which rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan (method, time, place) or any signs of preparation. This rules out 'behavior' based on a ""plan"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, which rules out 'attempt'.
    *   The remaining distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'. 'Behavior' requires ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". While the post expresses a strong conviction about a future suicide (""i know that i'm going to end up... just killing myself""), it does not describe an *immediate* or *active* ""tendency to act out"" (e.g., feeling an urge to do it now, or actively thinking about *how* to do it). It's a fatalistic statement about an inevitable future outcome due to overwhelming circumstances, rather than an active, immediate inclination to commit the act. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation' which states ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

55,"""You look like you're about to die"". Yeah no shit mom, Iam depressed af and tried to kms yesterday, what do you want from me?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""tried to kms yesterday"" (kms = kill myself), which is a direct reference to a suicide attempt. The phrase ""You look like you're about to die"" is a quote from someone else, but the poster's response confirms the underlying suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed af"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for future action.
   - References to past attempts: ""tried to kms yesterday"" explicitly states a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""tried to kms yesterday"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""tried to kms yesterday"" is a direct expression of an action taken to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event: ""tried to kms yesterday"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""tried to kms yesterday"" is a clear description of a recent past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly mentions a recent suicide attempt (""tried to kms yesterday""). According to the definitions, the 'attempt' category is for posts with ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This perfectly matches the content.

56,There has to be a non painful way to do this. I cant. I absolutely cannot fight anymore. This has been non stop for 28 years. Literally non stop pain and suffering. To the point that I question if I did something horrific in a previous life and it was so bad that I'm still paying for it in this life. I cant. Please. I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrases ""non painful way to do this"" and ""I cant live anymore"" are strong indicators of suicidal ideation and a desire to end life. ""Do this"" implicitly refers to ending life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I absolutely cannot fight anymore,"" ""non stop pain and suffering,"" ""I cant."" (repeated), ""Please."" all convey extreme hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method is mentioned, but the phrase ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" indicates a search or desire for a method, implying a tendency to act if a method is found. No signs of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts. ""This has been non stop for 28 years"" refers to chronic suffering, not past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I cant live anymore"" and the implied meaning of ""non painful way to do this"" are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. However, the search for a ""non painful way"" suggests a tendency to seek out a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I cant live anymore"" and ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" refer to current and potential future intentions. The 28 years of pain refer to the past suffering leading to the current state.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression, the phrase ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" suggests more than just passive ideation. It implies an active search or desire for a means to end life, which leans towards a ""tendency to act out.""
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best. There is explicit suicidal expression (""I cant live anymore,"" implied desire to end life). The phrase ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" indicates a ""tendency to act out"" by actively seeking or desiring a method, even if a specific plan isn't articulated. This goes beyond mere ideation by expressing a need to find a *way* to commit suicide.
    *   **attempt:** Incorrect. No mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

The key differentiator between 'ideation' and 'behavior' here is the ""tendency to act out."" The user is not just thinking about dying; they are actively contemplating *how* to achieve it (""non painful way to do this""), which signifies a tendency to move towards action if a method is identified.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide note"".
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses a clear intent to end their life, indicating severe distress and hopelessness. The mention of family being upset but ""supposed to be remembered anyway"" suggests a sense of resignation or finality.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""next week"" (timeframe), ""with drugs"" (method), ""write a suicide note"" (preparation).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide note"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""i want to do it next week. I want to kill myself next week"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""drugs"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""write a suicide note"". A specific timeframe (""next week"") is also provided, indicating a concrete intention.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to clear future intentions (""next week"", ""I want to do it"", ""I just have to write"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a timeframe (""next week""), a method (""drugs""), and a preparatory action (""write a suicide note""). This clearly indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - It does not describe a past or recent suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post does not explicitly use the words ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""self-harm."" However, the phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."" is a strong implicit expression of wanting to end one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""always tired,"" ""so tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""tired of being sick,"" ""pushing everyone away,"" ""lonely,"" ""jealous."" These indicate profound exhaustion, hopelessness, despair, isolation, and a sense of burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance for suicide) is mentioned. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The mention of ""pills"" refers to medication for illness, not a suicide method, although it highlights a sense of treatment failure.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."" is a direct and strong expression of wanting to end their life or current suffering.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post primarily expresses current feelings and a strong future intention (""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** This is incorrect because there is explicit suicidal expression (""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."").
    *   **ideation:** This category requires ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" While there's no specific *plan*, the phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" suggests more than just passive ideation; it conveys a *readiness* and *imminence* to act. This leans towards a ""tendency to commit suicide.""
    *   **behavior:** This category requires ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post contains explicit suicidal expression. The statement ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" strongly indicates a *tendency to act out* suicide. While a detailed plan is absent, the expressed readiness and sense of urgency (""soon,"" ""long overdue"") signify a move beyond mere contemplation to an inclination to act.
    *   **attempt:** This is incorrect as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    Comparing 'ideation' and 'behavior', the key differentiator is ""tendency to commit suicide"" (ideation) vs. ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" (behavior). The phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" signifies a readiness and inclination to *act*, not just to think about it. Therefore, it fits the ""tendency to act out"" criterion for 'behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I have overdosed."" ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" ""it won't kill me, but it'll punish me"". The act of overdosing is a direct self-harm action.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I regret everything"", ""suffering"", ""nuisance"", ""I'm sorry"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have overdosed."" ""I took 500mg Zoloft"". This describes a specific method and a completed action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I finally went through."" ""I have overdosed."" This indicates a very recent, completed action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The post states, ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" While not a direct wish for death, the desire to end suffering is a common underlying factor in suicidal ideation and behavior. Crucially, the post describes a completed self-harm act (overdose).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""I took 500mg Zoloft"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The act of taking the medication implies preparation and execution. The phrase ""I finally went through"" suggests a planned action has been completed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** This refers to a very recent, completed event: ""I finally went through. I have overdosed. I took 500mg Zoloft."" The mention of immediate physical symptoms (""I'm getting a headache and some other bullshit"") confirms the recency.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** Yes, the post describes a recent overdose, which is a form of suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes a completed act of self-harm (""I have overdosed,"" ""I took 500mg Zoloft"").
    *   Even though the user states ""I don't want to die"" and ""it won't kill me,"" the act of overdosing with the intent to ""punish"" oneself and end ""suffering"" is a serious self-destructive behavior.
    *   The category 'attempt' is defined as ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" An overdose is a common method for suicide attempts. The post explicitly states a recent overdose has occurred. This fits the definition of a ""recent suicide attempt"" more precisely than 'behavior', which focuses on plans, tendencies, or historical self-harm behavior (not necessarily attempts). The key here is the *completion* of the act and its nature as an overdose.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrases ""I'm doing it in the near future"", ""knowing I'm going to"", and ""ready to go"" are strong, direct expressions of intent to end one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I feel so at peace right now"", ""I'm ready."" This indicates a resolved decision.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""in the near future"" indicates a temporal plan. ""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend"" can be interpreted as a form of preparation or a farewell, suggesting a concrete decision has been made and actions are being taken in preparation. No specific method is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the intent is unequivocally explicit through phrases like ""I'm doing it"", ""ready to go"", ""knowing I'm going to"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm doing it"", ""ready to go"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""in the near future"" indicates a timeline, and ""spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend"" can be interpreted as a preparatory act or farewell, indicating a firm decision and readiness to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current and future intentions (""I'm doing it in the near future"", ""ready to go"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm doing it"", ""ready to go"").
   - It indicates a clear ""tendency to act out"" (""in the near future"", ""knowing I'm going to"", ""I'm ready"").
   - The mention of spending time with a loved one over the weekend can be interpreted as a preparatory act or farewell, further supporting a concrete plan or tendency to act.
   - It does not describe a past or recent attempt.
   - This goes beyond mere ideation because of the strong sense of resolve, the temporal commitment (""in the near future""), and the implied preparatory actions. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of an attempt, but ""i was suicidal"" refers to a past state.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i was suicidal"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post is a reflection on a past state and a past interaction, not a current expression of suicidal desire.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""it was 4 yrs ago"" clearly indicates this refers to a past event. The post is a reflection on that past experience, not a current intention or state.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only ""i was suicidal"" which refers to past ideation, not necessarily an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly states ""i was suicidal"" but immediately contextualizes it as ""4 yrs ago"". There is no current explicit suicidal expression, plan, or tendency. The post is reflecting on a past, seemingly resolved, issue. This aligns with the 'indicator' category which includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues.""

This points to current/future intentions with active preparation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, it describes preparation, not an attempt that has occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Ruled out due to explicit suicidal expression and preparation.
   - 'ideation': Ruled out because there is not only explicit suicidal expression but also a clear statement of preparation (""I have prepared everything""), which signifies a plan or tendency to act.
   - 'behavior': This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The post explicitly states ""i should die"" and ""kill myself"" (explicit suicidal expression) and ""I have prepared everything"" (plan or tendency to act out).

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the intent is clearly expressed through phrases like ""vanish without a trace"", ""no one will find my body"", and the mention of a ""pistol"" as the final item.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""vanish without a trace"", ""no one will find my body"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""pistol"" is explicitly mentioned as the final item. The location (""secluded spot where no one will find my body"") is also specified.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them"", ""No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes"" are clear signs of preparation and intent to disappear.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to future intentions and a hypothetical future scenario (""When that happens I will have nothing to look forward to. So I would want to vanish..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (implied desire to die, disappear, and not be found, with a specific means).
   - Crucially, it details a clear plan and a strong tendency to act out self-harm/suicide, including specific methods (pistol) and preparatory steps (emptying bank account, leaving belongings, walking to a secluded spot).
   - It does not describe a past or recent suicide attempt.
   - This level of detail in planning and tendency goes beyond mere ideation.

Based on the definitions:
- 'ideation' is ruled out because there is a clear plan and tendency.
- 'attempt' is ruled out because no past or recent attempt is mentioned.
- 'indicator' is ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression and a plan.
- 'behavior' fits perfectly as it describes explicit suicidal expression with a plan and tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I want to die"", ""Im this fucking close"", ""We all just fake it till we die and i give up now"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I want to die"", ""life is shit"", ""i give up now"", ""no one cares""), despair, extreme frustration (""tired of seeing racist homophobic ableist anti semetic prople"", ""fuck the mental health system""), self-alienation (""I don't recognise myself anymore"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The phrase ""Im this fucking close"" indicates a strong proximity to acting on suicidal thoughts but does not specify a method or plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"", ""i give up now"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The phrase ""Im this fucking close"" indicates intense suicidal thoughts and a feeling of being at a breaking point, but it does not describe a concrete ""plan or tendency to act out"" in terms of a specific action or method. It conveys the *intensity* of the ideation rather than a defined behavioral intent.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt or self-harm behavior.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the description of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""cutting an artery"" is a direct and specific method of lethal self-harm or suicide. The mention of ""oxy"" (oxycodone) in conjunction with this method suggests an attempt to manage the pain associated with such an act, indicating a serious consideration of the act itself.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask"" indicates distress, isolation, and a desperate search for information related to a highly sensitive and dangerous topic.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""oxy and cutting an artery"" are specific methods being discussed. The question about pain reduction (""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"") is a practical inquiry related to the execution of this specific method, suggesting a detailed consideration or potential preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""cutting an artery"" is an explicit and direct reference to a lethal self-harm act, which is synonymous with suicidal intent in this context.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Not explicitly stated as ""I want to die,"" but the detailed inquiry about a lethal method strongly implies this underlying desire and a consideration of how to achieve it.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""oxy"" and ""cutting an artery"" are specific means.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The question about using oxy to lessen pain during the act of cutting an artery indicates a practical consideration of *how* to execute the act, moving beyond mere ideation to a detailed contemplation of the process, which can be interpreted as a sign of planning or a tendency to act out.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** This refers to current/future intentions. The question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain..."" is hypothetical but framed as a practical consideration for a potential future act.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression through the mention of a specific lethal method (""cutting an artery"").
    *   The detailed question about using ""oxy"" to lessen pain during this act goes beyond simple ideation. It indicates a practical consideration of *how* to carry out the act, suggesting a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" It's not just a thought, but an inquiry into the practicalities of execution.
    *   It does not describe a past or recent attempt.
    *   Therefore, it fits the 'behavior' category, which includes explicit suicidal expression with a plan or tendency to act out.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" multiple times. However, these are primarily in the context of quoting or discussing the friend's statement (""my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself,"" ""If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide""). The user themselves states, ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness.""
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses hurt, upset, feeling that the friend has ""no faith in me,"" and describes the friend's words as ""brutal,"" ""thoughtless and hurtful."" They are seeking advice on how to handle the situation with the friend and whether their feelings are justified.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the user.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned by the user.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" are mentioned.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user is expressing distress *about* their friend's words and perception, not about their own desire to die. In fact, they state they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a past conversation (""A couple of weeks ago my friend told me..."") and the ongoing emotional impact (""Since then, it's really played on my mind""). The user is asking for advice on how to handle the *friend's* words and the interpersonal relationship, not their own suicidal intentions. The user's own statement ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"" indicates a current effort to manage their mental health.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide, but these are attributed to the friend's statements or are part of the user's reflection on those statements.
   - Crucially, the person writing the post does *not* express their own suicidal ideation or intent. Instead, they are expressing hurt and seeking advice on how to navigate a difficult interpersonal situation caused by their friend's insensitive remarks.
   - The user's statement ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"" indicates an active effort to manage their mental health, which aligns with ""resolved suicidal issues"" or a lack of current suicidal intent.
   - There is no mention of a plan, method, or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide by the user.
   - There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts by the user.
   - Therefore, the post fits the 'indicator' category as it has no explicit suicidal expression from the user themselves, and the user's statement about fighting their mental illness suggests a resolved or actively managed state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""jump out"").
   - It details a specific plan (""at my window right now with scissors"", ""cut the screen and jump out"").
   - It indicates an immediate tendency or proximity to acting out (""i feel like im about to"", ""im at my window right now"").
   - This goes beyond mere ideation because a concrete plan and immediate means are present. It is not an 'attempt' as the action is described as imminent, not completed or historical. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category.

This aligns with the ""behavior"" category which describes explicit suicidal expression with a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. It is not merely ideation because a specific method and intent to act are present. It is not an attempt as it describes a future action, not a past or recent one.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" is mentioned as a desired action/method, implying a location and a way to die, though not a detailed plan or preparation. No specific tools or timeline.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""im going to kill myself one day"", ""might as well die"", ""fucking die"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""im going to kill myself one day"", ""might as well die"", ""just want to disappear"", ""just want to run away to a forest and fucking die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" describes a desired action and location for suicide. This is more than just a thought; it's a specific envisioned behavior.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post expresses current feelings and desires (""im going to kill myself one day"", ""might as well die"", ""just want to run away...and fucking die""). It also mentions a deterrent (""the only thing thats stopping is that there is still a chance to get in to a college""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - The phrase ""just want to run away to a forest and fucking die"" describes a specific desired action and method to achieve suicide. While not a fully detailed plan, it goes beyond mere ideation by describing a ""tendency to act out"" or a specific envisioned behavior/method. The category 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". This specific desired action fits the ""tendency to act out"" criterion.
   - There is no mention of recent or historical suicide attempts, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the presence of a specific desired action/method (""run away to a forest and fucking die"") pushes it beyond 'ideation' into 'behavior'.

74,"Hoping to be murdered. I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die. I'm so hyperaware of how I'm clearly defective and unfit to be alive. It's like I have a terminal illness no one recognizes. I just have to pray for some random person to murder me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""Hoping to be murdered,"" ""hate being alive,"" ""don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""terminally suicidal people,"" ""wish so badly for me to get murdered,"" ""how much I want to die,"" ""unfit to be alive,"" ""pray for some random person to murder me,"" ""end it all,"" and ""stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong expressions of hopelessness and despair are present: ""losing more hope,"" ""life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends,"" ""increasingly difficult to endure,"" ""tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep,"" ""useless I am and how alone I am,"" ""clearly defective and unfit to be alive,"" ""terminal illness.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself."" However, it describes a repeated action: ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works."" This indicates a passive method of seeking death by exposing oneself to lethal risk. There are no signs of preparation for active self-harm.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past suicide attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""terminally suicidal people.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Hoping to be murdered,"" ""I hate being alive,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me,"" ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered,"" ""how much I want to die,"" ""unfit to be alive,"" ""pray for some random person to murder me,"" ""to just end it all.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The desired method is murder by another person or assisted suicide. The *action* taken is repeatedly walking through ""sketchy areas every night"" with the explicit hope of being murdered. This is a passive, indirect method of seeking death.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation for active self-harm. The ""walking through sketchy areas"" is an ongoing, intentional exposure to risk, not preparation for a specific self-inflicted act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current, ongoing suffering and future intentions/desires (""every single day is the same thing,"" ""every night,"" ""every day I'm forced to realize""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression and a strong desire for death, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   The user explicitly states they lack the bravery to ""kill myself,"" which might initially suggest 'ideation'. However, the definition of 'ideation' states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
    *   The post describes a repeated, intentional action: ""I walk through sketchy areas every night"" with the explicit hope of being murdered. This is a ""tendency to act out"" the desire for death, even if it's a passive form of self-harm or suicidal behavior (seeking death by proxy). The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" While not a direct self-harm plan, actively putting oneself in a dangerous situation with the intent of dying constitutes a ""tendency to act out"" the suicidal desire. It goes beyond mere thoughts or wishes by involving a consistent, intentional action.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.

Based on the presence of explicit suicidal expression and a clear, repeated tendency to act out the desire for death by exposing oneself to lethal risk, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I'll experience it painfully"", ""I think I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side."" These are direct expressions of ending life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""glad"" (in a morbid sense), ""painfully"" (desire for a specific experience), ""unwanted"", ""can't take no more"", ""What a joke."" (despair, hopelessness, feeling overwhelmed).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., ""I have a gun"", ""I'm going to jump"") or preparation (e.g., ""I wrote a note"") is mentioned. The phrase ""I'll experience it painfully"" indicates a *desire* for the *manner* of death, but not a concrete method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, there are very direct and explicit expressions of wanting to die and ending one's life: ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I think I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, unequivocally.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** This refers to current and future intentions: ""I'm going to die"", ""I'll experience it painfully"", ""I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side."" The ""day count"" refers to past life experience leading to a current decision.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out. There is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" While there's no *specific plan*, the language used (""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I think I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side"") goes beyond mere thoughts or wishes. It expresses a strong, resolute *intention* and *decision* to act.
    *   **behavior:** ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post contains explicit suicidal expression. While a specific *plan* (method, time, location) is not detailed, the strong, declarative statements (""I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side"") indicate a clear *tendency to act out*. This is a declared intention to end life, not just a contemplation or wish. The phrase ""I'll experience it painfully"" also suggests a conceptualization of the act itself.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out. No mention of a recent or historical attempt.

    The key distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' here is the ""tendency to act out."" The post's language (""I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side"") conveys a firm decision and immediate intent, which aligns with a ""tendency to act out"" rather than just having thoughts or wishes.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions. However, ""disappear"" and ""free from all this pain"" strongly imply a desire to cease to exist or die to escape suffering.
   - Emotional indicators: ""broken remainings of my soul,"" ""pain."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not by name.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I just want to disappear"" is a direct expression of wanting to cease to exist, which is a form of suicidal ideation. ""Free from all this pain"" in this context reinforces the desire for an end to suffering, often interpreted as an end to life.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention/feeling (""I just want to disappear"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I just want to disappear"" implies a desire to not be alive/exist) and deep emotional pain, but there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act, nor any past attempts or self-harm behavior. This fits the definition of 'ideation'. It's more than just an 'indicator' because the desire to ""disappear"" is a direct expression of wanting to cease to exist.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide""
   - Emotional indicators: The rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" indicates despair and a strong consideration of suicide.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I just need a plan for suicide"" explicitly states a need for a plan, indicating a desire to formulate one.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" and the desire for a suicide plan.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I just need a plan for suicide"" is a strong sign of *seeking* preparation or *intending* to prepare. It indicates a clear tendency to move towards action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"", ""I just need a plan for suicide"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression that is not resolved.
   - 'ideation': Incorrect. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the phrase ""I just need a plan for suicide"" goes beyond mere ideation. It indicates a clear *tendency* or active desire to move towards acting out suicide by seeking a plan.
   - 'behavior': This category fits best. The post has explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"", ""suicide"") and a clear ""tendency to act out suicide"" by actively stating the need for a plan. This shows a progression beyond just thinking about it, into actively seeking the means or steps to carry it out.
   - 'attempt': Incorrect, as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me.

   - Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""don't want to leave my cats/friends"", ""pussy"" (self-deprecating), ""urge"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""blow my brains out"", ""pull the trigger"" (implies a gun). However, the post explicitly states ""I can never bring myself to actually do it"" and ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"", indicating a *lack* of preparation or immediate intent to act.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned; rather, the post describes a continuous struggle with the *urge* and an *inability* to act on it.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I want to kill myself"", ""blow my brains out"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to kill myself"", ""urge to just blow my brains out"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post explicitly states the *lack* of ability to act: ""I can never bring myself to actually do it"" and ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/ongoing urges and thoughts (""every single day I still have the urge"", ""I lay in bed at night, thoughts... rushing through my head""). It explicitly states no past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression (""I want to kill myself"", ""urge to just blow my brains out""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - A method is mentioned (""blow my brains out"", ""pull the trigger"").
   - However, the crucial part is the explicit statement that there is *no tendency to act*: ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it."" This directly contradicts the ""tendency to act out"" requirement for 'behavior'.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'ideation' because it has explicit suicidal expression, a method is identified, but there is no plan *or tendency* to commit suicide, as explicitly stated by the user's inability to act on the urges.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""kill me"", ""i'll dm the address"", ""please come here"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by proposing a specific method (""murder me"") and showing a clear tendency/plan to facilitate it by offering to provide a location (""i'll dm the address"").

I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

   - A specific method (""hanging myself"") is identified.
   - There is clear evidence of a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through the repeated ""practicing"" and ""training"" described. This goes beyond mere ideation and indicates active preparation and rehearsal for suicide. The ""practicing"" itself can be considered a form of self-harm behavior in preparation for suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die."", ""I want to disappear."", ""I will take myself away from here""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The phrase ""I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"" strongly indicates a *tendency* to act out suicide, even without a specific plan or method. The ""on the edge"" part suggests a critical state.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'ideation' states ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This post *does* show a tendency.
        *   'behavior' states ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" This aligns with the explicit suicidal expression and the clear *tendency* to act (""I am on the edge"", ""one day i will take myself away"").
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.

    Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit due to the explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear tendency to act, even in the absence of a detailed plan.

   - The definition of 'indicator' includes ""no explicit suicidal expression"" or ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" The explicit denial (""Im not suicidal"") fits this description, as the user is stating they are *not* suicidal, despite feeling overwhelmed. The desire ""not to exist"" is an expression of despair, but the immediate qualification removes it from being an explicit suicidal expression of intent.

Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, the post explicitly states, ""I attempted suicide last week"" and ""(Un)fortunately my attempt had failed.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The user states, ""I want to take my life,"" ""I am suicidal,"" and ""I attempted suicide last week.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I dont know what I truly want besides death.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for a *future* attempt is mentioned. The post refers to the *preparation* (drafting a note) for the *past* attempt.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? For the *past* attempt, yes (drafting a note). No signs of preparation for an *immediate, new* attempt are described.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a clear *past event* (""I attempted suicide last week"") and its *failed outcome*. It also expresses *current* suicidal ideation (""I want to take my life,"" ""I am yet again back to square one"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note... (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed.""

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill you"", ""I just want this nightmare to end"" (implies wanting to die).
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"", ""I just want this nightmare to end"" (fear, despair, hopelessness).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""valium"" (method), ""I haven't taken enough"" (implies an action has already been taken with the method).
   - References to past attempts: ""I haven't taken enough"" strongly suggests a very recent or ongoing attempt that the person fears was unsuccessful.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill you"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want this nightmare to end"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""valium"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that the method (valium) has already been acquired and *taken*. This is beyond preparation; it's an action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I haven't taken enough"" refers to a very recent or ongoing action. The question ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" suggests a current state of being under the influence or having just taken it, and seeking information to complete the act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" directly describes a recent action that the person considers an attempt, and fears its failure.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill you"") and a method (""valium"").
   - Crucially, the phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that an action has already been performed with the intent to die. This is not just ideation (thoughts) or behavior (planning/tendency), but an actual *attempt* that the person believes might be insufficient.
   - This directly aligns with the definition of 'attempt': ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt"".

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, in vivid detail, including specific dates (e.g., ""November 2020"") and methods.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit and detailed descriptions of multiple historical suicide attempts. The definition for 'attempt' is: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This post perfectly aligns with the latter part of this definition. While there is also an expression of current ideation (""I don't want to live at all""), the overwhelming and most significant content is the recounting of past suicide attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""kill myself"", ""ready to be done"", ""put a belt around my neck"", ""so close to just doing it"".

These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and a desire for an end to suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight."" This describes a specific method (strangulation/hanging) and a location, and an action taken.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The described action (""put a belt around my neck, and sat down... Right before I passed out, I stopped"") is a *recent* self-harm *behavior* that was interrupted by the individual, not a completed attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""ready to be done"", ""so close to just doing it"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""ready to be done"", ""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight."" This is a detailed description of a method and location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of putting the belt around the neck and sitting down against the doorknob is a clear sign of preparation and *acting out* the suicidal intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a *recent* event (""tonight"") where the person *acted out* a method, and expresses *current* strong suicidal intent (""I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The described action was interrupted by the individual themselves (""Right before I passed out, I stopped""). This is a serious self-harm *behavior* that came very close to an attempt, but was not a completed attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression and a clear action taken.
    *   'ideation': Incorrect. There is not only explicit suicidal expression but also a specific plan and a recent action taken towards that plan.
    *   'behavior': This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" This fits perfectly. The post has explicit suicidal expression, a clear plan/method, and describes a recent action taken (""put a belt around my neck, and sat down..."") which demonstrates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" The fact that it was self-interrupted means it falls under 'behavior' rather than 'attempt'.
    *   'attempt': Incorrect. The post explicitly states, ""Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This indicates the action was *interrupted* by the individual before it became a completed attempt or required external intervention. It was a very serious *behavior* that came extremely close, but was not a completed attempt.

   - Emotional indicators: ""no body cares"", ""no motivation"", ""fucking yo my future"", ""fucked myself over"", ""parents don't even care"", ""no one left to turn to"", ""don't feel like anything anymore it's just blank"". These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, isolation, and apathy.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"" are specific methods being considered or wished for. No explicit preparation is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds"" is a direct expression of a wish to die by specific means.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current feelings and future intentions/wishes (""i just wish i could..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post not only expresses a wish to die but also mentions specific methods (""get hit by a car"", ""od on meds""). This goes beyond mere 'ideation' (which states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide""). The mention of specific methods indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, which would classify it as 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal expression and the mention of specific methods (indicating a tendency to act out) best fits the 'behavior' category.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i'm better off dead"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i'm better off dead"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""overdose"", ""took 44 paracetamol"", ""don't think I want to die but something is stopping me cllng 999"", ""could I survive an od like this"", ""I did this to myself"". This clearly indicates an act of self-harm/suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""sorry if this is the wrong subreddit"", ""I don't know where else to post/ask this"", ""my stomach is hurting very badly"", ""sweating badly and shaking too"", ""I feel like a burden"". These show distress, physical symptoms, and feelings of worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"". This is a specific method and a completed action.
   - References to past attempts: The post describes a *current/very recent* event (""almost an hour ago""), not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of an ""overdose"" and asking about survival from it.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The user states ""I don't think I want to die"", but the *action* taken (taking 44 paracetamol) and the subsequent physical distress and question about survival from an ""od"" (overdose) clearly describe a suicide attempt. The intent might be conflicted, but the act is undeniable.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""took 44 paracetamol"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act has already been carried out.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a very recent past event (""almost an hour ago"") and its ongoing physical consequences in the present.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, this is a description of a *current/very recent* attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes an explicit action (""took 44 paracetamol"") that constitutes an overdose, which is a form of suicide attempt. The user is experiencing physical symptoms and asking for help/advice regarding the survival of this act. This directly aligns with the definition of 'attempt' which includes ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrases ""I really can't handle it anymore"" and ""feels completely hopeless"" convey extreme distress and a lack of coping, but not a direct wish for death or non-existence.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses profound emotional pain, hopelessness, and an inability to cope with life's challenges (""I really can't handle it anymore,"" ""feels completely hopeless""). It's a clear cry for help and describes a state that could precede suicidal ideation. However, it *lacks explicit suicidal expression* such as ""I want to die,"" ""I'm thinking of suicide,"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive."" It describes the *conditions* and *feelings* that are strong indicators of suicide risk, but not the explicit ideation itself. Therefore, it aligns with the 'indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death"" is present. However, this is a philosophical statement about the lowest point in life, not an expression of personal suicidal intent or desire. There are no mentions of suicide or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: ""lonely and lost as ever,"" ""scares me sometimes,"" ""really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns."" However, these are balanced by positive statements like ""overall better compared to the rest of my life,"" ""feel more like myself,"" ""starting to accept who I am,"" ""in therapy again btw so it might get better for me,"" and encouraging others to ""stay positive and stay safe.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None. The ""rock bottom"" description refers to mental health breakdowns and physical symptoms (""puking everyday""), not suicide attempts or self-harm. ""almost being abusive"" refers to a tendency, not self-harm.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?

The mention of ""death"" is in the context of a past ""rock bottom"" and a general philosophical statement, not a current intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post does not contain any explicit suicidal expression, nor does it describe past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors. While it mentions past severe mental health struggles, the overall tone is one of improvement, acceptance, and hope, with encouragement for others. The mention of ""death"" is a metaphorical description of hitting rock bottom, not a personal suicidal thought. Therefore, it fits the 'indicator' category.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts"", ""attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"", ""begun having those thoughts again"".

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned for current suicidal thoughts. The person is actively seeking help.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"", ""attempted suicide"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct current expression of wanting to die, but mentions ""begun having those thoughts again"". The focus is on the struggle with seeking help and confiding, not immediate intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No. The person is seeking help and setting up appointments.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to past events (""attempted suicide in the past"") and current feelings/thoughts (""begun having those thoughts again""). The current intention is to seek help.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** Yes, ""attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts"", ""begun having those thoughts again""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no current plan or tendency to commit suicide, which would lean towards 'ideation' for the current state.
    *   However, the post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"".
    *   The definition for 'attempt' is: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
    *   This directly matches the mention of a historical suicide attempt. While the post also contains elements of 'ideation' (current suicidal thoughts without a plan) and could fall under 'behavior' if a suicide attempt is considered a form of self-harm behavior, the 'attempt' category specifically and most accurately covers the explicit mention of a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"". This is the highest risk factor explicitly stated and directly matches a category definition.

    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) and ""I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""I can't socialize well,"" ""suffering,"" ""afraid he won't want baggage like me and leave,"" ""go insane,"" ""so many issues,"" ""depression,"" ""It's getting to be too much.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method, ""cut,"" is mentioned as a preferred coping mechanism. While the user states they ""can't even cut"" currently, this indicates a strong tendency or past reliance on this method.
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. The phrase ""thoughts of sh"" and ""I can't even cut... so I can't even cope in the way that works best"" suggests an ongoing struggle and a preferred behavioral coping mechanism, possibly with past experience.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not directly.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expressions of wanting to die. However, there is explicit mention of ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut"" is mentioned as a method of self-harm.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of immediate preparation, but the mention of ""cut"" as the way that ""works best"" implies a strong inclination or past use of this method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""thoughts of sh"" and ""I can't even cut... so I can't even cope in the way that works best"" refer to current/ongoing struggles and a current desire/tendency for self-harm, even if currently inhibited. ""It's getting to be too much"" indicates escalating current distress.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator' is incorrect because there is explicit mention of self-harm.
    *   'ideation' involves explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency. This post goes beyond mere thoughts; it mentions a specific method (""cut"") as the ""way that works best"" for coping, indicating a strong tendency or past behavioral pattern related to self-harm.
    *   'behavior' includes explicit self-harm expression and a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of sh"" and identifies ""cut"" as the ""way that works best"" for coping. This strongly suggests a tendency to act out self-harm or a historical experience with it, even if currently inhibited. The desire to engage in a specific self-harm behavior for coping fits the ""tendency to act out self-harm"" part of this definition.
    *   'attempt' is incorrect as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification due to the explicit mention of self-harm thoughts and the identification of a specific self-harm method (""cut"") as the preferred coping mechanism, indicating a strong tendency or past behavioral pattern.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""don't want to live"", ""goodbye""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""don't care about anything anymore"", ""life is all downhill"", ""my career dreams are ruined"", ""I'll never have kids"", ""I have nothing in my life"" (extreme hopelessness, despair, finality).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I finally decided to take the leap"" indicates a firm decision to act. ""goodbye"" suggests imminent action and farewell. While a specific method (e.g., ""I'm going to jump off a bridge"") isn't explicitly detailed, the phrase ""take the leap"" combined with the decision and farewell implies a concrete intention to act.
    *   References to past attempts: ""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"" implies past suicidal ideation or intent that was delayed, but not a past *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I don't want to live"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit method (like a specific tool or location) is detailed. However, ""take the leap"" signifies a decided action, and ""goodbye"" indicates preparation for imminent action. This goes beyond mere contemplation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I finally decided to take the leap"" indicates a firm decision and intent to act. The ""goodbye"" is a strong sign of preparation for a final act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a current decision and future intention (""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself""). The mention of ""a month longer"" refers to past ideation that was prolonged, but the current post is about a new, firm decision.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, past *attempts* are not described. Past *ideation* or *intent* that was delayed is mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** Incorrect. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post clearly indicates a ""tendency to commit suicide"" and a firm decision to act (""I finally decided to take the leap""), which goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts without a plan or tendency to act). The ""goodbye"" reinforces this.
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best. The post has explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"") and there is a clear ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" (""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"", ""goodbye""). The decision to act is firm, even if a specific method isn't detailed. The ""goodbye"" implies imminent action.
    *   **attempt:** Incorrect. The post describes a future intention/decision, not a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"", ""Goodbye"". These phrases strongly indicate suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel so relaxed that it's finally ending"" suggests a sense of relief from a decision made, pointing towards a definitive plan.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all"" implies a final act or preparation before an imminent suicidal action. While no specific method is stated, the ""one last time"" indicates preparation and imminence.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Phrases like ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"" are direct expressions of wanting to die or end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, location) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" is a clear sign of preparation for a final act, indicating a definitive decision and imminent intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. ""before i end it all"", ""before i call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"" all point to an imminent future action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
   - The phrase ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all"" strongly suggests a definitive decision and an imminent action, indicating a ""tendency to act out suicide"" even without a specific method being named. This goes beyond mere ideation and points towards a behavioral component (preparation/imminent intent).
   - It does not describe a past or recent suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the ""behavior"" category which includes explicit suicidal expression and a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""she had tried to kill herself"" (referring to another person).
   - Emotional indicators: The poster expresses ""I need help"" and ""I'm scared"". These are emotions of concern and distress, not suicidal despair from the poster themselves.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, for the other person.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The crucial rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".
   - The person writing the post (""I"") is expressing concern and seeking help *for another person* who has attempted suicide.
   - The post itself does not contain any explicit suicidal expression, ideation, behavior, or attempt from the *poster*. The poster's content is a cry for help regarding someone else's well-being.
   - Therefore, the post content has no explicit suicidal expression from the person writing it. This aligns with the definition of 'indicator'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""I will hang myself now"", ""I'm now looking for"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past *suicide attempts* are described. Past *self-harm behavior* is mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression (""I will hang myself now""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is not only explicit suicidal expression but also a clear plan (""hang myself"") and active steps towards preparation (""looking for something that I can tie"", assessing its strength). This indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - The post also mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"").
   - There is no mention of a *recent* or *historical suicide attempt*.
   - Therefore, the 'behavior' category is the best fit as it includes explicit suicidal expression, a plan/tendency to act, and historical self-harm behavior.

You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious.

Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (likely 'die'), ""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicidal courage and determination"", ""If you change your mind and you want to do it"", ""Go out with bang, and big flames"", ""Let the world know that you considered yourself normal, it is the world that wronged you and the world is wrong, not you.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""DEPRESSED"", ""frightened"", ""coward"", ""Everyone hates themselves"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details methods for causing large-scale destruction (""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem"", ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home"", ""research where to find the parts for cheap also"", ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best""). While these are framed as acts of ""mayhem"" against the world, they are presented as the author's way to ""Go out with bang, and big flames"" if they ""want to do it"" (referring to the earlier ""I WANT TO DOIE""). This implies a plan for a destructive act that would result in the author's death.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I WANT TO DOIE"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicidal courage and determination"", ""If you change your mind and you want to do it"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I WANT TO DOIE"").

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I WANT TO DOIE""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing specific, destructive actions that are presented as the author's way of ""going out"" if they decide to act on their desire to die. These detailed steps for causing ""mayhem"" and ""big flames"" constitute a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide,"" even if the method involves external destruction leading to their own death.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post is written by a concerned friend about another person (the best friend) who is being severely bullied.
   - The phrase ""go kill yourself"" is a direct quote from the bully, not an expression of suicidal intent by the friend or the poster.
   - While the friend is experiencing significant distress, the post does not contain any explicit suicidal expression from the person writing the post, nor does it explicitly state the friend is expressing suicidal thoughts or intentions. The focus of the post is seeking help to stop the bullying.
   - According to the rules, ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"". The poster is seeking help for their friend, not expressing their own suicidal thoughts. The friend's distress is described, but not their suicidal ideation.

I'm sad right now and I want nothing more than someone to sit with me in silence while I cry. But I'm alone. I can't reach out. So all I ask is this, please check up on me later.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm at the end of my rope"", ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through"", ""I know this is going to be another failure"", ""I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"", ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""Everything's crumbling"", ""I don't see a reason"", ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting"", ""scared"", ""sad"", ""alone"", ""can't reach out"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No explicit method or plan is mentioned. However, ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting"" suggests a current physical state that could be a result of an action.
   - References to past attempts: ""I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" and ""I know this is going to be another failure"" strongly indicate past actions with suicidal intent that were not fatal.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through"" implies a desire to die but being held back by fear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
     - Past: ""I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" ""I know this is going to be another failure."" ""I knew this morning the moment I woke up that it would lead to this.""
     - Current/Future: ""I'm at the end of my rope right now."" ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting."" ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through."" ""I know I'll wake up later."" ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" ""Please check up on me later.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"").
   - The phrases ""I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" and ""I know this is going to be another failure"" are critical. These indicate a *historical experience* of an action that was intended to cause death but failed. The term ""failure"" implies an unmet intent, which is characteristic of a suicide attempt. The current physical symptoms (""breath slowing down, chest hurting"") combined with the past experiences and the underlying desire not to wake up, strongly suggest a pattern of actions with suicidal intent.
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'behavior' includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
     - 'attempt' includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
   - Given the explicit desire not to wake up (""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"") and the description of past ""failures"" where the person ""knows I'll wake up"" after ""doing this before,"" the historical actions described are best classified as suicide attempts rather than just self-harm behavior without suicidal intent. The current state also suggests an ongoing or very recent action that is part of this pattern.

This directly matches the definition of 'attempt': ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The fact that the person is ""doing better now"" does not negate the description of the past attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end"" and ""my end will only get nearer.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""deepest depths of myself and darkest corners,"" ""deeper than I've ever been.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific suicide plan or method is mentioned. The mention of ""take a few tabs of acid"" is presented as an *alternative* or a last resort to *prevent* suicide, not a method of suicide itself. The user states, ""if it helps me then hey that's great, if it doesn't, I'll be back in the same spot or worse off than before and my end will only get nearer."" This indicates a contemplation of suicide as a future outcome if the alternative fails, but not a current plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. ""pulled me from the deepest depths"" refers to past struggles with mental state, not past suicidal *behavior* or *attempts*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" and ""my end will only get nearer.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly through the acceptance of ""my end will only get nearer"" and being ""fine with either outcome"" (referring to the outcome of LSD helping or not, where not helping leads to ""my end"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *suicide* methods are mentioned. LSD is mentioned as a potential coping mechanism or last resort *before* suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end"" indicates current and ongoing suicidal thoughts. ""my end will only get nearer"" refers to a future intention/outcome if the current coping strategy (LSD) fails.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""thinking of suicide for months on end"", ""my end will only get nearer""), which rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no specific plan or method for suicide mentioned. The user is contemplating suicide as a future possibility if their current attempt to cope (using LSD) fails, but they are not describing a current plan or immediate tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.
    *   There is no mention of historical self-harm *behavior* or *suicide attempts*. The past ""deepest depths"" refers to a mental state, not an action.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation' as it has explicit suicidal expression but no plan or immediate tendency to commit suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None explicitly.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hit a new low tonight,"" ""havent felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feeling lost.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Stole prescription hydrocodone and consumed alcohol ""just to feel ok for one night."" This describes substance abuse as a coping mechanism for emotional pain.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The stated purpose of taking the substances is ""to feel ok,"" not to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hydrocodone and alcohol.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, stealing the hydrocodone. However, the intent is explicitly stated as ""to feel ok,"" not to commit suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current distress and actions (""tonight,"" ""havent felt ok in a while""). The actions are current coping mechanisms.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a person in severe emotional distress (""hit a new low,"" ""havent felt ok in a while"") who is engaging in self-medication/substance abuse (stole hydrocodone, drank alcohol) to cope, with the explicit goal of ""feeling ok."" There is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal plan or intent. The actions described, while concerning and potentially dangerous, are framed as an attempt to alleviate emotional pain, not to end life. This aligns with the 'indicator' category, which covers posts with no explicit suicidal expression but indicate distress or resolved suicidal issues.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I see no point in living anymore"" directly expresses a desire not to continue living, which is a form of suicidal ideation.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I see no point in living anymore,"" ""I don't have any friends,"" ""Nothing in my life is working out"" indicate hopelessness, despair, loneliness, and a sense of failure.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.

   - Emotional indicators: ""fucked up I am"", ""unfair on them"", ""guilty"", ""sorry"". These indicate distress, guilt, and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a specific method (pills) and indicates an action has already been taken.
   - References to past attempts: The phrasing ""taken a fuck load of pills"" suggests a *current* or *very recent* action, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""might not wake up tomorrow"" is a direct expression of the potential outcome of dying. ""taken a fuck load of pills"" implies an action taken with the intent to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills"" and ""a fuck load of pills"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post states ""taken a fuck load of pills"", which implies the act of acquiring and ingesting them has already occurred. This is beyond preparation; it describes the act itself.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is past tense, indicating an action that *just happened* or is *currently happening*. ""might not wake up tomorrow"" refers to a future consequence of this *recent* action. This strongly points to a recent attempt.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, this describes a *current/recent* event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes an action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") with a clear intent/outcome (""might not wake up tomorrow""). This indicates a completed or ongoing action aimed at ending life.
   - 'indicator' is incorrect as there is explicit suicidal expression and action.
   - 'ideation' is incorrect as there is not just expression, but a described action.
   - 'behavior' covers self-harm or a plan/tendency. While taking pills is a behavior, the context ""might not wake up tomorrow"" elevates it beyond just self-harm to an attempt to end life.
   - 'attempt' specifically covers ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt"". The phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" perfectly fits this description of a recent suicide attempt.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""failing an attempt once again"" directly describes a historical suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It describes a clear plan and tendency to act out suicide in the near future (""planning out my suicide"", ""January 1st""). This aligns with the 'behavior' category.
    *   Crucially, the post also mentions a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" with the phrase ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" and ""do it right this time"". This directly matches the definition for the 'attempt' category: ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
    *   Since the post explicitly states a past suicide attempt, the 'attempt' category is the most accurate and specific classification, as it directly addresses this critical element. While there is also a current plan (which could fit 'behavior'), the presence of a past *attempt* is the defining characteristic for the 'attempt' category.

    *   The post explicitly uses the phrase ""attempt suicide"" to describe historical, repeated actions.
    *   The definition of 'attempt' includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
    *   While the actions are described as ""half-hearted"" and with a safety mechanism (""so i don't die""), the user's own labeling of these actions as ""attempt suicide"" directly aligns with the 'attempt' category's criteria for historical experience. The act of hanging oneself, even with a safety net, is a direct simulation of a suicide method and is a serious self-harm behavior that the user identifies as an ""attempt"".

136,"I wanna move anymore. hey. You don't know me but I figured I could let things out here, my family just had a huge fight over all of our problems and stuff. I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for. Hold on to them. Because life is temporary. And from what I've learned, not everybody gets the happy ending",3,attempt,"<thinking>

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The first sentence ""I am 29 still live with my parents"" suggests potential dissatisfaction or frustration with life circumstances. The subsequent string of random characters and ""fuckkkkkkkk"" indicates strong frustration, anger, or distress. However, these are not direct indicators of suicidal intent.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I've done it many times"" (in the context of ""killing myself""), ""start cutting again"" (implies past cutting behavior).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""killing myself"", ""do it"" in the context of suicide).
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes (""I'll finally do it"", ""I just wish I could die in my sleep instead"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""hang myself"", ""cutting"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" suggests research/planning. ""at the moment there is too much potential interference"" indicates a current desire to act despite obstacles.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Both.
        *   **Past:** ""I've done it many times"" (referring to suicidal actions/attempts), ""start cutting again"" (implies past cutting).
        *   **Current/Future:** ""One of these days I'll finally do it"", ""I'll break killing myself regardless"", ""at the moment there is too much potential interference"" (current intent, future action), ""Maybe I'll get lucky and increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again"" (future action).
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** ""I've done it many times"" directly follows ""I'm not afraid of killing myself anymore"", strongly implying past suicide attempts or very serious suicidal actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing myself"", ""I'll finally do it"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: The question implies a serious contemplation of suicide.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific method being inquired about. This indicates an exploration of a concrete means.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The question ""Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?"" is a direct inquiry into the feasibility of a specific suicide method, implying a desire or consideration to act.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""charcoal bbq in a tent"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The question is about the *possibility* of using this method, which is a step towards understanding or potentially preparing. It's not just a general thought, but an inquiry into the practicalities of a specific means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention (exploring a method for suicide).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicide"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by inquiring about the *possibility* and *method* (""charcoal bbq in a tent""). This indicates a concrete exploration of a means to commit suicide, which falls under ""plan or tendency to act out"" rather than just abstract ideation. It's not just ""I want to die,"" but ""Can I die using X specific method?"" This level of specificity and inquiry about a method suggests a tendency towards action or the initial stages of planning.
   - It does not mention a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category as it signifies explicit suicidal expression with a tendency to act out or explore a plan.

I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to die"", ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me"", ""don't feel like actually committing die"" (likely a typo for 'suicide' or 'dying').
   - Emotional indicators: ""not worth it"", ""everything about me is wrong"", ""alone"", ""feel worst about"", ""terrible relationship with my body"", ""hate everything about how I look"", ""self loathing"", ""embarrassment"", ""don't deserve anything"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and low self-worth.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""want to die"" and ""don't feel like actually committing die"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""want to die"", ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and future outlook (""alone for the rest of my life"", ""don't think I'll escape it"", ""don't think I'll ever be good enough""). The desire to die is current.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""want to die"", ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post explicitly states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die"". This indicates a lack of immediate plan or tendency to act on the suicidal thoughts, despite the presence of the thoughts themselves.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, nor any historical self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - Based on the definition, 'ideation' fits best: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" The ""want to die"" is the explicit expression, and the ""don't feel like actually committing die"" confirms the lack of plan or tendency to act.

147,My heart hurts and I want to die. My long term bf and I got into a bad fight. All because I thought I asked a harmless question and it spiraled. Usually when we fight we always end positively but this time it felt different. It ended badly. It was more let's just forget this happened. We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time. I loved him so much and felt so lucky to be with him. I don't really know what to do. I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down. It hurts so much and I just feel like dying. I just wish I had someone to talk to,1,ideation,"<thinking>

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I can't do it anymore."" and uses the extended metaphor of a ""sick dog"" that ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down."" and ""It sounds weird hearing the 'dog' put itself down."" This strongly implies suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired,"" ""can't find a way to release,"" ""can't find a way to fix them. Fix myself. anything,"" ""abomination,"" ""What is wrong with me."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" This sets a deadline or a conditional timeframe for a decision. The ""put down"" metaphor implies a method of ending life, though not a specific tool.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None explicitly mentioned for the user.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't do it anymore"" and the ""put down"" metaphor clearly express a desire to end their life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The method is implied by ""put down"" (euthanasia, applied to self), but no specific tool or location is given.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around"" indicates a conditional timeframe for a decision or action, which can be interpreted as a form of planning or a deadline for a potential act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around"" and ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down"" refer to current and future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression through metaphor (""put down,"" ""can't do it anymore"").
    *   The phrase ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around"" indicates a conditional plan or a deadline for a potential action. This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) and suggests a *tendency to act* if the situation does not improve within the specified timeframe. The ""put down"" metaphor, while not a concrete method, clearly conveys the intent to end life. This combination of explicit expression and a conditional timeframe/tendency to act aligns with the 'behavior' category.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times (""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide seriously,"" ""suicide pact,"" ""my demise"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""horrid hole of thoughts,"" ""torment of thoughts,"" ""tired,"" ""delicate,"" ""weak,"" ""can't 'click' into life.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" This is a significant preparatory action. While no specific *method* is detailed, the mention of ""plotting"" for months suggests a level of planning. The negations (""I would never involve someone else... I wouldn't have anyone find me... I would never use a weapon from my household"") indicate consideration of methods and scenarios.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. The ""plotting"" has been ""on and off for months,"" referring to ongoing ideation and planning, not past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the underlying sentiment of ""why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation"" and ""I just can't 'click' into life"" implies a desire not to be alive, despite the current feeling of being ""out of my hole for now.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is detailed, but the post mentions *avoiding* certain methods (""never use a weapon from my household""), implying consideration.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" is a clear sign of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""plotting"" has been ""on and off for months"" (past/ongoing). ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" (recent action). ""Today, I feel better. I am out of my hole for now. I don't think I would do 'it'."" (Current state of reduced immediate intent, but the history of plotting and recent preparation are significant). The underlying ""torment of thoughts"" is still present, though manageable.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Not 'indicator' because there is explicit suicidal expression and concrete preparatory actions, not just resolved issues.
    *   **ideation:** While there is clear ideation, the post goes beyond mere thoughts. The act of ""drafted my will"" is a concrete preparatory step.
    *   **behavior:** This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   Explicit suicidal expression: Yes.
        *   Plan or tendency to act out: Yes. ""Plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months"" indicates a tendency to plan. More importantly, ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" is a direct preparatory *behavior* related to suicide. This action signifies a step towards acting out, even if the immediate intent is currently low.
        *   Historical experience of self-harm behaviour: No explicit self-harm behavior or past attempts are mentioned.
    *   **attempt:** No mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    The key element pushing this into 'behavior' is the explicit mention of ""drafted my will,"" which is a concrete preparatory action, indicating a ""tendency to act out"" or a ""plan,"" even if the immediate risk is stated to be lower at the moment of writing.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is present. This suggests feelings of being a burden or worthlessness, which can be associated with suicidal ideation, but it is not an explicit statement of wanting to die or commit suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i hate tough love,"" ""stressed,"" ""not in a good mood,"" ""brings me anxiety,"" ""sick of this endless myopic bouts of 'criticism',"" ""feeling depressed,"" ""abused enough at home,"" ""i want it to stop,"" ""if i leave them i have no one.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions like ""I want to die"" or ""I'm going to kill myself."" The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is an indirect expression of feeling like a burden, not a direct statement of suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current distress and feelings (""today Z started mocking me,"" ""i feel like,"" ""i am so sick of this,"" ""i want it to stop"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses significant emotional distress, feelings of being a burden, and a desire for the current painful situation to stop.
    *   However, there is *no explicit suicidal expression* (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself""). The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" indicates severe distress and potential risk, but it is an indirect statement about the speaker's perceived value to others, not a direct statement of suicidal intent or desire for death.
    *   There are no mentions of plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
    *   Based on the definitions, 'ideation' requires *explicit* suicidal expression. Since the expression is indirect and focuses on feeling like a burden rather than a direct desire for death, it does not meet the ""explicit suicidal expression"" criteria for 'ideation'. It indicates a high level of distress and potential risk, which aligns with the 'indicator' category.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped (""walls are closing in and there's no escape""). These are strong indicators of mental health struggles.
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly states, ""I don't want to kill myself."" While it mentions suicide, it negates the intent. It also expresses a desire to ""give life a chance"" and improve their current situation, rather than end it.
    *   There is no explicit suicidal expression (i.e., wanting to die), no plan, no tendency to act, and no mention of past self-harm or attempts.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, a specific time (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") and a potential pre-suicidal action (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"") are mentioned, indicating a tendency to act out or a preliminary plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I probably will hit up everyone"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific time (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") and a potential pre-suicidal action (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out""), which indicates a plan or tendency to act out. This rules out 'ideation'.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal expression combined with a specific time frame and a tendency/preliminary plan to act out fits the definition of 'behavior'.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""dead inside"", ""yeet myself way too much"" (colloquial for self-harm/suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""useless life"", ""huge depressive episode"", ""still sad"", ""still anhedonic"", ""beyond saving"", ""want to cry"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method or plan is detailed beyond the general desire to ""yeet myself"". No signs of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Not by the word ""suicide"", but ""yeet myself way too much"" is a strong, explicit colloquial expression for self-harm or suicide.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""useless life"", ""dead inside"", and particularly ""I just want to... yeet myself way too much"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No, ""yeet myself"" is a general desire, not a specific method (e.g., ""jump"", ""pills"").
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" refers to current strong urges/intentions.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""yeet myself way too much"") and strong expressions of hopelessness and a desire not to be alive (""useless life"", ""dead inside"", ""beyond saving"").
    *   However, there is no specific plan mentioned (e.g., a method, time, or location) nor any indication of steps being taken or a concrete ""tendency to act out"" beyond the strong desire/urge. ""Yeet myself"" is a general expression of a suicidal urge, not a detailed plan or immediate behavioral intention.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation' which states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" It does not meet the criteria for 'behavior' which requires a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

God im such a fucking loser. i could really use someone to talk too. All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all. I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded."" directly refers to a past attempt to end their life (suicide attempt) and a current wish that it had been successful.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i fucked up this time,"" ""God im such a fucking loser,"" ""All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all."" These indicate feelings of failure, self-loathing, isolation, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No current plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I tried to end it once before."" This is an explicit mention of a historical suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""end it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" (referring to the past attempt to ""end it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The core suicidal content (""I tried to end it once before"") refers to a *past* event. The ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" refers to a *current wish* about that past event, indicating ongoing distress and a desire for death. There are no current plans or intentions to act.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I tried to end it once before.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression and a past attempt.
    *   **ideation:** Ruled out because the post explicitly mentions a *past attempt*, which goes beyond mere ideation without a plan or tendency.
    *   **behavior:** This category includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" A suicide attempt is a form of self-harm behavior.
    *   **attempt:** This category includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The phrase ""I tried to end it once before"" directly and explicitly states a historical suicide attempt. This is the most precise fit.

    Comparing 'behavior' and 'attempt' for historical context: 'behavior' mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour,"" while 'attempt' specifically mentions ""historical experience of suicide attempt."" Since the post explicitly describes a past *suicide attempt* (""tried to end it""), the 'attempt' category is the most accurate and specific classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

I'll never be happy if I continue to live but I'm angry also because if it weren't for my situation I would be happy to continue living. So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""planning to commit suicide"", ""end it"", and ""have to go"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""genuinely upset"", ""can't change my circumstances"", ""never be happy"", ""miserable"", ""angry"", ""sad"", ""missing out"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tool, location, substance) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to past attempts are present.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/future intentions (""planning to commit suicide"", ""have to go"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""planning to commit suicide"", ""end it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The key distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.
        *   'ideation' is defined as ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
        *   'behavior' is defined as ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
    *   The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" directly indicates a ""tendency to act out"" or a nascent ""plan"", even if the specific method is not detailed. The user states they ""have to go"" and have ""no choice but to end it,"" which signifies a strong inclination towards action rather than just a passive thought.
    *   Since there is an explicit expression of suicide and a clear tendency/intention to act (implied by ""planning"" and ""have to go""), it fits the 'behavior' category. It does not mention a past attempt, so it's not 'attempt'.

I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""attempting suicide"" twice and ""so close to attempting suicide"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""regretting it immensely"", ""not mentally stable enough"", ""mortifying and embarrassing"", ""want to rip my hair out"", ""do not like living with them"", ""feel nauseous"", ""dreading this"", ""cannot stand living with my family"". These indicate significant distress, regret, and discomfort with the current situation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans or methods for *current or future* suicide are mentioned. The mention of ""going through with attempting suicide"" refers to a past alternative that was *not* chosen.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post states, ""I was so close to attempting suicide but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am..."" This describes a past near-attempt or strong suicidal intent that was *averted* by reaching out. It also says, ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide,"" indicating a past choice was made *against* attempting suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes. (""attempting suicide"", ""so close to attempting suicide"")
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions of *current* desire to die or not be alive. The expressions relate to a *past* decision point where suicide was an option, but was averted.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No. The post describes *averting* a potential attempt by reaching out.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post primarily describes a *past* critical decision point (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"") and a *past* state of being (""I was so close to attempting suicide""). The current situation (moving back home, dropping out of college) is presented as the *consequence* of *not* attempting suicide, but rather reaching out. There is no indication of *current* suicidal intent or future plans to attempt suicide. The distress is about the *consequences* of the past decision.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide, but it describes a situation where a potential suicide attempt was *averted* or *resolved* by reaching out to family. The phrase ""I was so close to attempting suicide but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am..."" clearly indicates that the attempt was *not* made and the suicidal crisis was *resolved* through intervention. The current distress is about the negative consequences of that resolution (moving back home), not about ongoing suicidal ideation or intent. This fits the definition of 'indicator' which includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" It does not describe a current plan or tendency ('behavior'), nor an actual past attempt ('attempt'), nor current explicit suicidal expression without a plan ('ideation').

161,I cant take it. I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity. Its excruciating,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"". There is no mention of self-harm in the suicidal sense, but a desire to ""scream and break everything in my vicinity"" which indicates extreme distress and potential for destructive behavior.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it"", ""the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity"", ""Its excruciating"". These indicate severe emotional and physical pain, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for suicide. The desire to ""scream and break everything"" is a reaction to pain, not a suicide plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I wont kill myself of course"". This is an explicit *denial* of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post explicitly states the opposite.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current emotional state and a stated current/future intention regarding suicide (denial).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit statement: ""I wont kill myself of course"". This directly addresses and denies suicidal intent.
   - The 'indicator' category includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues"". While the pain is severe, the suicidal ideation is explicitly stated as not being acted upon or intended. The user is expressing extreme distress but explicitly ruling out suicide.
   - The other categories ('ideation', 'behavior', 'attempt') require explicit suicidal expression or intent, which is negated by the post.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Note emotional indicators: ""I wish I could stop obsessing"", ""intensified my gender dysphoria"", ""I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing."" These indicate distress, discomfort with gender expression, and gender dysphoria.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current feelings and desires (""I wish"", ""intensified"", ""I hate"", ""I want"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post expresses significant emotional distress and gender dysphoria. However, it *does not contain any explicit suicidal expression*, nor any mention of self-harm, plans, or past attempts. The content describes internal struggles related to identity and appearance, which can be associated with mental health challenges, but it does not meet the criteria for 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt' as defined, which all require explicit suicidal expression or actions. Therefore, it falls under 'indicator' as it has no explicit suicidal expression.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post expresses current feelings of self-hatred and a past desire for courage to ""end it all"". However, it immediately counters this with a current desire to ""endure it all"" and a strong message of hope, resilience, and support for others, indicating a present state of *resisting* suicidal thoughts and choosing to stay. The overall message is one of overcoming and enduring.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""wish I had the courage to end it all""). This initially points away from 'indicator' if it were *only* about no explicit expression.
    *   However, the definition of 'indicator' also includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" The author immediately follows the suicidal thought with ""And yet. I just want the courage to endure it all."" The entire latter half of the post is dedicated to encouraging others to stay, expressing hope (""here I stay. waiting. Because deep down I know this actually is probably true""), and offering support. This strong counter-narrative and explicit choice to ""endure"" and ""stay"" signifies that while suicidal thoughts may have been present, the current state and message of the post are about *resolving* to live and offering hope, rather than actively harboring suicidal intent.
    *   There is no plan or tendency to commit suicide; in fact, the tendency expressed is to *endure* and *stay*. This rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.
    *   While there is explicit suicidal expression, the immediate and dominant context of the post is one of *overcoming* that ideation and choosing to live and support others. This aligns more with the ""resolved suicidal issues"" aspect of 'indicator' than with 'ideation' which implies an *active* suicidal expression without a plan. The post's ultimate message is one of resilience and hope, indicating the suicidal thoughts are being actively resisted and overcome.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""anxiety has gotten much more severe"", ""interfering with almost everything i do"", ""really sick of my family"", ""shitty parents and siblings"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific current plan or method is mentioned. The post explicitly states ""didn't have anything to do it with"" regarding the past near-attempt. However, ""yet i still consider"" indicates ongoing suicidal ideation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"". This describes a very recent, serious near-attempt that was only prevented by lack of means.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""almost committed suicide"", ""still consider"").

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a clear description of a near-suicide attempt (prevented by lack of means) is provided.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression and it's not resolved.
    *   **ideation:** Incorrect. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post goes beyond mere ideation by describing a recent, serious near-attempt.
    *   **behavior:** This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The ""almost committed suicide"" could be seen as a historical experience of self-harm behaviour.
    *   **attempt:** This category includes ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The phrase ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" directly describes a recent, serious near-suicide attempt (an interrupted or thwarted attempt due to lack of means). This fits the definition of a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" more precisely than just ""self-harm behaviour,"" as the intent was clearly lethal. The recency (""a few days ago"") also makes it a ""recent suicide attempt"" in terms of its impact and immediacy.

    Given the explicit mention of ""almost committed suicide"" with lethal intent, which was only prevented by external factors (lack of means), this falls most accurately under the 'attempt' category, specifically as a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" that is very recent.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/future intentions (""can anyone suicide with me together"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression. This rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' is crucial here. 'Behavior' requires a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While the post expresses a strong desire for suicide, it does not detail a specific plan (method, time, location) or describe a concrete ""tendency to act out"" beyond the general desire and call for companionship. It's a general expression of suicidal thoughts and a wish for others to join, rather than a specific, actionable plan or description of self-harm behavior. The lack of a concrete method or preparation points towards ideation.

I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to kms"", ""kill myself"", ""hang myself"", ""killing myself"", ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""can't stop thinking"", ""can't focus on anything except trying again"", ""deserve"", ""burden"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions ""hang myself"" and ""rope"". Describes the action of ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"". Also notes the *lack* of other preparations (packing, resigning, money).
   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"" describes a direct action taken, which is a form of self-harm behavior, even if it was stopped and described as practice.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kms"", ""kill myself"", ""hang myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I really want to hang myself right now"", ""I can't stop thinking about killing myself"", ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"" using ""rope"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"" is a direct action involving the method, indicating a significant step beyond mere ideation or planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to strong current intentions (""I really want to hang myself right now"", ""I can't focus on anything except trying again"", ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"") and a very recent past action (""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The ""practice' hung"" is a described past action that is a self-harm behavior, though not a full suicide attempt as it was stopped.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': No, there is explicit suicidal expression and actions.
   - 'ideation': No, there is explicit suicidal expression *and* a concrete action taken (""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung""), which goes beyond just thoughts or desires.
   - 'behavior': This category fits best. The post has explicit suicidal expression (""I want to kms"", ""hang myself""). There is a clear tendency to act out self-harm or suicide (""I really want to hang myself right now"", ""can't focus on anything except trying again""). Crucially, it mentions a historical experience of self-harm behavior: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"". This is a direct action involving the method, even if it was stopped, classifying it as a self-harm behavior.
   - 'attempt': While the action was very serious, the user describes it as ""practice"" and states they stopped due to fear of failing and ending up in ICU, and because ""nothing is ready"". This indicates it was not a full, committed attempt, but rather a preparatory or simulated action, which falls under 'behavior'.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""finally going to actually do it,"" ""ready to do it,"" ""It's finally fucking time,"" ""violently suicidal,"" ""I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead,"" ""I'll finally be at peace,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more."" Mentions past ""suicidal ideation.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""sobbing for the last few hours,"" ""overwhelmed,"" ""fucking failure,"" ""couldn't stop crying,"" ""couldn't breathe."" Expresses hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" This is a specific method. The phrases ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""finally going to actually do it,"" ""I'm finally ready to do it,"" and ""It's finally fucking time"" indicate a strong decision and immediate intent to act.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past *attempts*, only past ""suicidal ideation.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. (""violently suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I'll be dead"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. (""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more,"" ""I'll finally be at peace"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" While there's some uncertainty about the exact execution (""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun. I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it.""), a specific method is clearly identified as a strong consideration.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The repeated phrases ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""finally ready to do it,"" and ""It's finally fucking time"" strongly suggest a decision has been made and there is an immediate intent to act, which implies preparation or the imminence of action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions. The language is very present-focused regarding the intent to act (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""finally going to actually do it""). Past ""suicidal ideation"" is mentioned, but the core of the post is about current intent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation because it expresses a strong, immediate intent to act (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""finally going to actually do it"") and mentions a specific method (""get a gun"").
   - This aligns with the 'behavior' category description: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide..."" The strong intent and mention of a method constitute a ""plan or tendency to act out."" It does not describe a past or recent attempt, which would be 'attempt'.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""end things"" (euphemism for suicide), ""doesn't want me dead"", ""sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"" (desire for non-existence/escape).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Feeling alone, apathy from others, desire to feel like oneself again, desire for numbness, feeling ""pathetic"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This indicates a specific location chosen and an action taken (driving there) with suicidal intent.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past *attempts*. It describes a recent *intention* and *preparation* that was not acted upon.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""end things"" is a clear euphemism for ending one's life.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""full intentions to end things"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. The desire to ""sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"" also points to a desire for cessation of consciousness/feeling.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** A location (""mountains"") is mentioned in the context of ending things, implying a method related to that location.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" is a significant sign of preparation and intent to act. This is a concrete action taken towards a suicidal goal.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This describes a very recent past event (just finished driving) that involved a strong, immediate intention at that time. The post then states, ""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" indicating a current resolution *against* acting on that specific impulse *now*. However, the *experience* of having driven there with full intention is a past behavioral act.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No, it describes a past *intention and preparation* that was *not completed* into an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** While the post expresses a current resolution (""I don't think I'm going to do it""), the preceding content describes more than just resolved ideation. It describes a concrete action taken with suicidal intent.
    *   **ideation:** This is more than just ideation because a specific action (driving to the mountains) was taken with ""full intentions to end things."" This moves beyond mere thoughts or plans into a behavioral component.
    *   **behavior:** The post explicitly states ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This describes a concrete action taken (driving to a specific location) as part of a suicidal plan, even if the final act was not completed. This fits the ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" or ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (referring to the preparatory action of driving to the location with intent). The act of driving there with intent is a behavioral component.
    *   **attempt:** The user explicitly states ""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" indicating that the act was not completed. Therefore, it was not an attempt.

    The key phrase ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" describes a past action taken with suicidal intent. This constitutes a ""tendency to act out"" or a ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (referring to the preparatory action), placing it in the 'behavior' category, despite the current resolution not to proceed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The language (""I'm ready"", ""date was set"", ""preps being made"", ""ready to go"") indicates an ongoing or imminent plan.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm ready to die"").
   - It clearly indicates a plan and tendency to act out suicide (""The date was set"", ""Preps being made"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go""). This goes beyond mere ideation and points to active steps towards an act.
   - It does not describe a past or recent suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'behavior'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Im thinking of ending my life"") but does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation. It also does not describe any past self-harm behavior or suicide attempts. This aligns directly with the definition of 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""pls let me never wake up"" (desire for death/non-existence), ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" (implying an end to their life/presence).
   - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""its working!"" - This is a critical phrase, indicating that a method or action is currently in progress or has just been initiated.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""pls let me never wake up"" and ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" are direct expressions of wanting to die/not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly, but ""its working!"" strongly implies that a method is being employed or has just been activated. This suggests a concrete plan is being acted upon.
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""its working!"" implies preparation has led to an active step.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""its working!"" refers to a current action. ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up"" refer to future intentions directly resulting from the current action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression and more.
   - 'ideation': Not applicable. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the phrase ""its working!"" indicates more than just thoughts; it suggests a plan is being executed or a method is active, which implies a ""tendency to act out.""
   - 'behavior': This category fits well. There is explicit suicidal expression (""pls let me never wake up"", ""hopefully this is my last post""). Crucially, ""its working!"" signifies a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" It suggests an ongoing action or the initiation of a method, which is a clear behavioral component.
   - 'attempt': While ""its working!"" could be part of an attempt, the post doesn't explicitly state a *recent* or *historical* attempt has occurred (e.g., ""I just attempted"" or ""I tried to...""). It describes an action *in progress* or a method *being used*, which aligns more with the ""tendency to act out"" aspect of 'behavior' rather than a completed or explicitly stated attempt. The post describes the *process* of acting out a plan.

Based on the strong implication of an active method (""its working!"") combined with the explicit desire for death, the post goes beyond mere ideation and indicates a clear ""tendency to act out"" a plan.

    *   The post clearly describes a plan and the acquisition of means (""i have 42 unnamed pills"", ""this time i actually have the means to"", ""tonight im gonna do it""). This goes beyond mere ideation, ruling out 'ideation'.
    *   The post describes explicit suicidal expression and a clear plan/tendency to act out self-harm/suicide by having the means (pills) and stating the intention to use them tonight. This fits the definition of 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent suicide attempt or a historical experience of a suicide attempt. The phrase ""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"" refers to past *threats/ideation*, not *attempts*. Therefore, 'attempt' is not appropriate.

Based on the presence of explicit suicidal expression, acquired means, and a stated intention to act, the 'behavior' category is the most fitting.

While not using the word ""suicide"", ""im going to do it"" in this context, coupled with expressions of pain and hopelessness, strongly implies ending one's life. ""Im done"" reinforces this.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i cant do this anymore"", ""im in so much pain"", ""i cant handle it anymore"", ""i cant. i cant."" - indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and an inability to cope.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method is mentioned. However, ""im going to do it"" indicates an imminent intention to act. The farewell message (""thank you to the people i met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for."") is a strong sign of preparation for ending life.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i cant do this anymore"", ""im going to do it"", and ""im done"" are direct expressions of wanting to end their current state of being, which implies not wanting to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the farewell message (""thank you to the people i met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for."") is a significant sign of preparation for an imminent act. ""Im going to do it"" indicates a clear intention to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""im going to do it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (implicitly, through ""im going to do it"" and ""im done"" combined with the farewell).
   - It goes beyond mere ideation because ""im going to do it"" indicates an imminent intention to act, and the farewell message suggests preparation for such an act. This constitutes a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - It does not describe a past or recent attempt.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category as it describes explicit suicidal expression with a clear tendency to act and signs of preparation (farewell).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself""
   - Emotional indicators: ""stupid"", ""a lot of stress right now"", ""it would just be a lot easier"", ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life"", ""why not"" (indicating hopelessness, despair, feeling overwhelmed, and a desire for an end to suffering).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is *asking* for a ""mostly painless way to kill myself"", which indicates a search for a method/plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""it would just be a lot easier"", ""why not"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, but the post is a direct inquiry about *how* to commit suicide (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?""). This signifies a clear tendency to identify a plan or method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation, but the active search for a method implies a tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"", ""it would just be a lot easier"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - The user is not just expressing a wish to die (ideation); they are actively seeking information on *how* to die (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?""). This goes beyond mere ideation and indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" by seeking a method.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - The explicit search for a method aligns with the ""behavior"" category's description: ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly mentions ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""die,"" ""end it with pills,"" ""suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators: The post is cautionary and informative, describing the negative physical consequences of overdose. It does not express personal hopelessness or despair from the author.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions ""pills"" and ""overdosing"" as a method, but this is presented as a general scenario to deter, not a personal plan or preparation by the author.
   - References to past attempts: No personal past attempts are mentioned by the author. The post describes general outcomes of overdoses.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""commit suicide,"" ""suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post is a warning *against* suicide by overdose, not an expression of the author's desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills,"" ""overdosing.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not by the person writing the post. The post describes the general consequences of such an act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to the general, unpleasant consequences of a future action (overdosing) if someone were to attempt it. It is a warning, not a personal intention or past event of the author.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, not by the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a method (pills/overdosing).
   - However, the *intent* of the post is to *deter* suicide by overdose, by describing its painful and often non-fatal consequences.
   - The post does not contain any explicit suicidal expression from the author themselves. Instead, it aims to counter or ""resolve"" suicidal thoughts related to overdose by providing factual information about its negative outcomes. This aligns with ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues"" in the sense that it's actively working against suicidal actions.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'indicator' category as it does not express personal suicidal intent, plan, or past attempt, but rather addresses the topic in a preventative manner.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""im positive im gonna do it"", ""no motivation to keep on living""). However, it explicitly states that there is no *current* plan or immediate tendency (""im good rn"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this"" indicating a future, conditional action, not an immediate one).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post expresses extreme distress about being alive (""living a life psychologically tortured"") and regret about being born (""hate my parents for having me""), but no direct mention of ending life.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong negative emotions are present: ""I fucking hate my parents"", ""psychologically tortured"". These indicate severe emotional pain, anger, and feelings of neglect.

   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses profound unhappiness with being alive and the circumstances of their birth, but not a direct wish to die or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings (""I fucking hate"") stemming from past events (""having me"", ""couldn't even find the time to care for me"") leading to a current state of suffering (""living a life psychologically tortured""). There are no future intentions related to self-harm or suicide.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post clearly indicates significant emotional distress, suffering, and regret about their existence. However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, or any plans/attempts*.
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'ideation' requires ""explicit suicidal expression"". This post does not have it.
     - 'behavior' and 'attempt' also require explicit suicidal expression or mention of specific actions/attempts, which are absent.
     - 'indicator' is defined as ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This post fits the ""no explicit suicidal expression"" part, despite the high level of distress. It's a cry of pain and regret about life, but not a direct suicidal statement.

I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post describes a dream involving ""mass murdering people"" by ""foreign men,"" but this violence is external to the user and does not indicate the user's own suicidal intent or self-harm. There are no mentions of the user wanting to die or harm themselves.
   - Emotional indicators: ""severe panic attack,"" ""terrified,"" ""sheer panic,"" ""anxious to sleep,"" ""intense dreams."" These indicate significant distress, fear, and anxiety, but they are directly linked to the vivid dream and its aftermath, not to suicidal thoughts or feelings of hopelessness about life itself.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the user's own self-harm or suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user is expressing fear and anxiety about a dream and seeking advice on how to cope with the anxiety it caused.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the user's own suicide or self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for the user's own suicide or self-harm.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a recent dream and the user's current anxiety resulting from it. It does not refer to past or future suicidal intentions of the user.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post describes a distressing experience (a vivid nightmare) and the resulting anxiety. There is no explicit suicidal expression, no mention of wanting to die, no plans for self-harm or suicide, and no history of attempts. The emotional distress, while significant, is clearly attributed to the dream and not to suicidal ideation. Therefore, it falls under the 'indicator' category as there is no explicit suicidal expression.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""end this suffering"", ""so i can do it"" (implying ending life), ""overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" The ""on purpose"" overdose is a clear self-harm/suicide attempt.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fear and despair"", ""need something to believe in"", ""don't want to believe theres nothing."" These indicate deep distress and a search for meaning to justify a drastic action.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No *new* specific plan or method is mentioned for a *future* action, but past methods (""overdosed twice"") are explicitly stated.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" This is a direct and explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the phrase ""end this suffering"" combined with ""so i can do it"" and the mention of past ""overdosed... on purpose"" strongly implies suicidal intent.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" is a direct expression of wanting to end their current state, which, in context, points to ending life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Past methods (""overdosed twice"") are mentioned. No *new* specific method for a future action is provided, but the desire to ""do it"" is present.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No signs of preparation for a new attempt are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""ive overdosed twice"" refers to past events (attempts). ""what comes after. i just need something to believe in so i can do it. ... please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" refers to current suffering and a desire for a future action to end it.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** Yes, ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""end this suffering,"" ""so i can do it"").
    *   Crucially, it explicitly mentions ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" with ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" The ""on purpose"" part clearly indicates a past suicide attempt.
    *   Comparing the categories:
        *   'indicator': Ruled out due to explicit suicidal expression and past attempts.
        *   'ideation': Ruled out because there is more than just ideation; there's a clear mention of past attempts.
        *   'behavior': This category includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While an overdose can be self-harm, the ""on purpose"" aspect makes it a suicide attempt.
        *   'attempt': This category specifically states ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This perfectly matches ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose.""

    The most precise category for this post, given the explicit mention of past suicide attempts, is 'attempt'.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No suicide methods are mentioned. The methods described are for the alternative coping mechanism (living in squats, begging, etc.).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of suicide preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past feelings (""felt like I couldn't cope"", ""on two of those occasions I hit the road"") and how the alternative *resolved* those feelings. The author states they are ""a functional member of society at the moment"" and the alternative is a ""comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again,"" indicating a resolved past issue and a coping strategy for potential future stress, not current suicidal intent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past suicide *attempts* are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the context of past feelings (""on the brink of suicide""). However, the core message is about an *alternative* coping mechanism that *resolved* those past suicidal feelings (""the road has saved me in the past""). The author states they are currently ""a functional member of society"". There is no current explicit suicidal expression, nor is there any indication of an unresolved suicidal issue. The mention of ""should I ever need it again"" refers to the *alternative* coping mechanism, not a return to suicidal ideation. This aligns with the 'indicator' category, which includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I can't go on anymore,"" ""end it."" These are direct expressions of wanting to cease living.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My life has been getting worse,"" ""so lonely,"" ""I fucked up my life,"" ""I miss outside I miss being happy."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, regret, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it."" This indicates a specific timeframe (""tonight"") and a clear intention to act (""end it""). Being ""drunk in my basement"" could be seen as setting the scene or a means to lower inhibitions, leading to the act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end it"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't go on anymore,"" ""end it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Being ""drunk"" is mentioned, which can be a contributing factor or part of a plan, but a specific physical method (e.g., overdose, specific tool) is not detailed. However, the statement ""tonight... then end it"" clearly indicates a *plan to act* within a specific timeframe.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Being ""drunk in my basement"" and stating the intention for ""tonight"" suggests preparation and a clear intent to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and a clear future intention: ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it."" Past struggles are mentioned as context.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post has explicit suicidal expression (""I can't go on anymore,"" ""end it"").
    *   It clearly indicates a plan and tendency to act: ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it."" This includes a timeframe (""tonight"") and a stated intention to carry out the act. This goes beyond mere ideation.
    *   There is no mention of a *recent* or *historical* suicide *attempt*, only a future intention.
    *   Therefore, it best fits the 'behavior' category, which describes explicit suicidal expression with a plan or tendency to act.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""successfully end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Emotional indicators: The question implies severe distress and a desire to die.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" This indicates possession of specific substances. The question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" directly links these substances to a suicidal act.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""successfully end my life"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the entire post is framed around this desire and the means to achieve it.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user states ""I have"" and ""access to"" these substances, indicating possession or immediate availability of means. The question is about the efficacy of these specific means for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The user is asking about the potential for a future act using currently available means.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""successfully end my life"").
    *   It also clearly indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" because the user possesses specific means (codeine, ibuprofen) and is inquiring about their effectiveness for suicide. This goes beyond mere ideation by including specific means and a direct question about their lethal potential. It is not an attempt, as the act has not occurred, nor is it a past historical experience.

    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""die"" is mentioned.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" is a *reconsideration* or a *hopeful thought* that dying is *not* necessary. It implies a shift *away* from suicidal ideation, rather than an expression of it. The overall tone is one of hope for a better future, even if currently ""not okay"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains the word ""die"" but frames it as ""maybe i don't need to die,"" which is presented as ""a hopeful thought."" This is not an expression of wanting to die, but rather a questioning or rejection of that idea, indicating a potential resolution or movement away from suicidal thoughts.
    *   There are no explicit expressions of wanting to die, no plans, no methods, and no mention of past attempts or self-harm behavior.
    *   The core message is one of hope for improvement and a reconsideration of the need to die, even while acknowledging current struggles. This aligns with the 'indicator' category's description of ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues"" or the absence of explicit suicidal expression.

   - Emotional indicators: ""i just wanna be calm rn because im bored and when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taking 3 xanax pills"" (specific method/substance and quantity), ""i will do it anyway"" (intention to act).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts are always there"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly wanting to die *right now*, but asking about dying from pills and stating ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" indicates a presence of suicidal ideation and a contemplation of death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""3 xanax pills"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The user is asking about the effects of a specific substance they intend to take (""i will do it anyway""), indicating a clear tendency to act out.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The user is contemplating an action (""taking 3 xanax pills"") and stating intent (""i will do it anyway"") in the present/near future. ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" refers to an ongoing state.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts are always there""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and expressing a clear intention/tendency to act (""i will do it anyway""). This moves it beyond 'ideation'.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the user explicitly states ""I can never get the nerve to jump"" and ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""jump"", ""die"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation because the user describes a concrete, recurring *behavior*: physically going to a specific location (ledge of a parking garage) with the intent to jump, and spending time there ""trying to work up the nerve."" This demonstrates a clear ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" as defined in the 'behavior' category.
   - It is not an 'attempt' because the user states they haven't gained the nerve to jump.
   - It is not 'ideation' because it involves physical actions and a clear tendency, not just thoughts.
   - It is not 'indicator' as there is explicit suicidal expression and ongoing high-risk behavior.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states: ""The first time I tried committing suicide"", ""After attempting"", ""I have multiple attempts on my life"", ""my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""struggling with depression"", ""life is going absolutely shitty"", ""hated myself"", ""grades went to shit"", ""mentally exhausting"", ""It gets harder everyday"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** For past attempts, ""using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope"" is mentioned. For current intentions, ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"" indicates an active search for methods.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, ""The first time I tried committing suicide"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life"" are direct references to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""my death seems to ultimate answer"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, for past attempts (phone charger, rope). For current, the user is ""searching about ways to kill myself"". This indicates a current tendency to find a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself"" is a sign of preparation/tendency.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. It describes past suicide attempts (""The first time I tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts on my life"") and current suicidal ideation with a tendency to act (""its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the first attempt with a phone charger is described, and ""multiple attempts"" are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression and describes current suicidal ideation with a tendency to find a method (""searching about ways to kill myself""). This aligns with 'behavior'.
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly states ""The first time I tried committing suicide"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life"". The definition for 'attempt' includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"". This directly matches the content of the post.
    *   Since the post clearly describes historical suicide attempts, the 'attempt' category is the most fitting and specific classification.

201,"Found a new best friend. who was also just faking everything. I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all, i show nothing but respect and kindness to them but they just fake everything, then when i figure it out im just more dead inside then if they just told me to stop in the first place. Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""more dead inside"" (metaphorical for emotional pain), ""done with everything"" (expresses extreme emotional exhaustion and giving up on efforts, not explicitly on life itself).
   - Emotional indicators: ""I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all"", ""im just more dead inside"", ""Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything."" These indicate profound sadness, hopelessness, despair, and a feeling of being unvalued and exhausted.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. ""More dead inside"" is an idiom for emotional numbness/pain, not a literal desire for death. ""Done with everything"" expresses a desire to cease current struggles, not explicitly to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current emotional state and a general feeling of being overwhelmed and exhausted by life's challenges. It does not describe past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being ""done"" with current struggles. However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or plans for self-harm/suicide*. The phrases used are metaphorical for emotional pain and exhaustion rather than direct suicidal ideation. Therefore, it fits the description of 'indicator' as it has no explicit suicidal expression.

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrases ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"" strongly imply self-harm or suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""less scary"", ""getting more courage"" indicate a mental preparation to overcome fear and act.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""jump out of my bedroom window"" is a specific method and location. ""trees and mud below"" indicates an assessment of the landing area. ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" expresses a clear intent and timeline.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the described action (jumping from a window with intent to harm oneself) is an explicit expression of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly, but the intent to jump from a window implies a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""getting more courage"" indicates mental preparation, and ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicates a clear intent to act in the near future. The mention of ""trees and mud below"" suggests a specific location has been identified and assessed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""I think I can jump off"", ""I'm getting more courage"", ""Hopefully I can do it soon"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (implied by the described action and intent).
   - It clearly outlines a specific plan (method: jumping; location: bedroom window, with details about what's below).
   - It shows a strong tendency/intent to act (""getting more courage"", ""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
   - This goes beyond mere ideation, as a concrete plan and intent to act are present. It does not describe a past or recent attempt. Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit as it describes explicit suicidal expression with a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.

There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""writing suicide notes""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""low energy"", ""depression hits really hard"", ""hate talking about myself"", ""waste their time"", ""gonna scream"" (frustration/despair), ""issues""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""writing suicide notes"" (this is a preparatory action, a tendency towards a plan)
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit past attempts mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression of wanting to die, but the act of ""writing suicide notes"" strongly implies suicidal ideation and a tendency towards action.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" is a significant sign of preparation or a tendency towards acting on suicidal thoughts. It's an action taken in relation to suicidal intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" - This describes a recurring pattern or current tendency/behavior when the user is struggling. It's not a past *attempt*, but a recurring *behavior* (writing notes) linked to current struggles.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': Ruled out, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   'ideation': While there is explicit suicidal expression, the act of ""writing suicide notes"" goes beyond mere thoughts. The definition of 'ideation' states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"". Writing notes is a *tendency* or a preparatory *behavior*.
    *   'behavior': The post content has explicit suicidal expression (""writing suicide notes""). The act of ""writing suicide notes"" indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" (as it's a preparatory action) and describes a ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (if writing notes is considered a behavior, which it is, as it's an action taken in response to suicidal thoughts). This fits the 'behavior' category best because it describes an action taken in relation to suicidal thoughts, not just the thoughts themselves.
    *   'attempt': Ruled out, as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt (e.g., ""I tried to overdose,"" ""I cut myself and needed stitches""). Writing notes is not an attempt itself.

    The key differentiator between 'ideation' and 'behavior' here is the phrase ""writing suicide notes."" This is an action, a concrete step taken, indicating a tendency to act out, rather than just having thoughts or expressions of wanting to die without any associated action or plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""hope i die"", ""People dying is funny"", ""fuck me fuck da world"" (implies self-destructive sentiment).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""suffering mentally"", ""all depressed"", ""No one cares"", ""need attention"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""hope i die"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act on these thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation' which is explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""cut to deep"" is a direct mention of self-harm, specifically cutting. The phrase implies the act has occurred and was severe.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Ah."" and ""fuck"" suggest distress, pain, or frustration.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cut"" is a method. ""to deep"" indicates the severity of the cut.
    *   References to past attempts: The phrase ""Just cut"" implies a very recent or ongoing action, not necessarily a past *attempt* in the sense of a failed suicide, but a past *behavior* of self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. However, there is a direct expression of self-harm.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly, but the statement describes the act itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Just cut"" indicates a very recent past event or an ongoing action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': This category is for no explicit suicidal expression or resolved issues. This post clearly describes self-harm.
    *   'ideation': This category is for explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide. This post describes an *action* of self-harm, not just an idea.
    *   'behavior': This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" is a direct description of self-harm *behavior*. While it doesn't explicitly state suicidal intent, the act of ""cutting to deep"" is a severe form of self-harm, which falls under this category's inclusion of ""self-harm behaviour.""
    *   'attempt': This category requires ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The post describes cutting, which is self-harm, but does not explicitly state it was a ""suicide attempt."" The focus is on the act of cutting itself, not the explicit intent to end life, although the severity (""to deep"") is concerning. Given the options, 'behavior' is a better fit as it specifically covers self-harm actions.

The post describes a recent act of self-harm (""Just cut to deep""), which directly aligns with the ""self-harm behaviour"" part of the 'behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post directly references comments like ""don't do it!"" which are explicit interventions against suicide. The poster's response, ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice,"" explicitly links their current ""feeling"" to the suicidal context implied by the ""don't do it!"" comments. While not a direct statement of ""I want to die,"" it is an explicit acknowledgment that they are experiencing the feelings that prompt such warnings.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme anger, frustration, despair, feeling misunderstood, resentment towards perceived unhelpful interventions.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, indirectly by the poster, but explicitly through the context of reacting to ""don't do it!"" comments and acknowledging ""what I'm feeling"" is the subject of those comments. This constitutes an explicit acknowledgment of suicidal feelings.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Refers to current feelings and reactions to ongoing interventions.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:** The post contains explicit suicidal expression because the user explicitly acknowledges that ""what I'm feeling"" is the suicidal urge that others are trying to prevent (""don't do it!""). This is a clear, unambiguous communication of being in a suicidal state, even if phrased as a reaction to others. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act, nor any historical behavior or attempt. Therefore, it fits the 'ideation' category.

However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The phrase ""but dont at the same time"" indicates ambivalence, but the suicidal ideation is clearly present.

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts"", ""thinking about partially planning to die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods are detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""partially planning to die"" indicates a nascent plan or a tendency towards planning. The statement ""I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst"" suggests a recognized risk of acting without a fully formed plan, which points to a *tendency to act*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and ongoing (""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now"", ""they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months"", ""every single day I feel terrible"", ""I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts"", ""want to justify dying""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by stating ""thinking about partially planning to die"" and acknowledging a risk of impulsive action (""I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst""). This indicates a *tendency to act* or a nascent plan, which is a key differentiator from 'ideation'.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The phrases ""partially planning to die"" and the concern about being ""impulsive and sporadic"" align directly with having a ""tendency to act out... suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category due to the explicit suicidal expression combined with the mention of ""partially planning"" and the recognized ""tendency to act"" impulsively.

    *   **References to past attempts:** ""ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears."" This indicates past suicidal thoughts/desires, but not a past *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""better off dead"", ""end it"", ""hang myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""better off dead"", ""no reason to keep going"", ""then i can rest in peace"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot"". This describes a specific location and a sequence of actions leading to the method, indicating a concrete plan and tendency to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""i've been thinking i could just drive out... and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This refers to current thoughts and future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, past *thoughts* of ending it were mentioned, but not past *attempts*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""better off dead"", ""hang myself""). It also describes a specific plan and method (""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself""), which indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" While past suicidal thoughts are mentioned, there is no description of a past or recent *attempt*. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'behavior'.

   - Emotional indicators: ""i wish i wasn't like this :("" (distress, self-dislike).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions ""putting eye drops in his beverages"" as an ""idea of a new suicide method"". This is an idea for a method, not a concrete plan or preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts"", ""new suicide method"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct ""I want to die"", but the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and the struggle to suppress them implies a desire not to be in this state.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""putting eye drops in his beverages"" is mentioned as an *idea* for a ""new suicide method"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation. It's presented as an idea that arose from watching a video.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current ""suicidal thoughts"" and a newly acquired ""idea"" for a method. The phrase ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that"" indicates a current struggle and a desire *not* to act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts"", ""new suicide method""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - It mentions a specific method (""eye drops in beverages"") but frames it as an ""idea"" and explicitly states ""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that"". This indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts and method ideas, but a lack of *tendency* or *plan* to act on them. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""wrote a suicide note"", ""primed and ready to be posted on social media"", ""Planned everything out"", ""Picked a time and place"".
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a past event where a detailed plan was made and a suicide note was written, but the act itself was ""sabotaged"" (not carried out). This is a historical experience of *preparatory behavior* for suicide, not a completed or interrupted attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide note"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by ""free myself of my problems"" and the concluding statement ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific physical method, but a detailed *plan* is described: ""wrote a suicide note"", ""primed and ready to be posted"", ""Planned everything out"", ""Picked a time and place"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, writing the note, having it ready to post, planning time and place.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""A month ago I wrote a suicide note... Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself.""). Crucially, it *also* expresses current feelings and future intentions: ""I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"". This indicates a *current tendency* and *future intent* to act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **'indicator'**: No, there is explicit suicidal expression and it is not resolved.
    *   **'ideation'**: No, because there is clear mention of a detailed past plan and a current *tendency* and *future intention* to act, which goes beyond mere ideation without a plan or tendency.
    *   **'behavior'**: This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   Explicit suicidal expression: Yes.
        *   Plan or tendency to act out suicide: Yes, the past detailed planning (""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place."") constitutes a plan. The current desire to ""coax the feeling back out"" and the statement ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" clearly indicate a *current tendency* and *future intention* to act on such a plan.
        *   Mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour: The detailed planning and writing of a suicide note, even if sabotaged, are preparatory *behaviors* leading up to a potential suicide, fitting this part of the definition.
    *   **'attempt'**: No, the post explicitly states ""Then sabotaged myself"", meaning the act was not carried out. It is not a recent or historical completed/interrupted suicide attempt.

    The combination of explicit suicidal expression, detailed past planning, and a current strong tendency/future intention to act fits the 'behavior' category best.

I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" (implies wishing to not exist). ""I am hanging on by threads"" (metaphor for being at the brink of giving up).
   - Emotional indicators: ""suffering,"" ""don't feel it will ever end,"" ""utter hell,"" ""alone and forgotten,"" ""stain upon the world,"" ""crying,"" ""forsaken,"" ""pain,"" ""tension,"" ""rotten pit,"" ""outcast,"" ""fading memory,"" ""endless pain."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, loneliness, and emotional distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" is a strong indirect expression of wishing to not exist or be dead. ""I am hanging on by threads"" suggests being at the very edge of coping.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current intense suffering and feelings of hopelessness about the future. The statement ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" refers to a current feeling about their potential non-existence. The last sentence, ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain,"" indicates a current struggle to find reasons to live, implying they are *not* actively planning to end their life, but are experiencing severe ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wishing to not exist (""if I were gone"") and severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and being at the brink (""hanging on by threads""). This constitutes explicit suicidal expression.
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or clear tendency to act on these feelings. In fact, the concluding sentence ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present"" suggests an active effort to cope and find reasons to live, despite the pain.

Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post directly quotes and reacts to the phrase ""If you are actually suicidal and not been attention seeking you would've told no one and just ended it silently so nobody could stop you"". The user also states, ""They won't believe it until I die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Intense anger, rage, frustration, feeling misunderstood, neglected, and dismissed (""FUCK OFF. I FUCKING HATE IT"", ""PLAIN STUPID"", ""SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE"", ""Sorry for the rage""). The user expresses a struggle to ""hold on"" and a need for ""help.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used, and the concept of ""ended it silently"" and ""until I die"" is discussed.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The user is reacting to a statement about suicide and expresses frustration that their feelings aren't believed ""until I die."" However, the core message is ""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP."" This indicates a struggle with suicidal thoughts but also a desire to *not* act on them and to receive help.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and past experiences of seeking help and being dismissed. The phrase ""until I die"" refers to a potential future outcome, but the immediate context is the current struggle and need for help. The user is ""trying to hold on.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal,"" ""until I die"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method for suicide.
    *   There is no indication of a current tendency to act out self-harm or suicide; in fact, the user explicitly states they are ""trying to fucking hold on"" and ""still need help,"" which suggests a desire to *avoid* acting on suicidal thoughts and to seek support.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wanna kill myself"", ""killing myself"", ""suicide notes"", ""if I do it"", ""my death"", ""shoot myself on the spot"".
   - Emotional indicators: Defiance, anger, hopelessness, desire for revenge (""ruin their lives"", ""I don't care"", ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"", ""burden of my death"", ""I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""suicide notes I threw away"" (past preparation/behavior), ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" (expressed desire for a method, but not a concrete plan).
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of a past *attempt*, but the writing of ""suicide notes"" is a past *preparatory behavior* related to suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""wanna kill myself"", ""killing myself"", ""suicide notes"", ""if I do it"", ""my death"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""wanna kill myself"", ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"", ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""shoot myself on the spot"" (expressed desire for a method, but not a concrete plan).
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""suicide notes I threw away in the trash"" indicates past preparation. This is a significant behavioral component.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current strong suicidal ideation (""wanna kill myself"", ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"", ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"") and past preparatory behavior (""suicide notes I threw away""). The desire for family to live with the burden of death is a future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, but past *preparatory behavior* (writing suicide notes) is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly has explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because it mentions a past concrete action related to suicide: ""suicide notes I threw away"". Writing suicide notes is a form of preparatory behavior for suicide, fitting the ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" part of the 'behavior' definition (as preparation for suicide is a self-harm behavior).
   - There is no mention of a completed or attempted act of suicide, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The combination of explicit suicidal expression, a strong current tendency/impulse (""wish I could shoot myself on the spot""), and past preparatory behavior (""suicide notes"") aligns best with the 'behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""The end is the only thing that feels right now."" This strongly implies an end to life, likely self-inflicted.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness (""I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up.""), despair, guilt (""Sorry I wasn't a better person""), and a sense of finality.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method is mentioned. However, the post reads like a farewell message or a suicide note (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you to those who brought any light into my life. Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson. I'm sorry I wasn't a better person.""). These farewells are a strong sign of preparation and a tendency to act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" combined with the farewells is a very strong, direct expression of wanting life to end.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, the extensive farewells to loved ones and apologies (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt..."", ""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson"", ""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person"") are characteristic signs of preparation for an imminent act, akin to a suicide note. This indicates a *tendency to act out*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** This refers to current/future intentions. The tone is one of immediate finality and farewell, implying an imminent act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (implied by ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" and the farewells).
    *   While no specific *method* is stated, the comprehensive farewells and apologies strongly indicate a *tendency to act out* and are a form of preparation for suicide. This goes beyond mere ideation and suggests an active move towards an act.
    *   It does not mention a past or recent attempt.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'behavior' which includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""Quote about suicide"" and includes the phrase ""if you want to kill yourself"" as part of the quote being discussed.
   - Emotional indicators: The user is asking for information about a quote, not expressing personal emotions or distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, within the context of a quote the user is inquiring about.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user is quoting someone else's thought and asking for more information about the quote, not expressing their own desire to die or not be alive. The explicit mention of suicide is attributed to the quote, not the user's personal state.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a quote the user ""recently stumbled upon"" and is an inquiry for more information about that quote. It does not refer to the user's past, current, or future suicidal intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill yourself,"" but these are part of a *quote* that the user is asking about.
   - The crucial rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" In this case, the user is not expressing their own suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt. They are merely discussing a quote that contains these themes.
   - Since the user's *own* expression does not indicate suicidal intent, a plan, or a past attempt, and is merely an inquiry about a quote, it falls under the category where there is ""no explicit suicidal expression"" from the person writing the post.

    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, nor signs of preparation. This means it's not 'behavior' based on a *plan*.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   The key distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' is the ""tendency to commit suicide"" or ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The phrases ""i've accepted that and now i'm ready to join my dog"" and ""i can't do this anymore"" strongly convey a sense of readiness and a *tendency to act* on the suicidal thoughts, moving beyond mere contemplation. While a method isn't specified, the expressed readiness indicates a higher level of risk than pure ideation.

229,"My grandpa passed away tonight. I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit. Now, I know I can't do that. My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy.

However, the statement ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts"" strongly implies that the ""awful thoughts"" are related to self-harm or suicide, making it an implicit, yet clear, expression of suicidal ideation. The need to clarify ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"" suggests the *idea* of hurting oneself is present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and ongoing struggles (""I can't take it anymore,"" ""I'm so tired,"" ""I've been drowning in these awful thoughts"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear expressions of severe distress and implicitly, but strongly, indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts (""drowning in these awful thoughts"" combined with the clarification ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"").
    *   Crucially, it explicitly states ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself,"" which means there is no plan or tendency to act out.
    *   This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" While not using the word ""suicide,"" the context of ""awful thoughts"" and ""hurt myself"" clearly points to suicidal ideation. It is not 'indicator' because there is clear, albeit implicit, suicidal expression that is not resolved. It is not 'behavior' or 'attempt' because there is no plan, tendency to act, or mention of past self-harm/attempts.

241,"I'm so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive. Yesterday my mom woke me up after work and I was having a dream and after I woke up I felt so fucking angry. I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme self-loathing (""I fucking hate myself"", ""pathetic""), hopelessness (""I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice""), despair, anxiety (""worrying about wasting time"", ""always worried about it""), social isolation, physical discomfort (trouble swallowing), crying.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific, actionable plan for suicide is mentioned. The thoughts of self-harm are explicitly stated as *imagined* and *never acted upon* (""I've never purposely hurt myself""). The desires for external events to cause death (roof collapse, mattress eating) are not self-initiated plans.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression"". This is hospitalization for depression, not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt. The post explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every fucking day"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I fucking hate being alive"", ""I want to die"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for *suicide*. Imagined self-harm is mentioned, but explicitly stated as not acted upon.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings and desires (""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every fucking day""). Past hospitalization for depression is mentioned. Past self-harm thoughts are mentioned, but explicitly stated as never acted upon.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Hospitalization was for depression, and the user explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear and explicit expressions of wanting to die and thinking about dying daily. This fits the ""explicit suicidal expression"" criterion.
    *   However, there is no mention of a concrete plan, method, or tendency to act on these suicidal thoughts. The self-harm thoughts are explicitly stated as being *imagined* and *never acted upon*. There is no historical experience of self-harm *behavior* or suicide *attempt* described.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" (direct expression of wanting to die).
   - Emotional indicators: ""hurting"", ""hurt so bad emotionally"", ""so depressed"", ""everything is so exhausting"", ""my own body is giving up"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific active plan or method (e.g., ""I will take pills,"" ""I will jump""). The desire is to ""die in my sleep,"" which is a passive wish rather than an active plan. No preparations mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No active method is mentioned. ""Die in my sleep"" is a desired outcome, not a method the person intends to enact.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention (""tonight"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"").
   - However, there is no explicit plan or tendency to *commit* suicide (e.g., a specific action the person will take). The wish is passive (""die in my sleep"").
   - This fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
   - It does not fit 'behavior' because there is no active plan or tendency to act out self-harm/suicide.
   - It does not fit 'attempt' as no attempt is mentioned.
   - It does not fit 'indicator' as there is explicit suicidal expression.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wasn't enough to kill me"" explicitly states the intent was to die.
   - Emotional indicators: The post is factual about a past action and its current physical effects, and a question about safety.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Zoloft overdose"", ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"" describes a specific method and quantity used.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, the entire post describes a past action (""at 11:30 I took..."") that was intended to be lethal (""wasn't enough to kill me"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""wasn't enough to kill me"" directly refers to a failed suicide attempt.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The past action implies this intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Zoloft overdose"", ""6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Taking the pills is the act itself.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This clearly refers to a past event (""at 11:30 I took..."") that occurred recently. The question about going to the hospital relates to the consequences of that past event.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a Zoloft overdose with the stated intent to die.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes an action taken with the intent to die (""wasn't enough to kill me""). This fits the definition of a suicide attempt. The temporal context indicates it was a recent event.
   - 'indicator' is incorrect as there is explicit suicidal expression and action.
   - 'ideation' is incorrect as an action was taken, not just thoughts or expressions without a plan/tendency to act.
   - 'behavior' is incorrect because while it describes self-harm behavior, the explicit intent to die (""wasn't enough to kill me"") elevates it to an 'attempt' based on the category definitions. The 'attempt' category specifically covers ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This post fits the ""recent suicide attempt"" part.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrases ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""At peace knowing it's soon"", ""Hope my plan works though"", and ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"" all strongly imply an intention to end life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""calm about it"", ""At peace knowing it's soon"" suggest a sense of finality and resolution, which can be a concerning sign. Underlying distress is also mentioned (""chronic stress"", ""hellish trauma"", ""severe chronic fatigue syndrome"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Hope my plan works though"" explicitly states the existence of a plan, although no specific method or tool is detailed. ""At peace knowing it's soon"" indicates a temporal proximity to the intended action.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the intent to end life is very clearly and explicitly expressed through phrases like ""destined to do it"", ""made my decision"", ""it's soon"", and ""no way I'm living"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up."" and the overall context.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the statement ""I've made my decision and I feel so calm about it. At peace knowing it's soon. Hope my plan works though"" strongly indicates that a decision has been made, a plan exists, and the action is anticipated to be soon.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current and future intentions (""destined to do it"", ""it's soon"", ""Hope my plan works"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (implied but clear intent to end life).
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by explicitly stating the existence of a ""plan"" (""Hope my plan works though"") and indicating a ""tendency to act out"" due to the sense of finality and imminence (""made my decision"", ""it's soon"", ""destined to do it"").

    *   Emotional indicators: ""Hopeless,"" ""felt hopeless for months,"" ""realizing you're hopeless is too much.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method or plan is mentioned for *committing* suicide. However, the desire to ""find an actual suicide forum"" indicates an active step towards engaging with the topic of suicide, potentially for information or community related to suicidal actions.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide forum.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression of wanting to die, but the strong feelings of hopelessness combined with seeking a ""suicide forum"" clearly imply suicidal thoughts and a desire to engage with the topic.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No direct preparation for an attempt, but actively seeking a ""suicide forum"" can be interpreted as a preparatory step or a ""tendency to act out"" by seeking resources related to suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings (""I've felt hopeless for months"") and a current/future intention (""I just want to find an actual suicide forum"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** This category is for no explicit suicidal expression or resolved issues. The post clearly has explicit suicidal expression (""suicide forum"").
    *   **ideation:** This category is for explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide. While there's no explicit *plan* for *how* to commit suicide, the active desire to ""find an actual suicide forum"" goes beyond mere passive ideation. It suggests a proactive step towards engaging with the topic.
    *   **behavior:** This category is for explicit suicidal expression with a plan or *tendency to act out* self-harm or suicide, or historical self-harm. The desire to ""find an actual suicide forum"" indicates a ""tendency to act out"" by actively seeking resources or community related to suicide. This is an active step, not just a thought, and implies a movement towards potential action or engagement with suicidal means/discussions.
    *   **attempt:** This category is for recent or historical suicide attempts. There is no mention of an attempt.

    Based on the analysis, the active desire to ""find an actual suicide forum"" moves this beyond simple ideation. It represents a ""tendency to act out"" by seeking specific resources related to suicide, which aligns with the 'behavior' category.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""what's really the point?"" expresses a loss of purpose or meaning, which is a strong indicator of distress and potential risk, but it is not a direct statement of wanting to die or not be alive.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip."" While not a direct statement of wanting to die, it expresses a profound despair that freedom from pain (which is often associated with death in such contexts) will never come. The inability to die is presented as a curse, implying death would be a release.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming hopelessness (""never understands,"" ""never understand,"" ""never die,"" ""never be free,"" ""pain will never loosen its grip""), despair (""live in pain,"" ""suffer,"" ""alien""), feeling misunderstood, profound suffering, a sense of being trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, not directly as ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Not directly. However, the statement ""I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip"" strongly implies a desire for freedom from pain, which is unattainable because death (the perceived release) will not come. This is a nuanced, but strong, expression of a desire for an end to suffering that points towards an end of existence. The *concept* of death as a release is present, and the despair stems from its perceived unattainability.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is saturated with extreme hopelessness and a profound sense of unending pain. The phrase ""I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip"" indicates that the individual sees death as the only potential release from their suffering, but believes it is unattainable. This lament about the inability to die and be free from pain, while not a direct ""I want to die,"" is a strong implicit expression of suicidal ideation. It conveys a desire for an end to their current painful existence. There is no plan or tendency to act, nor any mention of past self-harm or attempts. Therefore, it fits the 'ideation' category.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions the sister ""willingly and voluntarily ended her life"" (suicide) and ""had made attempts in the past."" The author also states, ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" indicating a desire for death. Crucially, the author states, ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" The author also contemplates ""why bother going through all of it?"" and finds ""the idea of that state lasting forever [sleep/death] is one that is hard to turn away from.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Pain, doubt, questioning the point of life, feeling that death would be a ""welcome end,"" not wanting to feel the current way, apathy about the future, looking forward to sleep as an escape.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations for a *current* suicide are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, the author explicitly states, ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times, both in reference to the sister and the author's own past.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" ""why bother going through all of it?"", and ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. The sister's suicide and the author's past attempt are historical. However, the author expresses *current* suicidal ideation (""like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" ""But now I find myself in a different place,"" ""why bother going through all of it?"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""welcome end to everything,"" ""why bother going through all of it?""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post *also* explicitly mentions a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" (""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"").
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression but *no plan or tendency* and *no mentioned historical experience*. This post has historical experience.
        *   'behavior' requires explicit suicidal expression and a plan/tendency *OR* mentioned historical experience of *self-harm behaviour*. While a suicide attempt is self-harm, the 'attempt' category is more specific.
        *   'attempt' explicitly states: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, *or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*.""

    Since the post directly mentions a ""historical experience of suicide attempt,"" the most precise and appropriate classification is 'attempt'. The presence of current ideation combined with a past attempt places it in the highest risk category defined by the provided rules.

   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, or any plans/methods.
   - According to the definitions, 'indicator' applies when ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression"". This post fits that criterion as it expresses general distress and a need for support, which can be an indicator of underlying issues, but not direct suicidal ideation or behavior.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" It also describes self-harm behaviors: ""I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants... secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, loneliness, trauma, neglect, rejection, and physical/mental suffering are evident throughout the post (""sick of being epileptic,"" ""melancholic mind,"" ""crippling depressives reaction,"" ""suffocated me with my evil thoughts,"" ""absolute failure,"" ""failed miserably,"" ""miserably unfair,"" ""infuriating"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details a specific method of self-harm: ""addiction to use paracetamols"" and ""starve my self,"" which has already resulted in physical damage (""It damaged my liver my digestive system""). While not a *plan for suicide*, it is a description of *self-harm behavior* that is presented as part of the reasons for wanting to ""end it.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** The description of paracetamol addiction and starvation leading to liver and digestive system damage, and the ongoing nature of these behaviors, constitutes ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" It's not explicitly stated as a past *suicide attempt* (where the intent was to die), but rather as self-destructive behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and ""wanting to end it.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wanting to end it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""addiction to use paracetamols"" and ""starve my self,"" which have caused physical damage. This describes a *tendency to act out self-harm*.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The description is of ongoing/past self-harm behaviors rather than preparation for a future suicide attempt.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past traumatic events that have led to current suicidal ideation (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."") and describes past/ongoing self-harm behaviors (""It damaged my liver my digestive system"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The post describes past *self-harm behavior* (paracetamol abuse, starvation) that has caused physical harm, fitting the ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" criterion.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."", ""wanting to end it."").
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing specific self-harm behaviors (""addiction to use paracetamols,"" ""starve my self"") that have already resulted in physical damage (""It damaged my liver my digestive system""). This clearly indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm"" and describes ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
    *   It does not describe a specific, recent, or historical *suicide attempt* (an action with the primary intent to die), but rather ongoing or past self-destructive actions. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going out of this world"", ""I'm offing myself then"", ""Goodbye world"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm not worth living"" indicates hopelessness and low self-worth.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A very specific date and time are given (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours""), linked to the user's birth time, indicating a clear timeline and intention to act. The phrase ""offing myself"" indicates the method (suicide).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm offing myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going out of this world"", ""I'm not worth living"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The method is suicide (""offing myself""). Crucially, a very specific date and time are provided (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours""), which constitutes a concrete plan for *when* the action will occur.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the precise date and time, linked to a significant personal event (birth), strongly suggest a deliberate plan and preparation of a timeline for the act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a clear future intention: ""I'm going out... I'm offing myself *then*.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm offing myself"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by providing a specific date and time for the intended action (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours. ... I'm offing myself then.""). This constitutes a clear ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - It does not describe a recent or historical suicide attempt, nor does it describe historical self-harm *behavior*, but the future-oriented plan is strong enough to classify it as 'behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" strongly implies the user's absence, likely through death. ""I have to make it stop"" in the context of ""can't do this anymore, all the upset and pain and hurt I cause"" suggests ending their own life/existence to stop the perceived pain and harm they cause.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""can't do this anymore,"" ""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause"" (hopelessness, despair, self-blame, burden).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.

The phrase ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it"" indicates a *desire* to have acted, but explicitly states a *barrier* (fear of failure/consequences) that prevented action, not a past attempt.

While past events are mentioned as context for the current feelings, the suicidal thoughts themselves are present and ongoing.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No. The statement ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it"" indicates a hypothetical past action that was *not* taken due to fear, not an actual past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, nor any signs of preparation, which rules out 'behavior'. The fear of ""botching it"" acts as a deterrent, indicating a lack of immediate tendency to act out.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparation for the act itself, but the question ""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends"" suggests a serious contemplation of the act's execution and its impact, indicating a ""tendency to act out"" rather than just ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I need to kill myself"").

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""By this time next week I'll be gone"").
    *   It does not mention a past suicide attempt.
    *   The key distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.

        *   'behavior' implies explicit suicidal expression and *there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide*.
    *   While a specific method is not mentioned, the statement ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" provides a definite timeframe and a clear declaration of intent to end one's life. This moves beyond mere passive thoughts or wishes (ideation) and indicates a strong *tendency to act out* or a nascent plan, even without a specified method. The definite future statement implies a decision has been made and action is intended.

I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I went in with the intention of dying.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly by name (e.g., ""pills,"" ""knife""), but the actions described (""testing my method,"" ""went until shortly before the point of no return,"" ""went in with the intention of dying"") clearly indicate a method was identified, prepared, and initiated to a significant degree.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of ""testing my method"" and initiating it with the ""intention of dying"" implies preparation and execution of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past events: ""in my life,"" ""past year or two,"" ""Both of these happened long enough ago.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, two distinct events are described, with the second one clearly detailing an action taken with the intent to die, which was then stopped. This fits the definition of an interrupted suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression and detailed descriptions of historical actions taken with suicidal intent.
    *   The second event described (""I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself"") directly aligns with the definition of an interrupted suicide attempt.
    *   The 'attempt' category description includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The user is clearly discussing and describing historical experiences that they are questioning as suicide attempts, and at least one of them fits the criteria.

270,"Why exactly should I even have hope anymore? Its evident from my entire life up until now that I was never meant to be happy. I have to learn to not get my hopes up or get excited over shit. Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I really want to die"" and ""Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone."" It also expresses a wish to ""kill off my emotions.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong feelings of hopelessness (""never meant to be happy,"" ""nothing ever gets better,"" ""never achieve my goals""), despair, anger, self-blame (""I am the one ruining my own life,"" ""I probably deserve to suffer""), profound distrust of others (friends, family, romantic partners), and a sense of being trapped and worthless.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The phrases ""I really want to die"" and ""I'd rather die than submit to anyone"" are direct expressions.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The desire to die is expressed as a current feeling and intention (""I really want to die"").

   - There is no indication of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - There is no mention of past self-harm behavior or suicide attempts.
   - Based on the definitions, this aligns with 'ideation' which states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" It does not meet the criteria for 'behavior' (no plan/tendency to act out, no historical self-harm) or 'attempt' (no mention of recent or historical attempts). It is clearly more than an 'indicator' as it contains explicit suicidal expression.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I hurt myself two months ago"" (self-harm), ""my forearms with my wounds are visible"" (evidence of past self-harm), ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" (desire for death).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""nothing happened,"" ""couldn't hide my pain,"" ""tired all the time,"" ""sleeping is really hard,"" ""tired of putting a mask on."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, isolation, and emotional exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan or method for *suicide* is mentioned. The past self-harm method (cutting forearms) is implied.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I hurt myself two months ago"" refers to a past act of self-harm. It does not explicitly state it was a *suicide attempt* (i.e., with lethal intent).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" is a direct expression of desiring death as an escape.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** For *suicide*, no. For *self-harm*, yes (implied cutting on forearms).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No signs of preparation for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""I hurt myself two months ago"" refers to a past event. ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" refers to a current feeling and a desired future state.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** A past *self-harm* event is described (""I hurt myself two months ago""), but it is not explicitly stated as a *suicide attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post also mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""I hurt myself two months ago"" and ""my forearms with my wounds are visible"").
    *   The 'ideation' category states ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" While there's no *suicide* plan, the presence of *past self-harm* is a key differentiator.
    *   The 'behavior' category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*."" This perfectly matches the post's content: explicit suicidal expression (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"") combined with mentioned historical self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"").
    *   The 'attempt' category requires ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The post describes self-harm, not explicitly a suicide attempt. The distinction between self-harm and suicide attempt is important in these definitions.

Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification due to the combination of current suicidal ideation and past self-harm behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The words ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" are used multiple times.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not a direct ""I want to die,"" but the repeated mention of ""suicidal"" thoughts and ""seriously consider it"" implies a strong preoccupation with ending one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned in the post.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the statement ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" is a clear sign of preparation/planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **'indicator'**: Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **'ideation'**: Ruled out. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the definition for 'ideation' states ""there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This post explicitly mentions ""I write detailed plans in my journal,"" which contradicts ""no plan.""
    *   **'behavior'**: This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   Explicit suicidal expression: Yes.
        *   Plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide: Yes, the existence of ""detailed plans in my journal"" directly fits the ""plan"" criterion. The phrase ""actually seriously consider it only once a week or so"" also indicates a tendency to consider acting on these plans, despite the stated reservation about going to hell.
        *   Mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour: No explicit mention of past *behavior*, but the current *planning* is sufficient for this category.
    *   **'attempt'**: Ruled out because there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the explicit mention of ""detailed plans"" for suicide, the post falls into the 'behavior' category.

    *   The post clearly conveys intense emotional pain and a feeling of being unable to cope.
    *   However, it does *not* contain any explicit suicidal expression (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself""). The phrases ""I can't take it anymore"" and ""The pain is unreal"" indicate severe distress but are not direct suicidal statements.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or past attempt.
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   'ideation' requires *explicit* suicidal expression, which is absent here.

        *   'indicator' states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This post fits the ""no explicit suicidal expression"" part, despite the high level of distress. It's a strong sign that the person is struggling, but not explicitly stating suicidal thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""commiting suicide"" is explicitly present.
   - Emotional indicators: The tone is somewhat dark and ironic, linking the capability to commit suicide sober to ""Higher Power in action,"" which is a twisted interpretation of AA principles.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""don't kill yourself"", ""how to accomplish death"", ""my father died"", ""Mark Linkous overdosing"", ""A failed suicide"", ""my body is continuously accompanied by death"", ""nowhere close to dying"", ""End it now"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""in hell"", ""so alone"", ""painful feeling of inability to connect"", ""sadder"", ""terribly scared"", ""depression"", ""physical pain"", ""high anxiety"", ""never ending pain"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user explicitly discusses methods: ""I don't want my head to explode via shotgun"", ""for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth"", ""I've looked into other options"". This indicates active research and consideration of specific means.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions Mark Linkous's overdose and failed suicide, but this is a reference to someone else's experience, not the poster's own.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""don't kill yourself"", ""how to accomplish death"", ""A failed suicide"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"", ""End it now"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. Shotgun, handguns (with specific details like caliber and entry point), and ""other options"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The detailed discussion of methods and the statement ""I've looked into other options"" indicate active research and consideration of *how* to commit suicide, which constitutes a ""tendency to act out"" or a concrete ""plan"" in terms of method selection.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"", ""End it now""). The reference to Mark Linkous is a past event, but it informs the poster's current fears and considerations regarding future actions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, not by the poster themselves.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by discussing specific methods in detail (""shotgun"", ""handguns"", ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth"", ""looked into other options"") and expressing fear about *how* to accomplish death and the consequences of *failed* attempts. This detailed consideration of means and the active research (""I've looked into other options"") clearly indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt by the person writing the post, only a reference to someone else's failed attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits the 'behavior' category due to the explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear discussion and consideration of specific methods/plans.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;.

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive.

My job and parents abuse me too. I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""so tired of this empty loneliness I feel,"" ""My job and parents abuse me too."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned. No signs of preparation are described. However, ""Only a matter of when"" indicates a firm decision and intention to act, suggesting a strong tendency.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts or self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned, but the phrase ""Only a matter of when"" signifies a resolved intention to act, indicating a strong tendency rather than just a fleeting thought.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/future intentions (""I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm going to kill myself.""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   The phrase ""I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when."" goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts of suicide without a plan or tendency). It expresses a clear decision and a strong *tendency to act out* suicide, even without a specific method or immediate timeline. The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". This fits the post's content, as the user has a clear tendency/intention to act.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.

    Therefore, the post best fits the 'behavior' category due to the explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear tendency/intention to act (""Only a matter of when"").

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Death is an option"", ""suicidal thought"", ""die"".
   - Emotional indicators: The tone is contemplative and questioning, rather than overtly distressed, but it reveals a passive acceptance of death as a potential outcome (""It's not the worst outcome"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post explicitly states ""I won't commit"" and refers to an ""accident"" rather than a planned action.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thought"" is directly mentioned. The concept of ""Death is an option"" is also a form of explicit suicidal expression.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not a direct ""I want to die,"" but ""Death is an option"" and ""It's not the worst outcome"" for accidental death indicates a passive acceptance or lack of aversion to death, which falls under explicit suicidal expression.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post refers to an ""accident.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current contemplation and questioning of thoughts. ""Death is an option"" is a present thought. ""I won't commit"" refers to future non-action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thought"", ""Death is an option""). This rules out 'indicator' as there is no mention of resolved issues.
   - However, the post explicitly states ""I won't commit"" and refers to an accidental death, not a planned one. There is no plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. This rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""kill me"", ""last chance I have to finally kill me"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I wish i didnt have to do this"" (despair, resignation).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""Tonight is the last chance"", ""Its been a year since i planned this"", ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"". This indicates a specific time frame, long-term planning, and concrete preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past *attempts*, but mentions a year of *planning*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""kill me"").
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes (""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Not explicitly, but ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"" strongly implies a method is ready and acquired.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""Its been a year since i planned this"" and ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything"". ""Tonight is the last chance"" indicates an imminent timeframe.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current/future intentions (""Tonight is the last chance"", ""finally kill me"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No, but past *planning* is (""Its been a year since i planned this"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill me""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by clearly stating a specific timeframe (""Tonight""), long-term planning (""Its been a year since i planned this""), and concrete preparation (""I even have the stuff prepared and everything""). This indicates a strong ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   It does not describe a past or recent *attempt*, but rather an imminent intention with preparation. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category as it describes explicit suicidal expression with a plan or tendency to act out.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""stave myself"", ""my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Idk"", ""I hate my body"", ""I see no reason to fuel it with energy"" (hopelessness, self-loathing, despair).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I've decided to stop eating all together and stave myself"" (a clear method and decision to act).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I've decided to stop eating"", ""I hope my body breaks down slowly"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"", ""stave myself"", ""this just ends"").
   - It clearly outlines a specific plan/method (""stop eating all together and stave myself"").
   - It expresses a clear intention and decision to act on this plan (""I've decided to stop eating all together"").
   - This fits the 'behavior' category as it has explicit suicidal expression and a plan/tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. The initial statement about being ""too much of a pussy to kill myself"" is immediately followed by a concrete, alternative method of self-destruction that the person has decided upon, indicating a shift from one perceived inability to a decided course of action.

293,"Here's the deal. I'm not ok. I haven't been ok for a very long time. Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch. In my past I've had everything that made me who I am stripped away from my character time and time again. It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive. But for now, in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness I've come to befriend over the last few months, but I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is present, implying that sometimes the thought of being gone exists, but it's immediately qualified by ""not always"" and not a direct expression of current desire.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness."" These indicate significant emotional distress, despair, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: No. The post mentions past difficult life experiences but not past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expressions. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is the closest, but it's a qualified statement, not a direct, current desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past difficult experiences and current emotional distress. There are no current or future suicidal intentions expressed.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post conveys significant emotional pain, loneliness, and a feeling of not being okay.
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or a direct, current desire to die. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is a fleeting thought acknowledged, but it's not a direct expression of suicidal intent and is mitigated by the overall tone which includes acknowledging the preciousness of life (""I know how precious that is"") and a desire for connection (""I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️"").
   - There are no plans, methods, or historical attempts mentioned.
   - Based on the definitions:
     - 'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression, which is not present here.
     - 'behavior' and 'attempt' require explicit suicidal expression plus plans/actions or past attempts, which are also not present.
     - 'indicator' states ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This post fits the ""no explicit suicidal expression"" part, despite the high level of distress. The closest statement (""I don't always wish to be gone"") is not a direct, current expression of suicidal intent.

Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i wanted to die when i made that post"". The phrase ""i just don't want to die"" indicates a struggle against these thoughts, but the presence of the past desire to die and current hopelessness confirms explicit suicidal expression.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past feeling (""i wanted to die when i made that post"") and a current state of profound hopelessness (""I have no hope"", ""I don't know what to do""). The struggle is current, and the suicidal thoughts are present, even if there's a part that ""doesn't want to die.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""i wanted to die when i made that post"", ""I have no hope"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act on these thoughts. The post describes a struggle with these feelings and a failed attempt to reach out for help, leading to more despair.
    *   There is no mention of self-harm *behavior* or suicide *attempt*, only the experience of suicidal *thoughts*.
    *   Therefore, the category 'ideation' fits best as it describes explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide.

301,The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it. My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of. I could do it right now.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself"", ""fear of death"", ""scared to die"", ""emptiness after death"", ""hope that I don't wake up"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I hate it"", ""scared"", ""cry myself to sleep"", ""neverending cycle"", ""I'm done"" (indicating hopelessness, despair, exhaustion).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method is detailed by the user. However, the statement ""My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of"" implies that means were a concern and have been removed. The user then states, ""I could do it right now,"" which suggests an immediate capability or strong impulse, even if specific means are not currently available or detailed.
   - References to past attempts: None explicitly mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""hope that I don't wake up"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., ""pills"", ""gun"") is mentioned by the user.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of parents having ""taken any means they can think of"" suggests a history of concern about the user's access to means, implying a perceived risk of action. The user's statement ""I could do it right now"" indicates a present impulse or perceived capability to act, which aligns with a ""tendency to act out.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions and ongoing struggle (""The only thing preventing me..."", ""I could do it right now"", ""hope that I don't wake up"", ""It's a neverending cycle"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing myself"", ""hope that I don't wake up""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on ""plan or tendency to commit suicide"". While no detailed *plan* is given, the phrase ""I could do it right now"" strongly indicates a present *tendency* or *impulse* to act, despite the fear of death. The context of parents removing ""any means they can think of"" further supports the idea that there is a perceived risk of the user acting on these thoughts. This goes beyond mere ideation and suggests a strong inclination or capability to act, fitting the ""tendency to act out"" criterion for 'behavior'.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""set a date"", ""my letters were written"", ""had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes coming ""extraordinarily close"" to an attempt with a plan and preparations, but explicitly states ""I keep living past that date"" and ""I'm still here,"" indicating the plan was not executed. This refers to past *behavior* (planning, preparation) that did not culminate in a completed attempt.
    *   **Current state:** ""I'm still here and I made the decision to live. Life will be challenging going forward, but I'll make it work. Now my situation is no longer as desperate as it once was. The light at the end of the tunnel is almost here."" These phrases indicate a current state of resolution and overcoming past suicidal ideation/behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""killing myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post explicitly states a decision to live and a resolved situation. It describes past intent, not current.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""set a date"", ""my letters were written"", ""had a set plan"". While no specific *tool* is mentioned, the level of preparation (letters, set plan, set date) is very detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""my letters were written"" and ""had a set plan.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The detailed suicidal thoughts and plans are explicitly described as *past* events (""came extraordinarily close"", ""was days away from going through with"", ""posted here so many times about how I set a date and then… I keep living past that date""). The *current* intention is to live and overcome challenges (""I made the decision to live"", ""I'm still here"", ""my situation is no longer as desperate"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, it describes coming ""extraordinarily close"" to an attempt with a plan and preparations, but not a completed attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression about the past (""came extraordinarily close to killing myself"").
    *   It describes past *behavior* (planning, preparing, nearing execution) that fits ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" from the 'behavior' category.
    *   However, the dominant and explicit message of the post is one of *resolved suicidal issues*: ""I'm still here and I made the decision to live,"" ""my situation is no longer as desperate,"" ""The light at the end of the tunnel is almost here.""
    *   The 'indicator' category explicitly includes posts that ""has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" While past behavior is mentioned, it is presented as something overcome, leading to the current state of resolution. Given that the classification is for ""suicide risk categories"" and the post clearly indicates a *resolved* state and a decision to live, the current risk is low. The primary message is one of overcoming. Therefore, 'indicator' is the most appropriate classification as it reflects the current state of resolved risk.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. There is no indication of a current plan or intent to act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post explicitly states ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it"". This indicates a *regret about not having acted* on suicidal thoughts in the past, rather than a description of a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

There is no mention of a current or future intention to act.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No. The post describes *not* attempting (""not doing it years ago"", ""wish that I had just done it the first time""), expressing regret for *not* having died.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear and explicit suicidal expression (""wished I wasn't alive"", ""wanted things to be over"", ""wish that I had just done it"").
    *   There is no mention of a current plan or tendency to commit suicide. The regret is about *not* having acted in the past.
    *   It does not describe a past suicide attempt or self-harm behavior; rather, it describes *not* having acted on suicidal thoughts.
    *   Therefore, the content aligns best with ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do?

She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""end my own life,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""suicide."" It also mentions ""I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone,"" which indicates past self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""anger issues,"" ""affected the relationships,"" ""caused hurt,"" ""emotional pain,"" ""numbers dwindle,"" ""cry for help.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past suicide *attempts* are mentioned. However, past *self-harm* is mentioned (""caused damage to my own [body] when I was alone"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""end my own life,"" ""killing myself,"" ""suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the user is actively contemplating ending their life based on a ""utilitarian"" logic and is struggling to find reasons not to.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The primary suicidal ideation refers to current contemplation and future intentions (""utilitarian for me to end my own life,"" ""emotional pain that I will cause future people""). Past self-harm is also mentioned (""I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past self-harm.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression and no plan, the post *also* mentions historical experience of self-harm. This moves it beyond pure ideation according to the definitions.
    *   **behavior:** This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*."" The post clearly has explicit suicidal expression (""end my own life,"" ""killing myself""). While there is no *current* plan or tendency to act out suicide, the user *does* mention ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" with the phrase ""I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone."" This directly matches the second part of the 'behavior' definition.
    *   **attempt:** Incorrect. There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*. The self-harm mentioned is not described as an attempt to end life.

    Based on the explicit mention of past self-harm (""caused damage to my own [body] when I was alone"") in conjunction with explicit suicidal expression, the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate fit.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""a gun"") and actively questioning the lack of ""good option for us to end it all."" This demonstrates a clear *tendency to act out* or at least a strong desire to find a means to do so, even if the preferred method is unavailable.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""dislike it"", ""disappointed in myself"", ""feel like shit"", ""hate it"", ""disgusted"", ""hateful I felt towards myself"", ""Terrible feeling"". These indicate significant distress, self-loathing, and hopelessness.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""wanting to kill myself""), which rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method for suicide, nor any historical suicide attempt, which rules out 'attempt' and the 'plan' aspect of 'behavior'.
    *   However, the post describes an *action* taken in direct relation to the suicidal thoughts: ""I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself"". While not a direct act of self-harm or a suicide attempt, this is a behavioral manifestation of the intense distress and suicidal ideation. The 'behavior' category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". This specific action, though not physically harmful, is an acting out of the psychological distress and suicidal thoughts, indicating a ""tendency to act out"" in a way that goes beyond mere passive ideation. It's a coping mechanism directly tied to the suicidal thoughts, making it a behavioral component.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times. Phrases like ""die prematurely,"" ""end my life,"" ""kill themselves,"" and ""wanting to end my life"" are present.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author expresses a strong conviction that suicide is a ""solution"" and a ""means of escape."" There's frustration with societal views (""disdain and disgust,"" ""no support,"" ""lies""). The tone is resolute and defiant regarding their personal stance on ending their life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).

    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.

        *   'ideation' is defined as: ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
        *   'behavior' is defined as: ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
    *   The post does not mention a specific plan. However, the statement ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it"" is a strong declaration of personal resolve and future intent. This goes beyond mere passive thoughts or wishes. It indicates a firm decision and a ""tendency to act out"" on that decision, even if the specific method or timeline is not detailed. The certainty expressed (""absolutely,"" ""no doubt about it"") suggests a more active state of intent than what is typically associated with 'ideation' (which explicitly states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide""). Therefore, the strong, resolved intention to end their life, even without a concrete plan, aligns with the ""tendency to act out"" aspect of the 'behavior' category.

We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""self harm"" multiple times (""I've had issues with self harm in the past,"" ""cutting for attention,"" ""used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain,"" ""Btw theres about a dozen scars""). It also contains the phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore,"" which is an expression of questioning the value of life. The mention of ""encouraging K to kill herself"" refers to another person (K), and per the rules, this is not relevant for the poster's risk assessment.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired,"" ""in pain,"" ""numb and empty inside,"" ""cried myself to sleep,"" ""wonder if it's even worth it anymore."" These indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific future plans or methods for suicide or self-harm are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a specific past incident of self-harm: ""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."" This is described as an act to ""relieve some of the pain,"" which is characteristic of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) rather than a suicide attempt. It also mentions ""I've had issues with self harm in the past"" and ""about a dozen scars,"" confirming historical self-harm behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not directly as an intent for the poster.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is an explicit expression of questioning life's value, which falls under suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? For past actions, ""cutting"" is implied and ""scars"" are mentioned. For future intent, no methods are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes significant past self-harm behavior (""I've had issues with self harm in the past,"" the incident ""a few months ago,"" ""a dozen scars""). It also expresses a current feeling/questioning of life's worth (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? A specific past self-harm *behavior* is described, but it is framed as pain relief, not explicitly as a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains ""explicit suicidal expression"" (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"").
    *   The post also clearly ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (the incident a few months ago, general past issues with self-harm, and the presence of scars).
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   'indicator' is incorrect as there is explicit suicidal expression and self-harm.
        *   'ideation' is incorrect because while there is explicit suicidal expression, the post *also* describes historical self-harm behavior, which moves it beyond just ideation.
        *   'behavior' states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*."" This perfectly matches the post's content.
        *   'attempt' is incorrect because the described past incident is framed as self-harm for pain relief, not explicitly as a suicide attempt.

    Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts."" The user states, ""I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change."" This indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressive spell,"" ""spiraling worse,"" ""fucking nightmare,"" ""long wait in depression time scales,"" ""worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms."" These show significant distress and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. The user is actively seeking ways *not* to act on the thoughts (considering hospital, asking for ideas).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past suicide attempts are mentioned. The user mentions dealing with bipolar symptoms for 7 years and being prone to psychotic symptoms (visual hallucinations, delusions), but not past *suicide attempts* or *self-harm behaviors*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a desire to *avoid* acting on these thoughts by going to the hospital.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The user is contemplating seeking professional help as a preventative measure.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a current struggle with suicidal ideation and a future intention to seek help (hospital) once insurance is active. The user acknowledges a potential future change in their state (""that can change"" regarding being a danger to self) but does not describe a current plan.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains ""explicit suicidal expression"" (""suicidal ideation,"" ""suicidal thoughts""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" In fact, the user is actively trying to prevent acting on these thoughts by considering hospitalization and asking for advice. This rules out 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a ""recent suicide attempt"" or ""historical experience of suicide attempt."" This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   The post perfectly fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" The user is experiencing the thoughts but is not expressing a plan or immediate intent to act on them, rather seeking alternatives.

Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I hope I die soon."", ""Soon I will be finally dead."" The user also mentions ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily,"" which is a self-harming and potentially lethal behavior.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I hope I die soon""), despair, anger (""Fuck that"", ""Fuck them!"", ""They will pay for how they made me feel!"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No explicit suicide *plan* (e.g., specific method, time, location). However, the daily heroin use is a current, active, self-destructive *behavior* that could lead to death, and it's mentioned in conjunction with the desire to die. The impending forced institutionalization is a significant stressor.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit past suicide attempts. There is a past negative experience with antipsychotics.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I hope I die soon."", ""Soon I will be finally dead.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not for suicide directly. However, daily heroin use is mentioned, which is a dangerous and self-harming behavior that can be lethal. This ongoing behavior, combined with the explicit desire for death, suggests a tendency to act out self-harm that could result in death.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current desire (""I hope I die soon""), current behavior (""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily""), and future intention/prediction (""Soon I will be finally dead"", ""Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go""). The antipsychotic experience is past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post goes beyond mere thoughts. The user is actively engaging in a dangerous, self-harming behavior (daily heroin use) that is linked to their desire to die.
    *   **behavior:** This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   Explicit suicidal expression: Yes (""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead"").
        *   Plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide: Yes. The daily heroin use is a clear instance of self-harming behavior. This behavior, coupled with the expressed desire for death and the extreme distress over impending forced treatment, indicates a strong ""tendency to act out self-harm"" that could lead to death.
        *   Mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour: While not *historical* suicide attempts, the *current* daily heroin use is a self-harm behavior. The category includes ""tendency to act out self-harm,"" which fits.
    *   **attempt:** No recent or historical suicide attempts are mentioned.

    The presence of active, dangerous self-harming behavior (daily heroin use) explicitly linked to the desire to die moves this beyond 'ideation' into 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""hitting the brain stem"" in the context of not caring about life implies a clear intent to die by suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses a complete lack of care for common reasons to live (""family will miss you,"" ""so much to live for""), indicating deep despair and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user explicitly asks ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem,"" which is a direct inquiry about the optimal method and execution for a fatal self-harm act using a specific tool (gun). This indicates a clear tendency towards planning.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the intent is unequivocally clear through the combination of ""hitting the brain stem"" and the rejection of life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the entire post conveys a strong desire to end life and a complete disregard for reasons to live.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""gun"" and ""hitting the brain stem"" are very specific details about a method and its target.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Asking for the ""best position"" indicates seeking practical information for the execution of the act, which is a sign of preparation or a strong tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current/future intentions, as the user is asking for information to potentially act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (implied through ""hitting the brain stem"" and rejection of life).
   - Crucially, it goes beyond mere ideation by asking for specific, actionable information about a method (""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem""). This demonstrates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" It's not just thinking about suicide; it's seeking practical guidance on how to carry it out.
   - There is no mention of a past or recent attempt.

Therefore, the category 'behavior' is the most appropriate fit.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thought about killing myself"", ""my self harm scars"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""everything just keeps getting worse"", ""nothing to be upset over and i'm dramatic"" (implies feelings of invalidation, despair, worsening situation).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for future suicide.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""thought about killing myself"", ""it wont leave my head"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head. everything just keeps getting worse"" refers to ongoing, current suicidal ideation. ""my mum saw my self harm scars"" refers to past self-harm behavior.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, past self-harm is described, not a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""thought about killing myself"").
   - It also explicitly mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""my self harm scars"").
   - The definition for 'behavior' states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*."" This perfectly matches the content.
   - It is not 'ideation' because the historical self-harm moves it beyond just thoughts.
   - It is not 'attempt' because it describes self-harm, not a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing myself"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method, nor any past attempts.
   - However, the phrase ""Let's just do it"" indicates a strong inclination or ""tendency to act out"" on the suicidal thoughts, even without a defined plan. This goes beyond mere ideation where there is no such tendency.
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'ideation' states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"". This post shows a tendency.
     - 'behavior' states ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The ""Let's just do it"" fits the ""tendency to act out"" criterion.

When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner?

Since the post explicitly mentions historical suicide attempts, it directly fits this definition. While it also contains elements of 'behavior' (current plan), the explicit mention of past *attempts* makes 'attempt' the most precise and severe classification according to the provided definitions.

I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am.

    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing myself"", ""this life for me isn't it""), so it's not 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*, so it's not 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is explicit suicidal expression *without* a plan or tendency to commit suicide.
        *   'Behavior' is explicit suicidal expression *with* a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I'm planning on killing myself at 30 or 25."" This is a clear statement of a *plan*, even if it's conditional and for the distant future. The presence of a stated plan, even a future one, moves it beyond mere ideation (thoughts) into the realm of 'behavior' as defined by ""plan or tendency to act out"".

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""suicide rate"" is mentioned, but it's a general observation about a demographic, not a personal suicidal expression.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" indicates significant distress, feeling vulnerable, or being close to a breaking point. ""perceived as male and a threat,"" ""eyed with suspicion"" indicate feelings of marginalization and negative perception.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide rate"" is mentioned, but it refers to a general statistic for a demographic, not a personal statement of suicidal intent or desire.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. ""teetering on the edge"" suggests distress but is not a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" refers to a current/recent emotional state. The discussion about suicide rates is a general observation. There are no personal future intentions of suicide expressed.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress and feelings of marginalization (""teetering on the edge lately,"" ""perceived as male and a threat"").
   - While ""suicide rate"" is mentioned, it is in the context of a general societal observation and empathy for others, not as a personal expression of suicidal ideation or intent.
   - There is no explicit statement from the author about wanting to die, having suicidal thoughts, or plans for self-harm/suicide.
   - The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" indicates a state of vulnerability or crisis, but it does not explicitly state suicidal ideation.
   - Based on the definitions, 'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression, which is absent for the author. 'behavior' and 'attempt' require plans/tendencies or past attempts, which are also absent.
   - The post content has no explicit suicidal expression from the person writing it. Therefore, it best fits the 'indicator' category.

330,My mom told me suicide is a coward way to go out. Thanks mom. Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours. Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :(.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide is a coward way to go out"", ""if I'm gone within 24 hours"".
   - Emotional indicators: Sarcasm (""Thanks mom""), despair/sadness ("":(""), empathy for others struggling.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific timeframe (""within 24 hours"") is given for the user to be ""gone,"" which implies a plan to act. The phrase ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling"" sounds like a farewell message. No specific *method* (e.g., tool, location) is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., how they will be ""gone"") is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the specific timeframe (""within 24 hours"") and the farewell message (""Peace out all..."") strongly suggest a concrete intention and a timeframe for action, which constitutes a plan or tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicide"", ""gone within 24 hours"").
   - It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because it includes a specific, short timeframe (""within 24 hours"") and a farewell message, indicating a clear intention and tendency to act out. This constitutes a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" as per the 'behavior' category definition, even without a specific method being named. It's not an 'attempt' as it describes a future intention, not a past or recent action. It's not 'indicator' as there is explicit suicidal expression that is not resolved.

331,"Abused as a child. I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I don't have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""it's killing me"" is present, but it is an idiom for extreme emotional distress, not a literal statement of suicidal intent or a desire to die by suicide. There are no other mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.

   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or a desire to die. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is an idiom for extreme emotional pain, not a literal suicidal statement.
   - There are no plans, methods, or preparations for suicide or self-harm.
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.
   - Based on the definitions, the post content has no explicit suicidal expression. While the distress is severe and could be a precursor to suicidal thoughts, the post itself does not contain them explicitly. Therefore, it fits the 'indicator' category.

What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""self harm"", ""harming"", ""bloodying myself up now"", ""kill myself"", ""suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, relapse (""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend. ... Now after four months I'm self harming again.""), urgency (""I should do it now and save time."").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific *suicide* method (e.g., specific tool, location) is mentioned. However, ""bloodying myself up now"" indicates *current self-harm behavior*. The phrase ""It's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."" indicates a strong *tendency* and *intent* to act on suicidal thoughts.
   - References to past attempts: The post explicitly mentions ""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend"" and ""Now after four months I'm self harming again,"" which describes a historical and current pattern of *self-harm behavior*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"", ""suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""It's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *suicide* method. However, ""bloodying myself up now"" describes a current *self-harm* action.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation for suicide, but the statement ""I should do it now and save time"" indicates a strong, immediate tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
     - Past: ""I've been four months without self harm"", ""It started with an old trigger"".
     - Current: ""until this weekend"", ""I'm self harming again"", ""I'm bloodying myself up now"".
     - Future/Intent: ""It's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."" This clearly expresses future suicidal intent and a strong tendency to act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The post describes past and current *self-harm behavior*, not explicitly past *suicide attempts*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression and current self-harm.
   - 'ideation': Incorrect, because while there is explicit suicidal expression, there is also current self-harm behavior and a clear ""tendency to commit suicide"" (""It's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."").
   - 'behavior': This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
     - Explicit suicidal expression: Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide"").
     - Plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide: Yes, ""I'm bloodying myself up now"" (current self-harm) and ""It's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."" (strong tendency/intent for suicide).
     - Mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour: Yes, ""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend. ... Now after four months I'm self harming again.""
     This category perfectly aligns with all elements of the post.
   - 'attempt': Incorrect. The post describes self-harm behavior and suicidal ideation with a strong tendency to act, but it does not explicitly state a *suicide attempt* (e.g., ""I tried to overdose,"" ""I survived an attempt""). The self-harm is described as distinct from a suicide attempt in the context of the definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""someone blow my head off"", ""im fucking done"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me"". The phrase ""before i hurt someone"" could imply self-harm or harm to others, but the context of ""please kill me"" suggests the primary focus is on their own death to prevent potential harm.
   - Emotional indicators: ""im fucking done"", ""tired if these stupidass ignorant people"". Shows extreme despair, exhaustion, and anger.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""blow my head off"" implies a method (gunshot), but it's phrased as a request for *someone else* to do it. ""please kill me"" is also a request to others. There are no signs of personal preparation or intent to carry out the action themselves.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""someone blow my head off"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""blow my head off"" implies a method, but it's presented as a request for someone else to perform the action, not a personal plan. ""please kill me"" is also a request.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""someone blow my head off"", ""please kill me"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""someone blow my head off"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me"").
   - However, there is no *personal* plan or clear tendency for the individual to *act out* self-harm or suicide. The methods mentioned are framed as requests for others to intervene, not as actions the poster intends to take themselves. There are no signs of preparation.
   - It does not describe a past or recent attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'ideation' category, as there is explicit suicidal expression but no personal plan or clear tendency to commit suicide.

I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Coward"", ""up against a wall"", ""heart is too tired and fragile"", ""pain I feel now"", ""panic and jump away and start crying"". Strong indicators of despair, hopelessness, and self-loathing.

""I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks."" ""How do I stay on the tracks?"" This indicates a specific method (train) and knowledge of the means (schedule, proximity). The repeated mention of ""jump away at the last minute"" implies a repeated *tendency* to act on the plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" ""Yet the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute."" This clearly describes past suicide attempts, even if aborted at the last minute.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks."" The repeated action of going to the tracks and almost acting (""times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute"") indicates a strong tendency to act on the plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both past events (""the first time I actually attempted"", ""the times I have tried"") and current/future intentions (""I know the way I will end it"", ""wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak"", ""How do I stay on the tracks?"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" and ""Yet the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, a specific plan with knowledge of means, and a strong current tendency to act on that plan (repeatedly going to the tracks and struggling to follow through). These elements align with the 'behavior' category.
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly states: ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" The 'attempt' category definition includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This direct mention of a past suicide attempt places the post squarely in the 'attempt' category. While elements of 'behavior' are present (plan, tendency to act), the explicit mention of a past *attempt* is the defining factor for the 'attempt' category according to the provided rules.

339,People tell me I'm a burden. I'm 23. I haven't left the house since I was 14. I don't have a job. I still live at home. I lay in bed all day.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""People tell me I'm a burden."" This indicates feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, and potentially despair or hopelessness. The description of not leaving the house for years, no job, living at home, and laying in bed all day points to severe social isolation, lack of engagement, and symptoms consistent with depression.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current situation and ongoing state (""I'm 23. I haven't left... since I was 14. I don't have a job. I still live at home. I lay in bed all day."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a state of significant distress, social isolation, and feelings of being a burden, which are strong risk factors for suicidal ideation. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal intent. It does not describe a plan, behavior, or attempt.
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'indicator': ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This fits because there is no explicit suicidal expression.
     - 'ideation': Requires explicit suicidal expression. Not present.
     - 'behavior': Requires explicit suicidal expression and a plan/tendency or historical self-harm. Not present.
     - 'attempt': Requires explicit expression of a recent or historical suicide attempt. Not present.
   - Therefore, the post falls into the 'indicator' category as it highlights risk factors and distress without explicit suicidal content.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there. I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life tbh",2,behavior,"<thinking>

    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. The mention of ""I tried going to the school"" refers to seeking help, not a suicide attempt.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""stick some knives through my stomach.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night"" indicates a conditional plan with a specific timeline/event.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The suicidal expressions and plans are clearly current and future-oriented (""I can kill myself on graduation night,"" ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach""). Past events are mentioned as contributing factors to the current state.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by including a specific plan (""kill myself on graduation night"") and a specific method (""stick some knives through my stomach""). This indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*, which would classify it as 'attempt'.

    Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category as it includes explicit suicidal expression and a plan/tendency to act.

   - It goes beyond mere ideation because it describes specific methods (""knife to my wrist"") and repeated preparatory actions (""had a knife to my wrist 3x""). This demonstrates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - The phrase ""each time I couldn't cut"" means a completed attempt did not occur. Therefore, it does not fit the 'attempt' category, which requires ""recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
   - The 'behavior' category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" This perfectly matches the post's content: explicit suicidal expression, a mentioned method/plan, and a clear tendency to act out self-harm (repeatedly holding a knife to the wrist).

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes past feelings and thoughts (""During lockdown here in Denmark, we had a long winter."", ""I was very depressed..."", ""At some point my thoughts came to..."", ""It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal."").
   - Crucially, the post states: ""Never really thought I would act it out."" and concludes with a message of hope and advice for others: ""Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful... For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now."" This indicates that the suicidal thoughts were a past experience and are now resolved for the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression from the past.
   - However, the key is that the author explicitly states they ""Never really thought I would act it out"" and then transitions into a message of hope and advice, indicating that these suicidal issues are now resolved for them.
   - According to the definition, 'indicator' includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This perfectly matches the content, where the author reflects on past suicidal thoughts but is now in a place of resolution and offering help to others.
   - It is not 'ideation' because the suicidal expression is presented as a past, overcome state, not a current one.
   - It is not 'behavior' or 'attempt' as there is no mention of plans, tendencies to act, or actual attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end myself again tonight"", ""end it tonight again"", ""trying to overdose"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""really depressed and sad atm"", ""idk what to do"", ""crying basically all night and now this morning"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""try to end myself again tonight"", ""Probably by trying to overdose"".
    *   References to past attempts: The word ""again"" in ""end myself again tonight"" and ""end it tonight again"" strongly indicates a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end myself"", ""end it"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""end myself"", ""end it"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement indicates a current intention to act tonight.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/future intentions (""tonight"") and explicitly references a past event (""again"" implying a past attempt).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, implied by ""again"" in the context of ""end myself"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""end myself"", ""end it"").
    *   It mentions a specific plan/method (""overdose"") and a timeframe (""tonight""), which would typically point towards 'behavior'.
    *   However, the crucial element is the repeated use of ""again"" (""end myself again tonight"", ""end it tonight again""). This directly indicates a *historical experience of suicide attempt*.
    *   According to the definitions, the 'attempt' category includes posts that ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"". This fits the post perfectly. While there is a current plan, the explicit mention of a past attempt takes precedence for classification into the 'attempt' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""when a cat knows they're dying and they go into some dark corner to die,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" and ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all."" These are clear expressions of a desire for death and a belief in its impending arrival. The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the intent is clear.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""can't fight anymore,"" ""can't try anymore,"" ""so tired,"" ""life and its pain,"" ""tortured soul."" These indicate profound hopelessness, exhaustion, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present. The ""dark corner to die"" is a metaphor for withdrawal, not a specific plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" and ""My death will release my pain"" are direct expressions of wanting to die.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and a belief that death is imminent (""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" ""My death will release my pain""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The key distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'. 'Behavior' requires ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While the post expresses a strong desire to die and a timeframe (""in the next month or two""), it lacks any concrete plan, method, or specific ""tendency to act out"" (e.g., acquiring means, specific location, detailed steps). The ""dark corner"" is a metaphor for withdrawal, not a plan of action.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This fits perfectly. The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire for death, but without outlining *how* it will happen or showing concrete steps towards an action.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"", which indicates a strong preoccupation with *how* to commit suicide. While no *specific* method is named, and no *preparation* is mentioned, the frequency and intensity of this contemplation are significant.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrase ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"" and ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" strongly imply a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method is named.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No signs of preparation are mentioned. However, the constant contemplation of methods suggests a strong mental engagement with the *means* of suicide.

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** This category is for explicit suicidal expression *without* a plan or tendency to commit suicide. While the post doesn't state a concrete plan, the phrase ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" goes beyond passive suicidal thoughts. It indicates an intense and frequent mental engagement with the *mechanics* of suicide.
    *   **behavior:** This category requires explicit suicidal expression *and* a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The constant and frequent contemplation of methods (""over 100 times a day"") suggests a strong *tendency to act out* by actively engaging with the means of suicide, even if a specific plan isn't articulated. This level of preoccupation with *how* to die indicates a significant progression beyond mere ideation and points towards a strong inclination or drive towards action. It's not just thinking about dying; it's actively and frequently thinking about *how* to make it happen.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    The intensity and frequency of ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" are key. This is not just a fleeting thought about a method; it's a pervasive and active mental process of considering *how* to commit suicide. This level of active engagement with methods constitutes a ""tendency to act out"" by moving towards forming a plan or taking action.

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child!

They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of self-hatred (""I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much""), regret (""Im so regretful and sorry""), hopelessness (""I dont see any future ahead for me""), and fear (""I am so scared"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" This directly refers to a past experience with suicide that led to hospitalization, which is a strong indicator of a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I will be joining her as well,"" ""my passing"") and a clear statement of current hopelessness (""I dont see any future ahead for me""). This goes beyond 'ideation' which states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide,"" as the statement about joining her mother implies a strong tendency or intention.
   - The most critical element for classification is the historical information: ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" Being ""hospitalised for suicide"" strongly indicates a past suicide attempt.
   - Comparing 'behavior' and 'attempt' categories:
     - 'behavior' includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
     - 'attempt' includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
   - Since the post specifically mentions hospitalization *for suicide*, it directly aligns with the ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" criterion of the 'attempt' category. While the current expression shows a tendency (which could fit 'behavior'), the explicit mention of a past suicide attempt takes precedence and places it in the 'attempt' category.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"". However, phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" strongly imply a desire to end their life or suffering.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nothing, nothing changes"", ""Nothing makes it go away"", ""I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head""), despair (""My mind is hell"", ""tired of living""), pain (""painful""), feeling stupid/weak.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. No signs of preparation (notes, acquiring means).
   - References to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" are strong indirect expressions of wanting to end their life or suffering. The phrase ""stop it"" in context refers to stopping the mental pain/existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a current, ongoing mental battle and expresses a future intention/urgency (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (indirectly, through phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"").
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned.
   - However, the phrase ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" indicates a strong sense of urgency and a ""tendency to act out"" or a feeling of being close to taking action, even without a defined plan. This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts without a tendency to act) and aligns with the ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" part of the 'behavior' definition.
   - It does not mention any historical self-harm or suicide attempts, nor does it describe a recent attempt.

Therefore, the post fits the 'behavior' category due to the explicit suicidal expression and the clear indication of a tendency or urgency to act, even without a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I wanna go sleep forever"" (euphemism for death), ""can't take this shit no more"", ""sick and tired of my shitty life"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, exhaustion (""can't take this shit no more"", ""sick and tired of my shitty life"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have 58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"" - this is a specific quantity of medication, indicating a potential method and means.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wanna go sleep forever"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I wanna go sleep forever"").
   - It clearly identifies a specific method (overdose of named medications) and indicates possession of the means (""I have 58 pcs..."").
   - This combination of explicit suicidal expression and a specific, available method constitutes a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - It does not describe a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.
   - It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because a specific method and means are identified and stated as being possessed.
   - It is not 'indicator' as there is explicit suicidal expression and a clear plan/tendency.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" This is a clear sign of preparation for a suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current distress (""It's too hard"", ""I'm tired"") and a recent decision and action (""I decided this is it"", ""I left a note""). This indicates current/imminent intention and preparation.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""my reason to die"", ""I decided this is it"").
    *   Crucially, it mentions a concrete act of preparation: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" This goes beyond mere ideation and indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
    *   It does not describe a completed or historical suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category as it covers explicit suicidal expression coupled with a plan or tendency to act, evidenced by the preparation of a note.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore. What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight? I just want to be normal. How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
     - ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since."" (Past ideation, ongoing thought)
     - ""fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period."" (Past suicidal expression)
     - ""I just. Want. To die."" (Explicit current desire to die)
     - ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" (Explicit question about method/plan, seeking information on how to commit suicide)
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, loneliness, feeling like a burden, frustration.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post asks ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"". This is not a fully formed plan, but it is an active inquiry about a method, indicating a tendency to act out by seeking means.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. There is mention of past suicidal ideation and expression.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""screamed that I wanted to die"", ""fired for being suicidal"", ""I just. Want. To die."", ""How do I kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just. Want. To die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is stated as a plan, but the user is actively asking ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"". This is a direct inquiry into a method, indicating a search for means or a tendency to act.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). However, the question about *how* to commit suicide suggests active consideration of the practicalities, which is a step towards preparation or a strong tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
     - Past: ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die"", ""fired for being suicidal"".
     - Current/Future: ""It's never been far away from my mind since"", ""I can't keep doing this anymore"", ""I just. Want. To die."", ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"". The current desire to die and the active question about *how* to do it indicate current and potential future intent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No. Past ideation and expression are described, but not past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
Based on the analysis:
- The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I just. Want. To die.""). This rules out 'indicator'.
- There is no mention of a past or recent suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
- The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' is crucial. 'Ideation' implies explicit suicidal expression *without* a plan or tendency to commit suicide. 'Behavior' implies explicit suicidal expression *with* a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.
- The phrase ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" is not just a passive thought or wish. It is an active question seeking information about a method, and it includes a specific desired outcome (no body). This demonstrates a clear ""tendency to act out... suicide"" by actively exploring the means to do so. This goes beyond mere ideation and indicates a higher level of risk.

Therefore, the post fits the 'behavior' category due to the explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear tendency to act out by actively seeking information on how to commit suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""No point in it all,"" ""push me over the edge,"" ""wasn't meant for this world,"" ""what the point of moving on is,"" ""don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" These are strong indicators of suicidal ideation and a desire to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""No point in it all,"" ""won't get anywhere in life,"" ""don't really see a future""), despair (""hate being trapped in limbo,"" ""view of the world is growing more and more dim,"" ""everything here is lame and it just makes me sick""), self-blame/worthlessness (""people are starting to lose hope in me (as they should),"" ""keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., ""I will jump,"" ""I will take pills"") is mentioned. No explicit preparations are mentioned. However, the phrases ""I need something to really push me over the edge"" and ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" indicate a strong *tendency to act* and a readiness to initiate suicide, rather than just contemplating it. The user is actively seeking an impetus to end their life and explicitly states they won't wait for a natural end.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the intent to die and end life is explicitly and repeatedly expressed through phrases like ""push me over the edge,"" ""wasn't meant for this world,"" ""no point of moving on,"" ""don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, very clearly.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation. However, the language (""One last push is all I need,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"") indicates a strong *tendency to act* and a readiness to move towards suicide, implying a proximity to action even without a detailed plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily expresses current feelings and strong future intentions (""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""I won't get anywhere,"" ""I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post goes beyond mere contemplation. Phrases like ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""One last push is all I need,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" indicate a strong *tendency to act* and a readiness to initiate suicide, rather than just passive thoughts. This moves it beyond simple ideation.
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void""). Crucially, it also demonstrates a clear ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through the phrases ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""One last push is all I need,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" This indicates an active desire for an immediate end and a readiness to take action, even if a specific method isn't detailed. The user is actively seeking the impetus to commit suicide.
    *   **attempt:** Incorrect. There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the strong expression of suicidal intent combined with a clear and present ""tendency to act"" (seeking a ""push,"" not wanting to wait), the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate classification.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""commit suicide"", ""get to that place"" (referring to suicide), ""snap and break down"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""painful emotions"", ""bottled everything up"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses the general reasons why people might commit suicide (""People who commit suicide are not weak... we've bottled everything up""), rather than expressing the author's personal desire to die or not be alive. The ""we"" appears to be a general reference to humanity or people in general, not a direct personal statement of current suicidal intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a general understanding of the psychological process leading to suicide (""Most of the time people get to that place because...""). It's a commentary on the phenomenon, not a personal statement of current or future intent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post discusses suicide as a general topic, offering an empathetic perspective on why people might reach that point.
   - It does not contain any explicit *personal* suicidal expression from the author (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm thinking of suicide""). The mention of ""suicide"" is in the context of discussing others or a general human experience, not the author's own current state.
   - There is no plan, method, or indication of preparation.
   - There is no mention of a past attempt by the author.
   - Therefore, it does not fit 'ideation' (which requires explicit *personal* suicidal expression), 'behavior', or 'attempt'. It best fits 'indicator' as it lacks explicit personal suicidal expression from the author.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""tired of having to live,"" ""Dead"" in five years) which constitutes explicit suicidal expression. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or any tendency to act on these thoughts, nor any historical self-harm or suicide attempts.

I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning since it was pretty deep and I didn't know how to swim. So some how she convince me not to."" This describes a past *tendency* or *thought* of self-harm that was averted, not a completed attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""suicide by a train is on my mind"", ""will it instantly kill me"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""jumping in and drowning"" (past), ""suicide by a train"", ""put neck on the train tracks"" (current/future)).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" indicates a specific future plan with a timeline. The question ""if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"" indicates seeking information about a specific method, which is part of planning/tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
     - Past: The lake incident at age 10/11 refers to a historical *tendency* or *thought* of self-harm that was averted.
     - Current/Future: ""Now I'm 16 depressed..."", ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", ""I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"". This clearly indicates current ideation with a future plan.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the lake incident was a thought/tendency that was stopped, not a completed attempt.

   - It also mentions a historical experience of self-harm *behaviour* (the averted lake incident at age 10/11, which was a tendency to act out self-harm).
   - This fits the definition of 'behavior' which includes explicit suicidal expression, a plan or tendency to act out self-harm/suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour. It goes beyond mere 'ideation' due to the plan and tendency, and the past incident was not a completed 'attempt'.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try"" indicates a concerning consideration or normalization of the idea of suicide, which is a form of explicit suicidal expression, but not a direct statement of current intent to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past ""suicidal thoughts"" and current ""thinking about it"" and a new feeling/ideation (""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try""). The phrase ""it's now ok to try"" suggests a potential future consideration, but it's framed as a thought process rather than a concrete intention or plan.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past attempts by the poster are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try"") and mentions ongoing ""suicidal thoughts."" However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or clear tendency to act on these thoughts. The poster also expresses a desire to ""not want to think like this anymore,"" indicating a struggle with the ideation rather than a firm commitment to action. The mention of someone else's attempt triggering these thoughts is relevant context, but the classification is based on the poster's own risk. This fits the definition of 'ideation' as explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide.

378,"not sure what to call this-. i don't know how to describe it, but it feels like i disassociate sometimes. granted, it could just be adhd stuff along with a part of my extreme dysphoria and never feeling like i'm the person i appear as; but, it doesn't feel like i'm in my body. like i'm simply watching someone work and live while i only watch. when others call for me or start conversations, it's like i'm not a part of it. i can't fully think when i talk or write, like i act without my own permission. i feel so disconnected from life in itself already, to the point where my emotions never act how i want. even when it came to serious topics such as my dog's passing or nearly killing myself one night, i don't feel really anything for it. i just sit there and watch people express themselves, not knowing what to do. when i see others sad or stressed, i can't feel the same or help. everything seems so far out of my touch, like it's not even real at some times. i can write things down or do something earlier that day, only to feel as if it were fake or like i wasn't actually doing it/there. this doesn't held that i lucid dream so often that, when i wake back up, real life feels more as a dream than my actual dreams. i zone out fairly often to the point of not realizing where i am or what i was doing prior. i want to talk to a therapist about it, but i have no money nor insurance to talk to one. not like i'd even trust a therapist fully with how trashy past ones have treated me. and i've already caused enough trouble for my parents. all i can do is watch days pass by without me even realizing it. dealing with constant bad moods from my dad, to the point where he throws things at times, and barely seeing my mom as she works. it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""nearly killing myself one night"" and contemplates future action: ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses profound feelings of dissociation (""don't feel like i'm in my body,"" ""disconnected from life""), emotional numbness (""don't feel really anything for it""), and a sense of being out of control.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Methods are mentioned (""step off a building or over a bridge""), but framed as a potential impulsive future act (""without thinking""), not a concrete, immediate plan. No signs of preparation are present.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, ""nearly killing myself one night"" is a direct reference to a past serious suicidal act or near-attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""nearly killing myself"" and ""step off a building or over a bridge.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post expresses a desire for control through suicide (""Maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself""), which implies a desire to escape the current state of disconnection, potentially through death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""step off a building or over a bridge.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The phrasing ""without thinking"" suggests impulsivity rather than preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both:
        *   Past event: ""nearly killing myself one night.""
        *   Future intention/contemplation: ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""nearly killing myself one night"" clearly describes a historical experience of a suicide attempt or a very serious act with suicidal intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   The phrase ""nearly killing myself one night"" directly aligns with the definition of 'attempt': ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This is a strong and clear indicator.
    *   While there is also current ideation and contemplation of future methods (which might fit 'behavior' if it were the only element), the explicit mention of a past suicide attempt is the defining factor according to the provided categories.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""shits not worth it anymore"", ""need a way out"", ""want to take myself out"", ""i just need it to stop."" ""Take myself out"" is a clear euphemism for suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i need help"", ""don't want to deal with it"", ""disappoint and burden other people"", ""scared it'll be painful"", ""i just can't go to anyone"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, feeling overwhelmed, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan or method is mentioned. The user explicitly asks ""what do i do, please?"" and expresses fear about pain, indicating a lack of a concrete plan and a search for one.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""want to take myself out"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""shits not worth it anymore"", ""need a way out"", ""i just need it to stop.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and future intentions (""i want to take myself out"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""want to take myself out"", ""need a way out"").
   - However, there is no concrete plan or specific method identified. The user is actively asking for a way out and expressing fear about the pain of potential methods, indicating a lack of a decided plan or immediate tendency to act on a specific method.
   - This aligns with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" It does not meet the criteria for 'behavior' because there is no concrete plan or tendency to act out a specific plan, nor any mention of historical self-harm behavior. It is clearly not 'indicator' or 'attempt'.

   - Emotional indicators: Overwhelming hate, despair, hopelessness, anxiety, feeling trapped (""shoveling shit for 30+ years"", ""motherfucking imploding"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it. I don't want to wuss out and then regret sending them."" This indicates a preparatory step (sending emails) *before* an intended action.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts. ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop"" refers to persistent ideation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""So many people commit suicide"", ""I've only thought about killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Must end this shit show"", ""I'm very OVER this shit"", ""My life is ruined"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the mention of ""emails to send to my parents before I do it"" is a clear sign of preparation for a suicidal act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions (""Must end this shit show"", ""emails to send... before I do it"", ""I don't want to wuss out""). The 5 years of thinking about killing oneself refers to past ideation, but the current context is one of active planning/preparation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I've only thought about killing myself"", ""So many people commit suicide"", ""Must end this shit show"").
   - Crucially, the phrase ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it. I don't want to wuss out and then regret sending them"" indicates a concrete preparatory step or a plan/tendency to act out suicide. This goes beyond mere ideation.
   - It does not describe a recent or historical suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, the category 'behavior' which includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" is the best fit.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post repeatedly questions the desire to live (""how people can want to live?"", ""how they actually find important to stay alive?""), expresses a negative view of the remaining lifespan (""60 fucking years left"", ""have to live 60 years more""), and implies that life isn't worth living (""it wasn't really good""). While not explicitly using the word ""suicide,"" it strongly conveys a lack of will to live.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, existential weariness, questioning the purpose of life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, the repeated questioning of *why* people would want to live, combined with the negative framing of the author's own remaining lifespan, strongly implies a desire *not* to be alive or a profound lack of desire to continue living. This constitutes an explicit suicidal expression in its questioning of the value of life itself.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to current feelings and future prospects (""I have 60 fucking years left"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression through its profound questioning of the value of life and the implied lack of desire to continue living.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act on these feelings.
    *   There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""passive suicidal"", ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal"", ""suicide by cop"".
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses concern and frustration about how others might handle a suicidal person, but it does not express the poster's own emotional state related to suicide.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""suicide by cop"" is mentioned, but as a potential outcome for *someone else*, not a plan for the person writing the post.
   - References to past attempts: None for the person writing the post.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, terms like ""suicidal"" and ""suicide by cop"" are used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the perspective of the person writing the post. The post is a commentary on how *other people* might react or be affected.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""suicide by cop"" is mentioned, but it refers to a potential action by *someone else*, not the poster.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It's a general cautionary statement about a hypothetical situation involving *other people*. It does not describe the poster's own past, current, or future suicidal intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, not for the poster.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post discusses suicide and suicidal states, but it is a general observation or warning about how to interact with *other people* who are suicidal.
   - The crucial rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".
   - Based on this, the post does not contain any explicit suicidal expression from the person writing it. It is a discussion about a sensitive topic, but it does not indicate the poster's own suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post uses euphemisms like ""the way I choose to go"" in the context of using insulin, which strongly implies suicide. It also mentions ""Had a plan in mind ever since,"" ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it,"" and ""Thought about doing it a couple times.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life,"" ""hate being a burden.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, a specific method is identified: ""with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go."" The means is an ""insulin pump."" The post discusses the ease and accessibility of this method compared to others (""getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible"").
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post states, ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up."" This indicates past ideation and planning, but explicitly states these plans were *not* acted upon. The ""almost went into shock"" part seems to be related to medical management of diabetes, not a deliberate attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not the word ""suicide,"" but the intent is clearly expressed through euphemisms and detailed planning.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by ""the way I choose to go"" and the detailed consideration of methods to end one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, using an ""insulin pump"" to administer ""100s of units of insulin.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The individual is considering the acquisition of the means (the pump) if their condition deteriorates, and has already formulated ""a plan in mind"" and ""a couple ideas for how to do it.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current thoughts and future intentions (""think that might be the way I choose to go,"" ""if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible""). It also references past ideation/planning (""Had a plan in mind ever since,"" ""Thought about doing it a couple times"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, past instances were thoughts/plans that were not acted upon (""didn't because it was such a hassle to set up"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (though euphemistic).
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a specific *plan* (insulin overdose via pump) and discussing the *tendency to act out* by identifying the ""easiest and most accessible"" method and considering it for future use.
    *   While it mentions past thoughts of suicide, it explicitly states these were not acted upon, so it doesn't describe a historical *attempt*.
    *   The presence of a clear plan and a discussion of the means and accessibility to act on it aligns with the ""behavior"" category's definition: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""

   - Emotional indicators: ""☹️"", ""nobody told me happy birthday or anything . they just walked past me like I was nothing … it's not even about that im just tired of everything ! Worst birthday ever !"". These indicate severe distress, feelings of worthlessness, and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method is mentioned, but ""I have a chance right now"" indicates a perceived immediate opportunity or means to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current intentions and perceived immediate opportunity (""I do and I have a chance right now"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill yourself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" goes beyond mere ideation (just thinking about it). It implies a present opportunity or means to act, which falls under ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". While not a detailed plan, it signifies a step beyond pure thought towards potential action.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*.
   - Therefore, the post fits the 'behavior' category, which includes explicit suicidal expression and a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide"". It also contains phrases like ""I don't want to do this anymore"" and ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit"", which express a desire to end current suffering or a nihilistic view on life's value.
   - Emotional indicators: High levels of stress, despair, hopelessness, confusion, feeling pathetic, and a sense of desolation are evident (""stressed"", ""bawling"", ""mental health...bad"", ""incredibly difficult"", ""terrible"", ""fucked up my head"", ""confused"", ""desolate"", ""pathetic"", ""this all means nothing"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned. The post explicitly states, ""throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it"" regarding suicide, indicating no past ideation or attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm finally considering suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to do this anymore"" and ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit"" imply a desire to cease existing or a profound lack of will to live.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current overwhelming stress and a *current* consideration of suicide (""I'm finally considering suicide"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the post indicates this is a new consideration for the individual.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""considering suicide""). This eliminates 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or any steps taken towards self-harm or suicide. This rules out 'behavior'.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
   - The content clearly shows explicit suicidal expression (""considering suicide"") but lacks any concrete plan or tendency to act out suicide. This perfectly matches the definition of 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""attempted to end my life"", ""kill myself"", ""ready leave everything"", ""almost committed"". ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"" indicates self-harm as part of the attempt.
   - Emotional indicators: ""shaking and bawling"", ""worst feeling"", ""worst suspense"", ""too much of a pussy"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""put down my knife"", ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"" (method: knife, target: wrists/thighs).

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I just attempted to end my life."" is a clear description of a recent, physical attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I just attempted to end my life."" and describes the immediate physical consequences (""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"") and the mental state during and after the attempt. This directly aligns with the definition of the 'attempt' category: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt"".

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""my plan to kill myself"".

   - The crucial element is the explicit mention of ""my plan"". This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) and indicates a formulated intention to act.
   - The category 'behavior' states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The phrase ""my plan to kill myself"" directly indicates the existence of a plan. The frustration about being prevented also suggests a continued tendency or desire to act on it.
   - It is not 'ideation' because a ""plan"" is explicitly mentioned, which is a step beyond just having thoughts.
   - It is not 'attempt' as no actual attempt is described, only a plan that was revealed and prevented.
   - It is not 'indicator' as there is clear explicit suicidal expression.
   - Therefore, the explicit mention of a ""plan"" aligns best with the 'behavior' category.

I feel like shit and I need to vent about it or just talk to someone about random basic things to feel a little less alone and depressed right now. To at least pretend that I have a friend. If you want to, PM me please. I'm 21, I'm not malicious I'm just fucking sad.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel like shit"", ""depressed"", ""fucking sad"", ""feel a little less alone"". These indicate significant emotional distress, loneliness, and a desire for connection.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The user is seeking social interaction (phone call, Discord voice call) as a coping mechanism.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses profound sadness and loneliness, but not a direct wish to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings (""right now"") and a current need for social interaction.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, there is no explicit suicidal expression, no plan, no mention of self-harm or suicide attempts. The post conveys significant emotional distress and loneliness, which are risk factors, but does not cross the threshold into explicit ideation, behavior, or attempt. It signals a need for support due to mental state, fitting the 'indicator' category.

398,"I wrote a note today. I've been struggling with this my whole life. But always I felt that there was some light at the end of the tunnel if only i could just get to it. Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more"", ""I just can't continue"", ""I can't keep going like this"", ""I'm at the end of my rope"", ""at my wits end"". The phrase ""I wrote a note today"" is a strong indicator of preparation for suicide.
   - Note emotional indicators: ""struggling"", ""light has disappeared"", ""severe anxiety"", ""worthless person"", ""don't know what to do anymore"", ""more harm than good"", ""no results"", ""last chance at asking for help"".
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I wrote a note today."" This indicates a preparatory action. No specific method (e.g., tool, location) is mentioned.
   - Check for references to past attempts: The post mentions ""ended up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital"" and past ""in patient treatment"" and ""outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years"", but it does not explicitly state these were due to a suicide *attempt*. It describes a mental health crisis and failed treatment, but not a past *attempt*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more"", ""I just can't continue"", ""I can't keep going like this"", ""I'm at the end of my rope"", ""at my wits end"" strongly convey a desire to end life or an inability to continue living.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I wrote a note today"" is a clear sign of preparation for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I wrote a note today"" refers to a current/recent preparatory action. ""Lately It seems like that light has disappeared"", ""I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope"", ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this"", ""I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this"" all refer to current feelings and future intentions/despair. Past events mentioned (ER, hospital, past treatments) are contextual but not described as past attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, past suicide attempts are not explicitly described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal ideation (""I just can't continue"", ""fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more"").
   - Crucially, the phrase ""I wrote a note today"" indicates a concrete preparatory action towards suicide. This moves the post beyond mere ideation into the realm of active planning or tendency to act.
   - The category 'behavior' states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
   - While no specific *method* is detailed, writing a note is a significant *tendency/preparation* to act out suicide. There is no explicit mention of a past *attempt*.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression and the clear sign of preparation (""I wrote a note today""), the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate fit.

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end my life"" is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The repetition ""Tried didn't work. Tried... Didn't work."" suggests ongoing distress and failed attempts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods or plans are mentioned, but the word ""Tried"" indicates an action was taken.
   - References to past attempts: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" This clearly describes past actions that were attempts to end life. The word ""again"" implies multiple past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end my life"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Tried to end my life"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - However, the phrase ""Tried didn't work"" signifies that an *action* was taken, not just a thought or plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to past events: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" These are descriptions of historical actions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" is a direct description of a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" This directly aligns with the definition of the 'attempt' category, which includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" It's not just ideation (thoughts) or behavior (tendency/plan/self-harm), but a clear description of a past action aimed at ending life.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post is entirely focused on a chronic medical condition (post-concussion syndrome) and the symptoms experienced.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The user states, ""Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much."" This indicates hopelessness and despair, but specifically in the context of their unresolved medical symptoms and lack of effective treatment, not explicitly about wanting to end their life.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""I really don't know what to do anymore"" refers to their medical situation and the search for relief, not a desire to cease living.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a past injury (7 months ago) and ongoing, current symptoms and feelings of hopelessness related to those symptoms. There are no past or future suicidal intentions mentioned.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness, but this is directly tied to a chronic medical condition and the failure of various treatments.
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or any desire to die.
   - The emotional state, while severe, does not cross the threshold into suicidal ideation or behavior based on the provided definitions.
   - Therefore, it falls under the 'indicator' category, as it has no explicit suicidal expression.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Mentions methods like ""bullet in my head,"" ""stomp me out,"" and ""slit my fucking throat."" However, the post explicitly states, ""I have no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway."" The methods described are wishes for external action upon them, not actions they intend to take themselves.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, through phrases like ""I deserve to die,"" ""deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" and ""slit my fucking throat.""

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains very strong and explicit suicidal expressions (""I deserve to die,"" ""deserve a bullet in my head,"" ""slit my fucking throat""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I have no plans"" and ""I don't think I'd succeed anyway."" While methods are *mentioned*, they are presented as wishes for someone else to inflict harm, not as plans the individual intends to carry out. There is no ""tendency to commit suicide"" by the individual themselves, as they state they have no plans.
    *   There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts, nor any indication of a current plan or active tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. This rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'ideation' category: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I will die alone."", ""My parents don't deserve to bury their child."" (implies death by suicide), ""But the second they're gone, so am I."" (explicitly states intention to die when parents are gone).
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I will die alone."", ""it isn't coming back."", ""Noone. So that's my company, forever. Noone.""), despair (""I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness.""), self-loathing (""I'm a hideous fucking mutant"", ""fat retard like me"", ""sad man"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""But the second they're gone, so am I."" is a very direct and explicit expression of intent to end their life. ""I will die alone."" also expresses a desire for death.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I will die alone."", ""But the second they're gone, so am I.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings and future intentions (""I will die alone."", ""But the second they're gone, so am I."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I will die alone."", ""But the second they're gone, so am I.""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The intent is conditional on a future event (""the second they're gone"") rather than an immediate tendency to act out. There are no mentions of historical self-harm *behavior* or *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by explicitly stating ""I have a plan but no date set"". This indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicitly mentioned twice. The phrase ""grave I dug myself"" is a metaphor for a difficult, seemingly inescapable situation, implying deep despair or feeling trapped.
   - Emotional indicators: ""less likely to talk about"", ""massive issue"", ""lot of stress"", ""tough enough"", ""lying"", ""not sure if I'm strong enough"" – these indicate distress, avoidance, feeling overwhelmed, and a sense of hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression of wanting to die, but the explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" and the feeling of being in a ""grave I dug myself"" strongly imply a struggle with the desire to not be alive or to escape current suffering.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current and increasing frequency of ""suicidal thoughts"" (""Well it's great till it starts to happen more and more frequently""). The feeling of being in a ""grave"" is current.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts"") and indicates these thoughts are ongoing and increasing in frequency.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act on these thoughts.
   - There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - Therefore, the post fits the 'ideation' category, as it describes explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""nearly killing myself"" (past event), ""I fucking hate living"" (current emotional state).
   - Emotional indicators: ""hate"", ""rotting away"", ""fucking hate living"", ""what the fuck did I do wrong?"", ""Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?"" (despair, hopelessness, anger, victimhood).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""shooting up the school"" is mentioned, but it's attributed to the ex-friend bullying the poster *into* it, not the poster's current intention or plan for self-harm. There are no current plans or methods for self-harm/suicide by the poster.
   - References to past attempts: ""nearly killing myself"" refers to a past close call or strong suicidal ideation/behavior, indicating a historical high-risk state.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""nearly killing myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I fucking hate living"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No current methods for self-harm/suicide by the poster are mentioned. The ""shooting up the school"" context is about being bullied into it, not a current plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - ""nearly killing myself"" refers to a past event/state.
   - ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away. I fucking hate living"" refers to current feelings and intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I fucking hate living""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post does not describe a *current* plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.
   - However, the post mentions ""nearly killing myself,"" which signifies a ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" or a very strong past tendency to act out self-harm/suicide. The 'behavior' category explicitly includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
   - While ""nearly killing myself"" is not explicitly a ""suicide attempt"" (which would fit the 'attempt' category), it strongly implies a past state where the individual was on the verge of or engaged in actions that could be classified as self-harm behavior. This fits the criteria for 'behavior' more accurately than 'ideation' (which implies no plan or tendency, even historically, to act out).

    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""kill yourself"", ""I wanted to [die]"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I wanted to [die]"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The act itself implies preparation (acquiring the pills and liquor).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** This clearly refers to a *past* event: ""Survived OD"", ""When I sat there and swallowed..."", ""held off going to the hospital"", ""my boyfriend said I did"". The phrase ""I'm still processing everything"" indicates reflection on a past event.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** Yes, the entire post is a detailed description of a past overdose, which is presented as a suicide attempt (""I wanted to [die]"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""Survived OD"" and details the actions taken during that overdose (""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor"") with the clear intent of dying (""I wanted to [die]""). This directly matches the definition of the 'attempt' category, which includes ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""

Every action is malicious."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""find a way to get away from it all"" and ""quick solution"" are desires for an end, but not a method.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    Based on the analysis:
    *   There is clear and explicit suicidal expression (""Suicide has become my quick solution,"" ""want to find a way to get away from it all""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or any steps taken towards acting on these thoughts. This distinguishes it from 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'ideation' perfectly: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" The user expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end their suffering, but without outlining how or when they would do so.

It slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away. I wonder if a long-term cure even exists.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of suicide or self-harm. ""death stranding"" is a game title, not a direct reference to the user's state of dying.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hard to keep going"", ""Every day feels like the previous one"", ""badly mangled (psychically)"", ""slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away"", ""I wonder if a long-term cure even exists."" These indicate severe depression, hopelessness, feeling misunderstood, and a sense of permanence of their suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""hard to keep going"" expresses difficulty in continuing life/struggles, but it is not a direct or explicit statement of wanting to die or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and ongoing struggle (""Every day feels like the previous one"", ""never really goes away"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a profound struggle with depression and hopelessness.
   - There is no explicit suicidal expression (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself""). The phrase ""hard to keep going"" is ambiguous and does not meet the ""explicit suicidal expression"" criteria for 'ideation'.
   - There are no mentions of plans, methods, or preparations.
   - There are no mentions of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - Based on the definitions, 'indicator' is for posts with ""no explicit suicidal expression"". This post fits that description, despite the severe emotional distress described. It indicates a high risk for developing ideation, but is not ideation itself.

   - References to past attempts: The post mentions the father's past suicide, but no past attempts by the person writing the post. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I get suicidal thoughts"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I get suicidal thoughts"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation. The phrase ""it's inevitable for me"" also points to a fatalistic view of their own future suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I get suicidal thoughts"" refers to current/ongoing thoughts. ""it's inevitable for me"" refers to a perceived future outcome. The father's suicide is a past event.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past attempts by the poster are described.

For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post is filled with quotes from the parents directed at the poster, explicitly mentioning ""kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""try to kill yourself again,"" and ""cut your wrists again."" There's also a mention of ""vomit your food again,"" which could imply self-harm or an eating disorder.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The entire post conveys extreme emotional abuse, neglect, and a complete lack of empathy from the parents towards the poster's depression and distress. The poster is clearly in a highly vulnerable and painful situation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific *current* plans or preparations are stated by the poster. However, the parents' quotes mention ""a gun,"" ""shoot yourself,"" and ""cut your wrists"" in the context of the poster's past or potential actions.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, explicitly and repeatedly. Parents say: ""What? Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", and ""Why are you crying? Are you going to cut your wrists again?"". These clearly indicate a history of suicide attempts and self-harm behavior by the person writing the post.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, repeatedly, through the parents' direct quotes to the poster.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Not directly from the poster in this specific post, but the parents' quotes strongly imply the poster has had such expressions or actions in the past.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""gun,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""cut your wrists"" are mentioned by the parents in reference to the poster's past or potential actions.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No signs of preparation mentioned by the poster.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post heavily refers to *past* events and *past* attempts/self-harm behaviors (""again""). The parents' comments like ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" clearly indicate a historical pattern of such actions by the poster.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"") and ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"").
    *   The 'attempt' category is defined as: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, *or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*.""
    *   The 'behavior' category is defined as: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*.""
    *   Since the post contains clear references to *historical suicide attempts* by the person writing the post, the 'attempt' category is the most accurate and specific classification.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again."" This indicates an intention to perform a preparatory action related to suicide.
    *   References to past attempts: ""again"" refers to a past instance of writing a suicidal note, which is a historical experience of a specific suicidal behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal note"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly, but the intent to write a ""suicidal note"" strongly implies this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The method is ""writing a suicidal note,"" which is a preparatory action.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the stated intention to ""write a suicidal note"" is a sign of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I think I'm going to write..."" refers to a current intention for a future action. ""again"" refers to a past event of writing such a note.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? It describes a past *behavior* (writing a note), not a past *suicide attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression and a clear intention/plan.
    *   'ideation': While there is explicit suicidal expression, there is also a stated intention to act (""going to write a suicidal note"") and a reference to past behavior (""again""). This goes beyond mere ideation.
    *   'behavior': The post has explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal note""). There is a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" (the act of writing a suicidal note is a preparatory step, a tendency to act out). It also mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""again"" referring to past note writing). This category fits well.
    *   'attempt': The post does not describe a recent or historical suicide attempt. It describes a preparatory behavior.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly indicates explicit suicidal expression and a tendency to act out (writing the note), along with a historical experience of this behavior.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""slaying myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide/self-harm. ""committing a massacre"" is also a violent thought, but the focus for suicide risk is the self-directed violence.
    *   Emotional indicators: Not explicitly stated, but the nature of the statement implies distress or violent ideation.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""slaying myself"" indicates a method (killing oneself), but no specific tool, location, or detailed preparation is mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""slaying myself"" is an explicit expression of suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""slaying myself"" directly expresses a desire or intention to end one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? A general method (""slaying myself"") is mentioned, but not specific tools, locations, or detailed steps.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I will end up... or maybe just slaying myself"" refers to a future intention or prediction.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""slaying myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The phrasing ""I will end up... slaying myself"" suggests a strong inclination or prediction of future action. This implies a ""tendency to act out"" rather than just a fleeting thought or wish. While a detailed plan is absent, the statement of a future outcome involving self-harm points towards a tendency.
    *   Comparing 'ideation' (""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"") and 'behavior' (""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide""): The phrase ""I will end up"" indicates a strong likelihood or internal drive towards this action, fitting the ""tendency to act out"" criterion for 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression and the implied tendency to act out (indicated by ""I will end up""), 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" However, it also explicitly states ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live"".
   - Emotional indicators: Feelings of laziness, shame, feeling stupid, overwhelmed, outclassed, intimidated, desire for friends and a girlfriend, desire to overcome passivity and mediocrity.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal ideation"" is mentioned.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, on the contrary, the post explicitly states: ""I don't want to die— I want to live"". The mention of ""suicidal ideation"" is framed as an analytical understanding of a past or ongoing internal state, not a current desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current struggles with passivity and a desire for future improvement (""I want to live,"" ""I want to be an activist,"" ""I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do""). The ""suicidal ideation"" is presented as something the user has analyzed and understood its origin, and explicitly states a desire *not* to die.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation."" However, it immediately clarifies this by stating ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" This is a crucial distinction. The user is acknowledging the *presence* of such thoughts (ideation) but explicitly rejecting the desire to act on them or to die. The overall tone is one of frustration with current life circumstances (laziness, lack of social connection) and a strong desire to improve and live. This fits the ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues"" part of the 'indicator' category, as the user is actively stating a desire to live despite having experienced suicidal thoughts. There is no ""tendency to commit suicide"" as required for 'ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""decide whether or not I'll live till October"", ""don't wanna die"", ""cannot live if i fail"", ""no place to jump from"", ""blades i used to cut won't go that deep"", ""how I'll do it"" (ambiguous, but in context of feeling better).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""for the first time i don't wanna die"", ""almost happy"", ""almost enjoying doing stuff"", ""I'm in a decent place right now"", ""I'm feeling better nonetheless"". There's a clear shift towards positive emotions and a desire to live.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Mentions ""meds"", ""place to jump from"", ""blades"" but explicitly states *lack* of access or effectiveness (""no access to my meds"", ""no place to jump from"", ""blades i used to cut won't go that deep""). This indicates a *lack* of current viable means or plans.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""blades i used to cut"" implies past self-harm, but not necessarily a past *suicide attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post states ""cannot live if i fail"" (conditional), but immediately counteracts this with ""for the first time i don't wanna die"" and expressions of wanting to live and do things. The overall sentiment is a *rejection* of wanting to die *now*.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""meds"", ""place to jump from"", ""blades"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, the post explicitly states a *lack* of means and preparation (""no access"", ""no place"", ""won't go that deep"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""blades i used to cut"" refers to past self-harm. ""The final test... is coming up"" refers to a future conditional event. The dominant theme is current positive feelings (""I'm in a decent place right now"", ""I'm feeling better"") and future plans for living (""making plans to move"", ""stuff i wanna do for my new room""). The post expresses a current desire *not* to die.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains mentions of past self-harm and a conditional future trigger for suicidal thoughts (""cannot live if i fail""). However, the overwhelming sentiment is a strong shift *away* from suicidal intent. The user explicitly states ""for the first time i don't wanna die"", expresses feeling ""almost happy"" and ""better"", and details plans for living (""making plans to move"", ""stuff i wanna do for my new room""). They also note the *lack* of current means for self-harm/suicide.
    *   This fits the 'indicator' category: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" The post clearly expresses a *resolved* or significantly *diminished* suicidal state, despite past struggles and a conditional future concern. It's a positive shift.
    *   It's not 'ideation' because the explicit suicidal expression is largely negated by the current positive outlook and desire to live.
    *   It's not 'behavior' because there's no current plan or tendency to act, and while past self-harm is mentioned, the current state is one of resolution.
    *   It's not 'attempt' as no recent or historical suicide attempt is described, only past self-harm.

The key takeaway is the explicit statement of *not wanting to die* and feeling better, indicating a resolved or diminishing suicidal issue.

School and work have drained me the fuck out of all my motivation in the things I love. And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time. I believe we're stuck in a system and forced to be milked out of work labor until we're exhausted and thrown out. This neverending process only helps the things I hate the most, and I don't know what to do anymore with my life.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""drained me the fuck out of all my motivation"", ""taken my will to strive"", ""don't know what to do anymore with my life"", ""exhausted and thrown out"", ""neverending process only helps the things I hate the most"". These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, and a feeling of being trapped and purposeless.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""don't know what to do anymore with my life"" expresses a profound sense of lost direction and purpose, but not a direct wish for death or non-existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It describes current feelings of despair and a general outlook on life (""This neverending process"", ""don't know what to do anymore with my life"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a loss of purpose (""don't know what to do anymore with my life""). These are strong *indicators* of potential risk.
   - However, there is *no explicit suicidal expression* (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself"").
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'indicator' applies when there is ""no explicit suicidal expression"".
     - 'ideation' requires ""explicit suicidal expression"".
     - 'behavior' and 'attempt' also require explicit suicidal expression or mention of specific actions/attempts.
   - Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die, despite the severe distress, the post falls under the 'indicator' category.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Explicitly mentions ""kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"", or ""start cutting myself"". The phrase ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"" indicates a strong intention to act, with or without a specific condition. The detailed description of the aftermath (""My body probably wouldn't be found for months"", ""if im far enough away and cut off enough, then it'll never be know that I died"") suggests a degree of planning or thought about the act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, multiple methods are listed: ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"", ""shoot myself with a gun"", ""start cutting myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"" indicates a strong intention and readiness to act, regardless of a specific condition. The detailed thoughts about the aftermath (body not found, cutting off contact) suggest a mental preparation for the act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current and future intentions (""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"", ""I'm just waiting for the end"", ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because it clearly outlines specific methods (""slitting my wrist"", ""shoot myself"", ""cutting myself"") and expresses a strong intention and readiness to act (""I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"", ""I'm just waiting for the end"", ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness""). This aligns with ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*, which would be required for the 'attempt' category. The mention of ""start cutting myself"" could be interpreted as a future self-harm behavior.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression, the mention of specific methods, and the clear intention/tendency to act, the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate fit.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

    *   **ideation:** Ruled out. While there is explicit suicidal expression, there are clear plans and tendencies to act out self-harm/suicide, not just thoughts.
    *   **behavior:** This category fits. The post has explicit suicidal expression (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die,"" ""contemplating suicide""). Crucially, it also describes a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through the detailed methods contemplated, calculations, testing, and the explicit statement ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself."" The fact that the user is currently held back by a specific belief (""I don't deserve to...

There is no mention of historical self-harm *behavior* (acting it out), but the first part of the definition is strongly met.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""the day i chose is very soon"" (indicates a chosen date, which is a specific element of a plan). The contemplation of calling loved ones (""call my grandparents"", ""telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother"") and the concern about ""haunt people more or something"" strongly suggest preparations for saying goodbyes, which is a common pre-suicidal behavior. The statement ""i'm not interested in being talked down at all"" indicates a firm decision.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past *attempts*. ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to long-term ideation, not past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Phrases like ""shouldn't kill myself"", ""anti suicide discourse"", and ""i've wanted to do this"" directly refer to suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, substance) is mentioned.

The contemplation of final goodbyes to family and friends (""calling people?"", ""telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother"") is a strong sign of preparation for an impending act. The rejection of intervention (""not interested in being talked down"") further supports a firm decision to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions. ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates an imminent future event. The thoughts about calling people are current considerations for a future act. ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to past *ideation*, but the current context is about acting on it soon.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression and it is not resolved.
    *   **ideation:** Incorrect. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post goes beyond mere ideation. The mention of ""the day i chose is very soon"" and the contemplation of saying goodbyes (calling grandparents, telling friends ""I love them"", hugging brother) clearly indicate a *plan* and a *tendency to act out*.
    *   **behavior:** Correct. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""i shouldn't kill myself"", ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"", ""i'm not cut out for life""). Crucially, it also indicates a *plan* (""the day i chose is very soon"") and a *tendency to act out* (contemplating final goodbyes, rejecting ""anti suicide discourse"" and being ""talked down""). These elements align perfectly with the definition of the 'behavior' category.
    *   **attempt:** Incorrect. There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*. The post describes intent and preparation, not a past or ongoing attempt.

   - Emotional indicators: ""pain for over 5 years"", ""just cba anymore"" (can't be bothered, indicating exhaustion/hopelessness), ""misery"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None explicitly mentioned. ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" indicates withdrawal/isolation, which can be a concerning sign, but not a direct plan or method for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past *attempts*. ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" refers to past *feelings* or *ideation*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" suggests withdrawal, which can precede suicidal acts, but it is not a direct plan or acquisition of means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""feel like abandoning everyone"", ""This the most suicidal I've been"", ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" refer to current intense feelings and intentions. ""In a couple months"" refers to the intensity of current feelings compared to recent past.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""most suicidal I've been"", ""want to be out of my misery""). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or a clear tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. There is also no mention of a past suicide attempt or self-harm behavior. The withdrawal (""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"") is a concerning symptom of distress and ideation, but not a plan or behavior itself. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""can't find a suitable way to go"" implies an active search for means, which suggests a tendency towards preparation, even if unsuccessful so far.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions (""I just want to die"", ""I just want to kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I just want to die"", ""I just want to kill myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a past or recent attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' is crucial. 'Ideation' states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" 'Behavior' states ""there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - The phrase ""but I can't find a suitable way to go"" indicates more than just passive suicidal thoughts. It shows an active desire to find a method and a current struggle to do so, which constitutes a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" The individual is actively seeking means, even if they haven't found one yet. This active search for a method moves it beyond mere ideation.

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains ""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP"". This is a death wish directed at *another person*, not the poster.
   - Note emotional indicators: Extreme anger, rage, desire for revenge.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the poster's own harm.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not by the poster about themselves.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not by the poster about themselves. The expression of death is directed outwards.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the poster's own harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current/future wish for *another person*.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post expresses extreme anger and a death wish towards *another person*. There is no content indicating the poster's own suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt. According to the rules, ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" Since there is no explicit suicidal expression from the poster about themselves, the 'indicator' category is the most appropriate fit.

Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post repeatedly states ""I will kill my bullie,"" ""I will kill her,"" and asks ""how to murder her."" It also mentions ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Frustration, anger, desire for peace, feeling bullied.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user is *asking* for suggestions on ""how to murder her,"" indicating a desire for a plan but no concrete plan or preparation yet.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts (suicidal or homicidal) are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others."" However, this is a general statement about a type of suicide, not an expression of the poster's *own* suicidal intent. The explicit intent expressed is to kill *another person*.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The expressions are about wanting to kill someone else to ""finally live my life in peace.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No. The user is soliciting suggestions for methods (""Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?"").
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current/future intentions (""I will kill her,"" ""Do you guys have any suggestion"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The core rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   The post expresses clear homicidal intent (""I will kill her,"" ""how to murder her"").
    *   While the word ""suicide"" is used in a general context (""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others""), the poster's *own* explicit intent is directed outwards (homicide), not inwards (suicide).
    *   There is no explicit suicidal expression *from the poster about themselves*. The post does not indicate the poster wants to die or harm themselves.
    *   Based on the definition of 'indicator' (""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues.""), this post fits because it lacks explicit suicidal expression *from the poster about themselves*. The risk expressed is homicidal, not suicidal for the poster.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""on the verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end it all"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is detailed.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" goes beyond mere ideation. It indicates a concrete understanding of how to commit suicide, implying a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category as it includes explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan or tendency to act out.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings (""am tired of being unhappy"", ""am tired of being depressed"") and a strong desire for future change (""please make me straight"", ""take all thoughts away from my mind""). It also references past experiences (""molested at 5 years"", ""always had unhappy life"") that contribute to the current distress.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post conveys profound emotional pain, depression, and a desperate plea for a change in circumstances and identity (""make me normal"", ""take all gayness away"").
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any intent to self-harm. The desire is for the *suffering* to end, not for life itself to end.
   - Based on the definitions:
     - 'attempt': Not applicable, no mention of attempts.
     - 'behavior': Not applicable, no explicit suicidal expression with a plan or tendency to act out, nor historical self-harm behavior.
     - 'ideation': Not applicable, as there is no explicit suicidal expression (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm thinking of killing myself""). The distress is severe but not articulated as suicidal intent.
     - 'indicator': This fits best. The post content has no explicit suicidal expression, but the severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and desire for an end to suffering are strong indicators of potential risk, even if not explicitly suicidal.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal"" is used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While phrased as a question (""Anyone suicidal...?""), it directly implies the poster is experiencing or contemplating suicidal feelings due to their pain, or is seeking others who share such feelings. This constitutes an explicit expression of suicidal ideation, even if indirect about their *own* direct intent, it's about *their* experience of the pain leading to such thoughts. It's not a resolved issue.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" suggests a final task or preparation before an intended end. While not a specific *method* of suicide, it implies a pre-suicidal action or condition.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of the *poster's own* past attempts. Mentions someone else's suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life."" The poster connects this to their own desire: ""it gives me comfort we may see each other again,"" implying a desire to join them through death.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" ""One last record for me to make and its finally over,"" ""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" can be interpreted as a preparatory step or a condition that must be met before acting on suicidal intent. This indicates a ""tendency to act out"" or a vague plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post expresses current despair and clear future intentions regarding ending life (""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" ""One last record for me to make and its finally over,"" ""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No, only the suicide of a loved one.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm over life,"" ""give in to the nothingness that is death""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" goes beyond mere ideation. It suggests a specific, albeit vague, pre-suicidal action or condition that needs to be fulfilled before the intended end. This implies a ""tendency to act out"" or a preliminary step towards a plan, even if the method is not specified. This aligns with the 'behavior' category's definition of ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt by the poster, ruling out 'attempt'.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression and the implied preparatory step/condition (""One last record for me to make and its finally over""), the post indicates a tendency to act out, which falls under the 'behavior' category.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and ongoing planning (""I plan my suicide every single day""). The methods mentioned are for future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I plan my suicide every single day"", ""I just don't want to go on anymore"").
   - It clearly describes specific plans and methods (""using a pistol or an escape bag"", ""douse myself in gasoline and light up"") and states that this planning occurs ""every single day"". This goes beyond mere ideation and indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, which would place it in the 'attempt' category.
   - Therefore, the 'behavior' category, which includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"", is the most appropriate fit.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"", ""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come"", ""die at 50 or earlier"", ""not worth pushing my life further"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Apathy towards life/death, hopelessness (""future is really grim"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it"". However, it also states ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come."" This cessation of medical care, coupled with the acceptance of death, can be interpreted as a passive method or preparation for allowing death to occur, or a form of self-neglect/self-harm.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come"", ""not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be"". This indicates a passive acceptance of death and a lack of will to preserve life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Not an active method to *commit* suicide, but ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" is a passive action that can lead to harm or death by neglecting health. This can be considered a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through omission.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" can be seen as a preparation for allowing death to occur, rather than actively preventing it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current intentions and a current state of mind (""As of right now..."", ""I have stopped visiting..."").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come"").
    *   While it states ""I don't have any plans to end it"" (referring to active plans), the action of ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" combined with ""willing to accept when my time has come"" indicates a passive plan or a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through neglect of one's health. This goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings (ideation) and involves a concrete action (or inaction) that aligns with the desire for death. Therefore, it fits the ""behavior"" category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""starve myself"" (as a hypothetical extreme).
   - Emotional indicators: ""fucking hate myself"", ""too depressed"", ""too ugly"", ""too lazy"", ""my thyroid is too fucked up"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""starve myself or something"" is mentioned, but framed as a hypothetical extreme for weight loss, not a concrete suicide plan, and is immediately preceded by a statement of being ""too much of a coward to kill myself."" No signs of preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" implies a desire but a lack of courage/intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""starve myself or something"" is mentioned, but it's presented as a hypothetical, not a concrete plan or intention for suicide. The primary statement is about lacking the courage to act.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and hypothetical future actions (""unless I starve myself""). No past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It does not mention a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The crucial distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.
     - 'ideation': ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
     - 'behavior': ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
   - The statement ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" directly indicates a *lack* of tendency or plan to commit suicide, despite the presence of suicidal thoughts. While ""starve myself or something"" is mentioned, it's presented as a hypothetical extreme for weight loss, not a concrete suicide plan, and is overshadowed by the explicit statement of lacking courage to act. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation' as there is explicit expression but no clear plan or tendency to act.

Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>

   - Emotional indicators: The post is instructional and supportive, offering advice on how to help others. It does not convey the author's personal feelings of hopelessness or despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned by the author for themselves or for others.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned by the author for themselves or for others.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post discusses suicide, but it is entirely from the perspective of offering advice on *how to help a friend* who might be struggling with suicidal thoughts.
   - The ""IMPORTANT RULES"" state: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".
   - Since the author is not expressing their own suicidal thoughts, plans, behaviors, or attempts, the post does not indicate a personal suicide risk for the author.
   - The content is a general discussion about mental health support and does not contain any personal suicidal expression from the author. Therefore, it falls under the 'indicator' category as it has no explicit suicidal expression from the author.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness, despair, feeling abandoned, feeling like a burden/waste, severe emotional pain, feeling trapped, feeling like there's no escape or help.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No explicit, detailed plan (e.g., specific time, location, method). However, there are clear signs of self-destructive behaviors and removal of protective factors: ""stopped taking my medication"", ""been drinking heavily"", ""took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end"", ""I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me"". The statement ""will only drive me further to killing myself"" indicates a strong internal drive towards action.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *suicide* method is detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the cessation of medication, heavy drinking, and the impending lack of Ativan (which is described as the only thing preventing ""going off the deep end"") are strong indicators of removing protective factors and engaging in behaviors that increase immediate risk, suggesting a *tendency to act out* or move towards self-harm/suicide. The statement ""it just seems like the end to me"" directly links the lack of Ativan to a suicidal outcome.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current distress and future intentions/tendencies (""no reason to live"", ""it's time to die"", ""killing myself""). The past events (breakup, family issues) provide context for the current state.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing myself"", ""time to die""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation. The user describes concrete actions (stopping medication, heavy drinking) and the impending loss of a crucial coping mechanism (Ativan) which they explicitly state is ""the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end"" and that its absence ""just seems like the end to me"". This indicates a clear *tendency to act out* self-harm or suicide by removing barriers and engaging in risky behaviors, even without a fully formed, detailed plan. The phrase ""will only drive me further to killing myself"" reinforces this internal drive towards action. This fits the definition of 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""not to kill myself"", ""postpone any suicide attempts"".
   - Emotional indicators: The overall tone is positive and hopeful (""all I've ever wanted in life :)"", ""I need to know what happens""), indicating a newfound reason to live, despite the past consideration of suicide.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" implies that suicide attempts were a consideration or a potential future action, but it does not describe a past *actual* attempt. It refers to *future prevention* of attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post expresses the opposite: a reason *not* to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/future intentions, specifically the *postponement* of potential future suicide attempts due to a new reason to live. It implies that suicide was a past consideration, but is now resolved or put on hold.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide.
   - However, the core message is that the individual has found a reason *not* to commit suicide and that their suicidal thoughts/tendencies are now *resolved* or *postponed*.
   - There is no active suicidal ideation, plan, or tendency to act out.
   - There is no mention of a past *actual* suicide attempt.
   - The category ""indicator"" states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This fits perfectly, as the post explicitly states a *resolved* (or at least postponed) suicidal issue.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I'm going to kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with extreme self-deprecating language, expressing feelings of worthlessness, failure, disappointment, and self-loathing (""disappointment,"" ""no fucking talent,"" ""useless bitch,"" ""failing miserably,"" ""ideas are just shit,"" ""delusional,"" ""cunt,"" ""no value,"" ""worst of all human beings,"" ""fuck hole""). This indicates severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There are no specific plans, methods (e.g., tool, location, substance), or signs of preparation mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts or self-harm.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm going to kill myself"").
    *   However, it does not detail any specific plan (how, when, where) or method for committing suicide.
    *   It does not mention any historical experience of self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   Based on the definitions: ""ideation"" is defined as ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This perfectly matches the analysis.

457,My landlord called for the smell of a Dead Body. My landlord is clearly trying to get me out of my apartment. My neighbors have been purposely keeping me awake.

No smell was found by the cops. I'm so tired. My heads messing with me. I just wanna leave this place. I got diagnosed with MS recently it's hard to deal. I just know I'm gonna be wakened if I fall asleep. It never fails. I cant take this torture from these people. I want to leave. I have no money to just walk out or i would. I dont know what options I have left. I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of suicide or self-harm. There is a mention of a ""Dead Body smell"" but it refers to a situation involving the landlord/neighbors, not the user's own state.
   - Note emotional indicators: ""I'm so tired,"" ""My heads messing with me,"" ""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""it's hard to deal,"" ""I cant take this torture from these people,"" ""I want to leave,"" ""I have no money to just walk out,"" ""I dont know what options I have left,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs."" These indicate extreme exhaustion, distress, paranoia, feeling trapped, and hopelessness regarding their current living situation.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a strong desire to ""leave this place"" and ""walk out,"" which refers to their apartment/living situation, not an explicit desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current distress and desire to escape a difficult living situation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress, exhaustion, and a feeling of being trapped and persecuted. The user is clearly suffering.
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any form of self-harm. The desire to ""leave"" is directed at their physical location/situation, not life itself.
   - There are no plans, methods, or historical attempts mentioned.
   - Based on the definitions, 'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression, 'behavior' requires a plan/tendency to act or historical self-harm, and 'attempt' requires recent or historical suicide attempts. This post does not meet the criteria for these categories as it lacks explicit suicidal intent or action.
   - The 'indicator' category states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This post fits the ""no explicit suicidal expression"" part, despite the high level of distress.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Possible suicide date is in July."" ""debating it"" (implies suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: ""My parents don't love me,"" ""I have nobody :),"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope',"" ""I don't even know who I am anymore."" (Indicates hopelessness, isolation, gender identity distress, self-worth issues).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Possible suicide date is in July"" (This is a temporal plan, not a method or specific preparation like acquiring means).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""Possible suicide date is in July"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly through the mention of a ""possible suicide date"" and ""debating it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of a ""Possible suicide date"" indicates a temporal plan or intention, which is a sign of a tendency to act, even if the method is not specified.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Possible suicide date is in July,"" ""debating it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Possible suicide date is in July"").
   - The mention of a ""Possible suicide date"" indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide,"" even if the method is not specified and the individual is ""debating it."" This goes beyond mere ideation (which states ""no plan or tendency""). It's a concrete (though not finalized) temporal plan.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category as it describes explicit suicidal expression with a plan or tendency to act out.

It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""makes me suicidal"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""never kill myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""sad"", ""hurts so much"", ""loser"", ""never make friends"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""makes me suicidal"", ""have suicidal thoughts"". However, this is immediately followed by a negation of action: ""I will probably never kill myself"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current feelings and thoughts (""immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts""). The intention to act is explicitly negated for the future (""will probably never kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly states ""have suicidal thoughts"" and ""makes me suicidal"", which is explicit suicidal expression. This rules out the first part of the 'indicator' definition (""no explicit suicidal expression"").
    *   There is no mention of a plan or tendency to act (""I will probably never kill myself""). This rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts, combined with the absence of a plan or tendency to commit suicide, aligns directly with the definition of 'ideation'.
    *   While the post mentions a reason for *not* acting (""religious person... big sin""), which could be interpreted as a ""resolved suicidal issue"" in terms of action, the suicidal *thoughts* themselves are explicitly stated as current and ongoing (""I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts""). Therefore, the core issue of ideation is present, even if there's a strong protective factor against acting. The category 'ideation' specifically covers explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency, which fits this post best.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ending it all"", ""suicide notes"", ""suicide"" (implied by notes).
   - Emotional indicators: ""awful year"", ""lonely bastard"", ""fucked it up"", ""fucking idiot"", ""no one wanted to be friends with me anymore"", ""tired of failing everyone"", ""can't fucking do another year"". These show extreme despair, hopelessness, self-blame, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" (specific time/date), ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"" (specific preparation/means).
   - References to past attempts: Mentions ""made 3 other suicide notes this year"", which indicates past preparations/intentions, not necessarily past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide notes"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""thinking of ending it all"", ""can't fucking do another year"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? A specific time (""new year's eve"") is mentioned as the intended time.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""this is the one"" suicide note indicates active preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"", ""this is the one"" note). It also references past preparations (""made 3 other suicide notes this year"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, past *preparations* (notes) are described, not past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""ending it all"", ""suicide notes"").
   - It includes a specific temporal plan (""on new year's eve"").
   - It indicates active preparation (""this is the one"" suicide note).
   - The mention of past suicide notes reinforces a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - This clearly fits the ""behavior"" category, which requires explicit suicidal expression and a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. It does not describe a completed attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""tried to cut myself"" (explicit mention of self-harm).
   - Emotional indicators: ""breakdown"", ""very bad night"", ""kind of drunk"", ""wanted to feel something real"" (indicates distress and a coping mechanism).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cut myself"" (method implied). No explicit preparation mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""tried to cut myself last night"" (describes a recent past incident of self-harm). ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" provides context that this was a first-time incident.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post mentions self-harm (""cut myself"") but not suicide directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The motivation given is ""wanted to feel something real"", not a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut myself"" implies a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned, only the act itself.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event: ""tried to cut myself last night"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a past *self-harm* incident is described. The post does not explicitly state it was a *suicide* attempt, but rather an act of self-harm.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Not applicable, as there is explicit self-harm mentioned.
   - 'ideation': Not applicable, as an action (self-harm) was taken, not just thoughts.
   - 'behavior': This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*."" The post explicitly describes ""tried to cut myself last night"", which is a clear ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"". The motivation ""wanted to feel something real"" aligns with self-harm as a coping mechanism rather than a direct intent to die.
   - 'attempt': This category refers to ""recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" While cutting can be part of a suicide attempt, the post's phrasing (""tried to cut myself"" and ""wanted to feel something real"") does not explicitly state it was an attempt to *end life*. It aligns more directly with self-harm behavior.

Based on the explicit mention of a ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" without explicitly stating suicidal intent for that act, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""lost feelings for me"", ""became toxic"", ""nothing and no one"", ""no purpose to live"" (hopelessness, despair, self-blame, isolation).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""plan to kill myself"", indicating a decision or intention to act, but no specific method or detailed preparation is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""plan to kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The phrase ""plan to kill myself"" indicates a clear intention or decision to act, which aligns with having a ""plan or tendency to act out"" as per the 'behavior' category definition, even if the specific method is not detailed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""plan to kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""plan to kill myself"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) by stating a ""plan to kill myself,"" which signifies a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" as described in the 'behavior' category. While a specific method is not detailed, the explicit statement of a plan to commit suicide moves it beyond just having thoughts.
   - It does not mention a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - It is more than just resolved issues or no explicit expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It is more than just explicit expression without a plan or tendency, ruling out 'ideation', because ""plan to kill myself"" *is* a statement of a plan/tendency.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing yourself soon"", ""killing yourself"", ""being stopped"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""no worries of being stopped"" (indicates resolve and lack of desire for intervention).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method is mentioned. However, ""killing yourself soon"" implies a definite intention and imminence. The question about informing others suggests preparation for the act's aftermath.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""killing yourself soon"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the entire post is predicated on the user's intention to die by suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""killing yourself soon"" indicates a strong intention and imminence, suggesting a plan is either formed or in the process of being formed. The discussion about *how* to inform others before the act implies a decision has been made and the act is anticipated. The statement ""no worries of being stopped"" further reinforces a determined intent to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""killing yourself soon"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing yourself soon"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation because it expresses a clear intention and imminence (""soon""). The discussion about informing others *before* the act, and the statement ""no worries of being stopped,"" strongly indicate a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" and suggest a plan is in place, even if the specific method isn't detailed. This fits the definition of 'behavior' more accurately than 'ideation', which implies no plan or tendency to commit suicide.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""hang myself""
   - Emotional indicators: ""Fuckkkkkkk"", ""so fucking tired of everything"", ""god damn it"", ""want to kill myself so bad"" (indicates extreme distress, hopelessness, and strong desire for suicide)

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""so i dont kill myself"" and ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""This life doesnt fit me. It never did"", ""i dont like this shithole i live in but i cant change it."" (indicates hopelessness, despair, feeling trapped, lack of fit with life).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The act of ""sleep[ing] all day"" is described as a *preventative* measure against suicide, not a preparation for it.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to past attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""so i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death."").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""This life doesnt fit me. It never did"" combined with the explicit mentions of suicide and the need to sleep to avoid it, strongly implies a desire not to be alive in their current circumstances.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The action described (sleeping all day) is a coping mechanism to *avoid* suicide, not a preparation for it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current struggles and ongoing suicidal ideation (""i have to so i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""so i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, nor any historical experience of self-harm or suicide attempts. This rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.
    *   The phrase ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" indicates that suicidal thoughts are present and strong enough to influence daily behavior (sleeping all day as a coping mechanism). However, this is a measure taken to *prevent* acting on the thoughts, not a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" The questioning of suicide's perceived badness also points to active contemplation.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" The ""tendency to commit suicide"" here refers to the presence and strength of the suicidal thoughts, not concrete steps towards acting out.

467,I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it. Thats it I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it simple as that,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die"" is explicitly stated twice.
   - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, self-perception of cowardice (""too much of a coward to do it"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention/feeling (""I want to die"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die"").
   - However, it explicitly states ""I'm too much of a coward to do it,"" which indicates a lack of immediate plan or tendency to act on the suicidal thoughts.
   - This fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" It does not fit 'behavior' because there's no plan or tendency to act, nor historical self-harm. It's not 'attempt' as no attempt is mentioned. It's not 'indicator' as there is explicit suicidal expression that is not resolved.

But now i am at peace, no longer in pain, locked in the bathroom while my friends text me endlessly about how im ""ignoring"" them, but in reality i dont have the confidence to even say a word to them knowing it might as well be my last. Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Goodbye"", ""throw myself off a bridge"", ""my last vent"", ""dying"", ""suicidal since i was 9"", ""self-harmed"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it"", ""hated myself"", ""tired of everything around me"", ""at peace, no longer in pain"" (this often indicates a decision has been made).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""throw myself off a bridge"", ""Ive planned it all out"", ""locked in the bathroom"".
   - References to past attempts: ""suicidal since i was 9"", ""self-harmed"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. (""throw myself off a bridge"", ""suicidal"", ""dying"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. (""Goodbye"", ""throw myself off a bridge"", ""I cant take it"", ""i fifnt want to be here"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""throw myself off a bridge"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Ive planned it all out"", ""locked in the bathroom"", ""Goodbye"" (as a farewell).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. ""suicidal since i was 9"", ""self-harmed"" refer to past experiences. ""This is probably going to become a throw-away account, possibly my last vent before i littitimatly decide to throw myself off a bridge"", ""Ive planned it all out"", ""locked in the bathroom"" refer to current and imminent future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? ""self-harmed"" is mentioned as a past behavior.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""throw myself off a bridge"", ""dying""). It clearly outlines a specific plan or method (""throw myself off a bridge"") and indicates preparation and intent (""Ive planned it all out"", ""locked in the bathroom"", ""Goodbye""). It also mentions historical self-harm behavior. This combination of explicit expression, a clear plan, and tendency to act, along with historical self-harm, aligns directly with the definition of 'behavior'. It is not merely ideation because a plan is present and imminent action is implied. It is not an attempt as it describes future action, not a past or ongoing attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm gonna commit suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""die of blood loss.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""twist my dick off"" and ""die of blood loss"" are described as the means and outcome.
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""I'm gonna wait it off"" suggests a commitment to the method and allowing it to lead to death. ""I sure am gonna try here"" indicates an immediate intention to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm gonna..."", ""I sure am gonna try here"", ""I'm gonna wait it off"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm gonna commit suicide"", ""die of blood loss""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - It clearly describes a specific method (""twist my dick off"", ""die of blood loss"") and expresses a strong intention/tendency to act (""I sure am gonna try here"", ""I'm gonna wait it off""). This goes beyond mere ideation.
   - There is no mention of a past or recent suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'behavior' category, as it has explicit suicidal expression and a plan/tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.

For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis.

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""how to die"", ""definitely die"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to definitely die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned, but the user is explicitly seeking information on ""how to die"", which is a clear step towards identifying or acquiring a method.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
   - 'ideation': While there is explicit suicidal expression, the phrase ""Where can I find out how to die"" goes beyond mere ideation. It indicates an active search for a method, which signifies a ""tendency to act out"".
   - 'behavior': This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The post clearly has explicit suicidal expression (""I just want to definitely die""). The question ""Where can I find out how to die"" demonstrates a strong ""tendency to act out"" by seeking means or knowledge for a plan. It's not just a thought, but a step towards action.
   - 'attempt': Not applicable, as no recent or historical attempt is mentioned.

Based on the active seeking of information on ""how to die"", which implies a clear tendency to act, the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate fit.

   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""don't see a future for myself, I just don't really want one either""), exhaustion (""tired of buying time"", ""tired of fighting to heal""), despair (""constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation""), apathy (""Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore"", ""I just don't care"").

This indicates a future plan with a high degree of intent and perceived certainty of success, even if the specific method is not detailed.
   - References to past attempts: ""if I do attempt again"" explicitly states a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""will to die"", ""If I do it"", ""if I do attempt again"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""not because I want to be alive"", ""I just don't really want one either"", ""will to die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""if I do attempt again"" clearly describes a historical experience of a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression and a clear future intention/plan.
   - Crucially, it explicitly mentions a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" with the phrase ""if I do attempt again"".
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'indicator' is incorrect due to explicit suicidal expression and past attempt.
     - 'ideation' is incorrect because there is a plan/tendency and a past attempt.
     - 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While it has a plan/tendency, the historical experience is specifically a *suicide attempt*, not just self-harm.
     - 'attempt' states: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This definition perfectly matches the explicit mention of a past suicide attempt (""if I do attempt again"").

Therefore, the most fitting category is 'attempt' due to the explicit mention of a historical suicide attempt.

This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge. Can't sleep. No future.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""Another day of being mute,"" ""Everyday is the same,"" ""Nothing to say ever,"" ""No future,"" ""Can't sleep."" (indicates hopelessness, despair, lack of purpose)
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Bridge."" (specific method/location)
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday."")
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""No future."")

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Bridge.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday"" combined with a specific method (""Bridge"") indicates a clear intention and a plan with a timeframe.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""on Monday"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself""), a specific plan/method (""Bridge""), and a clear intention with a timeframe (""on Monday""). This aligns with the 'behavior' category which states ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". It is not merely ideation as a plan is present, and it is not an attempt as it refers to a future action.

Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it. And it's just can't get this girl out of my head. Good fore to stay away though. Not cool to start something and then  just kms. Gah but it's so hard. One of the hardest decisions I've taken iny life. Wish I have more sex before I go though lol. Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""hangman's noose"", ""kms"" (kill myself) mentioned multiple times, ""when I do it"", ""before I go"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Gah but it's so hard"", ""One of the hardest decisions I've taken in my life"", ""Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too"". These indicate significant distress and internal struggle.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track"" suggests a chosen method (hanging) and a commitment/reminder to a plan. ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms. Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it."" This indicates a significant obstacle to suicide has been removed, implying preparation or a solidified intention to act. The phrase ""when I do it"" suggests a decision has been made.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts. ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" refers to overcoming an obstacle *to* committing suicide, not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kms"" (kill myself) is used multiple times, along with phrases like ""when I do it"" and ""before I go"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""kms"" is a direct expression of wanting to die by suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hangman's noose"" implies hanging as a method, and it's used as a tool ""to stay on track.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, setting the wallpaper as a constant reminder (""to stay on track"") is a form of psychological preparation/commitment. Overcoming a ""big hurdle"" to ""kms"" and ensuring the mother's financial security (""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"") are significant steps indicating preparation and a clear intention to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""when I do it"", ""before I go"", ""to stay on track""). ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" refers to a recent past event that clears the way for a future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kms"", ""when I do it""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""hangman's noose"" as a reminder/motivator) and, crucially, by stating that a significant obstacle to suicide has been overcome (""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms. Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it.""). This indicates a clear tendency to act out or a plan being put into motion, rather than just thoughts. The phrase ""when I do it"" implies a decision has been made.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal expression combined with signs of preparation and a clear tendency/plan to act (overcoming hurdles, setting reminders, implying a decision has been made) aligns best with the 'behavior' category.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me.

        *   Current: ""Today, I have an exit bag set up."" ""When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked."" This describes a very recent action that was part of a suicide attempt, even if it was interrupted. The user states ""I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time,"" indicating a current state of being on the verge of, or having just been on the verge of, an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It describes multiple detailed past suicide attempts (aspirin, gun, rope). This directly matches ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"" in the 'attempt' category.
    *   It also describes a very recent action (""Today, I have an exit bag set up... When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked... I turned off the gas"") which constitutes a ""recent suicide attempt,"" even if interrupted.
    *   The 'behavior' category includes ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour,"" which could encompass attempts, but the 'attempt' category specifically and more accurately captures the nature of the described events as ""suicide attempts."" Given the clear descriptions of both historical and recent attempts, 'attempt' is the most precise classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""face death"", ""until i die"", ""if not, well, you know what happened"" (implying death by self-inflicted means).
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm done"", ""I'm too pissed"", ""don't even want to feel good anymore"", ""embrace the pain"". These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and a desire to end suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""gonna start working out until i die or pass out"". This is a stated method and intent to cause self-harm leading to death or unconsciousness.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, the intent to die by one's own actions is clearly expressed (""face death"", ""until i die"", ""if not, well, you know what happened"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""don't even want to feel good anymore, just gonna embrace the pain and face death"", ""working out until i die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""working out until i die or pass out"". This is a specific, albeit unconventional, method of self-harm/suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I'm now gonna start working out"" indicates an immediate intention to act on this plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. ""I'm now gonna start working out"", ""I'll be back in 12 hours if i survived"". This describes an immediate, intended action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""face death"", ""until i die"").
   - It also describes a specific plan/tendency to act out self-harm/suicide (""gonna start working out until i die or pass out""). The phrase ""if not, well, you know what happened"" reinforces the lethal intent of this action.
   - It is not merely ideation because a specific action with a lethal intent is described.
   - It is not an attempt because it describes an *imminent* action, not a completed or past one.
   - It is not an indicator as there is clear explicit suicidal expression and a plan.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category as it involves explicit suicidal expression and a stated plan/tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I have contemplated suicide for years,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" and ""plan to be dead long before I retire.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses a long-standing internal struggle and a practical dilemma arising from the certainty of future suicide.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned. There are no signs of immediate preparation. The ""plan"" discussed is about the *timing* (""maybe in my 20's or 30's"") rather than the *how*.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past suicide attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes. ""contemplated suicide,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, the core premise is the certainty of future death by suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No immediate preparation for suicide is mentioned. The preparation discussed (retirement plan) is a financial dilemma *caused* by the future intention of suicide, not a preparation for it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to a long-standing contemplation (""for years"") and a firm future intention (""I know I am going to do it,"" ""maybe in my 20's or 30's"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression that is not resolved.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression, the definition for 'ideation' states ""there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This post clearly expresses a strong *tendency* and certainty (""I know I am going to do it"") regarding future suicide, even if the immediate plan is absent.
    *   **behavior:** This category requires ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post contains explicit suicidal expression. The statement ""I know I am going to do it"" and the long-term contemplation (""for years"") strongly indicate a *tendency to act out* suicide in the future, even if the exact timing and method are not yet fixed. This goes beyond mere fleeting thoughts; it's a deeply held conviction about future action. No historical self-harm is mentioned.
    *   **attempt:** Not applicable, as no recent or historical suicide attempt is mentioned.

Based on the strong stated certainty and long-term contemplation of future suicide (""I know I am going to do it""), the post indicates a clear ""tendency to act out"" in the future, fitting the 'behavior' category more accurately than 'ideation' which specifies ""no plan or tendency.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, but ""I just want to end"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I just want to end but haven't yet"" refers to a current desire/intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the phrase ""haven't yet"" indicates no past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I just want to end"") but lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act out. It also explicitly states no past attempt (""haven't yet""). This aligns with the definition of 'ideation'.

489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""dead by the end of the day today"", ""off myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired"", ""fatigue"", ""distracts from life"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""go buy the gas"" is mentioned as a necessary step for a potential method, indicating a considered means, even if currently unacted upon due to fatigue.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""dead by the end of the day today"", ""off myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I could be dead by the end of the day today"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""go buy the gas"" implies a specific method involving gas (e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning, self-immolation).
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post explicitly states the *lack* of preparation (""never leave the house to go buy the gas"") due to fatigue, but the *idea* of acquiring the means is present, indicating a *tendency* towards a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I could be dead by the end of the day today"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""dead by the end of the day today"", ""off myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific means (""gas"") and the necessary step to acquire it (""go buy the gas""). While the action is currently inhibited by fatigue, the consideration of a method and the means to execute it constitutes a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" This moves it beyond 'ideation' which states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"".
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the best fit as it includes explicit suicidal expression and a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through the consideration of a specific method and means, even if currently unfulfilled.

490,"I should stop being a pussy and do it. I post about suicide constantly, I should just suck it up and do it already.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""do it"" (referring to suicide), ""suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: Frustration, self-deprecation (""pussy""), a sense of urgency or resignation towards acting on suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None. It mentions ""I post about suicide constantly,"" which refers to past expressions of ideation, not attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I post about suicide constantly"" and ""do it"" clearly refers to suicide in this context.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" implies a desire to end life and a push towards action.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I should... do it already"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I should just suck it up and do it already"").
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.
   - However, the phrases ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" indicate a strong *tendency to act out* suicide. It's not merely expressing thoughts of suicide (ideation), but expressing a desire to overcome internal barriers and *perform* the act. This aligns with the ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" part of the 'behavior' definition.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>

   - References to past attempts: The post mentions a past plan to kill self (""planned to kill myself in the forest in January"") but explicitly states ""But I didn't"". It also mentions past self-harm (""started to cut my rights leg... it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself"").

Everything is ready"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? A past *plan* was described, but it explicitly states ""But I didn't"", indicating it was not an attempt. Past self-harm is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression. It details a specific plan and method for suicide, along with preparations (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""), indicating a strong tendency to act out. Furthermore, it explicitly mentions historical self-harm behavior (""started to cut my rights leg... it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself""). This aligns perfectly with the 'behavior' category definition: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" It does not fit 'attempt' because the past suicide plan was explicitly stated as not acted upon, and the current plan is a future intention, not a recent or historical attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"", ""I wish I was never born"", ""don't really want to die"", ""no point for us being here"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, existential questioning (""dumbest shit ever"", ""no point"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I wish I was never born"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"" questions the value of life, leading to a desire for non-existence. However, this is immediately followed by ""but at the same time don't really want to die,"" indicating ambivalence.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of a desire not to be alive (""I wish I was never born"") and questions the fundamental value of life (""What's the point of living... no point for us being here""). These are forms of suicidal expression or ideation.
    *   Crucially, the post states, ""but at the same time don't really want to die."" This indicates that while there are suicidal thoughts or wishes for non-existence, there is no active desire or tendency to commit suicide.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or any past self-harm/suicide behavior or attempt.
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   'indicator' is too low because there *is* explicit suicidal expression (wishing not to be born, questioning life's point).
        *   'behavior' and 'attempt' are too high because there is no plan, tendency to act, or historical behavior/attempt mentioned.
        *   'ideation' fits perfectly: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" The ambivalence (""don't really want to die"") confirms the lack of a tendency to act, while the other phrases confirm the presence of suicidal thoughts/expressions.

   - Emotional indicators: ""lonely"", ""Nobody cares ever"", ""Im such a spoiled piece of shit"" (despair, self-loathing, feelings of abandonment).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods or preparations are mentioned. ""before the day"" indicates a temporal urgency but not a method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""im going to do it"" directly implies suicidal action. ""pls fucking end me"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""im going to do it"", ""pls fucking end me"").
   - There is no specific plan or method identified.
   - However, the phrase ""im going to do it"" indicates a clear *tendency to act out self-harm or suicide*, even without a detailed plan. The phrase ""pls fucking end me before the day"" also expresses a strong desire for immediate action.
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'ideation' is ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
     - 'behavior' is ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
   - Since there is an explicit expression of a *tendency* to act (""im going to do it""), it fits the 'behavior' category more accurately than 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I hope it'll be me next"" (implying death by stabbing), ""suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: Implied despair, desire to avoid shame.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No active plan to commit suicide. The method mentioned (""stabbing"") is something the user *hopes* happens to them, not something they plan to inflict upon themselves. There are no signs of preparation.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hope it'll be me next"" (expressing a desire for death).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""stabbing"" as a desired *means of death*, but not a self-inflicted method. The user is hoping for an external event, not planning an action.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I hope it'll be me next"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I hope it'll be me next"", ""with a suicide""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post does not describe a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on the presence of a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". While the user expresses a desire for death and a preferred *type* of death (being stabbed to avoid the shame of suicide), they are not describing an active plan or a tendency to *act out* self-harm or suicide themselves. They are hoping for an external event to cause their death, rather than planning to commit suicide. Therefore, it fits the description of 'ideation' where there is explicit suicidal expression but no plan or tendency to commit suicide.

While no specific *suicide method* (e.g., specific tool or substance) is mentioned, there is a clear *plan* to create the circumstances for suicide by disappearing and obtaining a new identity to avoid family intervention. This is a preparation to facilitate the act.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user is actively seeking a plan to ""disappear"" and ""go to another country have another identinty"" specifically ""so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it?"". This indicates a clear intention to prepare the circumstances for suicide by removing obstacles (family) and seeking a private environment. This constitutes a ""plan or tendency to act out"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""how to run..."", ""i want to put an end..."", ""how can i just disappear?"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all"").
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by discussing a *plan* or *tendency to act out* by seeking ways to disappear and create a specific environment to commit suicide without interference. The user is actively asking ""how to"" achieve this disappearance for the purpose of suicide. This aligns with ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   The category 'attempt' is defined as: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
