0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off."" Both are clear mentions of suicide/death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" indicates a current, ongoing thought process. ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" indicates a current desire/intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific method (""jump off"") and a specific location (""a bridge""). This constitutes a plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""ending my life again"" implies past thoughts or perhaps past attempts, but the post does not describe a *completed* past action (e.g., ""I tried to jump off a bridge last week""). It describes a current thought and desire.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes.
    *   Plan/method/preparation mentioned: Yes (""go to a bridge and jump off"").
    *   This combination aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR. It's not ATTEMPT because no completed past action is described. It's not IDEATION because a specific method/plan is present.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not described.
*   Past vs. Present: The post describes current thoughts and a current desired action/plan. ""Again"" refers to the recurrence of the *thought*, not necessarily a past *completed action*.
*   When in Doubt: Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because a method/plan is mentioned. Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT, choose BEHAVIOR as no completed past action is described.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" explicitly expresses a wish to die or an impending death, especially in the context of ""I'm inconsolable."" This aligns with Critical Classification Rule 1: ""Phrases like 'I'm going to die soon' or 'I want to be gone' ARE explicit expressions of death wishes when in context of distress.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""soon"" indicates a potential future timing. ""going to"" indicates an impending state.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** There are explicit suicide/death wishes (""I'm going to die soon""). However, there is NO plan, method, or preparation mentioned. Therefore, according to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.
    *   Critical Rule: ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention."" - Applies here, as ""I'm going to die soon"" is explicit.
    *   Critical Rule: ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose IDEATION if NO method/plan mentioned."" - Applies here, as no method/plan is mentioned.

This post explicitly states a desire for death (""I'm going to die soon"") but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""I hate living."" - Expresses distress and dissatisfaction with life.
    *   ""sometime i think about why i have to live until now"" - This phrase, especially in context of ""I hate living,"" questions the necessity of continued existence and implies a desire not to be alive or for life to end. While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" it is a strong expression of not wanting to continue living, which falls under the umbrella of ""not wanting to be alive"" or a death wish as per the critical rules (e.g., ""I want to be gone"" is explicit).

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""sometime i think about"" - Indicates ongoing thoughts, not immediate urgency or past action. This is general/ongoing.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are described.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains an explicit expression of not wanting to continue living (""why i have to live until now"" in the context of ""I hate living"" implies ""I don't want to be alive"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive""). This moves it beyond a general ""INDICATOR"" of distress.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not qualify as ""BEHAVIOR.""
    *   There is no description of a past completed action, so it is not ""ATTEMPT.""
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of ""IDEATION"": ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" The phrase ""why i have to live until now"" strongly conveys ""I don't want to be alive.""

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""Help me kill myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Help me"" and ""Please somebody help me find"" indicate current and immediate intent/action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user explicitly asks for help finding ""trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,"" which are specific methods. This indicates a clear plan and seeking of means.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a current desire and seeking of means, not a past completed attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""Help me kill myself"") AND a specific method being sought (""barbiturates/Nembutal""). According to the framework, this falls under BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit.
*   Intrusive Thoughts: Not applicable.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable.
*   Past vs. Present: Present intent and seeking.
*   When in Doubt: This is clearly beyond IDEATION due to the specific method being sought. It is not ATTEMPT as no past completed action is described.

I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly asks ""Is there a painless way to die"" and states ""I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language is current (""Is there..."", ""I want..."").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""Is there a painless way to die"" is a direct inquiry about methods and ways to die. This falls under ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" which is a criterion for BEHAVIOR. The follow-up ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain"" reinforces this search for a method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   The post goes beyond just wishing to die by actively inquiring about methods (""Is there a painless way to die""). This constitutes ""seeking information about suicide methods,"" which is a criterion for BEHAVIOR.
    *   There are no past completed attempts described, so it's not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, based on the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts and the act of seeking information about suicide methods, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

5,"whats the point of living. no really. is there any real reason to keep going that cant just be dismissed by ""none of it will matter when you're dead"". all the things that made me want to kill myself are solved and yet i still want to die because now im just left with the feeling that life is all pointless. for a year straight i was constantly thinking about how nothing matters after you die and how life doesnt really matter and even though nothing in particular in my life is making me want to die anymore i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways. but seriously why shouldnt we just kill ourselves if none of this matters and we wont remember anything at all after we're dead. this all just seems like a huge waste of time.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""none of it will matter when you're dead"", ""want to kill myself"", ""want to die"", ""nothing matters after you die"", ""should do it anyways"" (referring to killing self), and ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"". These are clear and explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes an ongoing and current state: ""i still want to die"", ""i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways"", ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"". It also references a past period of constant thinking (""for a year straight i was constantly thinking""), but the core feeling is present and ongoing.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations (e.g., bridge), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods. The question ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"" is philosophical, not a request for methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts (completed actions) or interrupted attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (Step 1 is true).
    *   No plan/method is mentioned (Step 3 is false).
    *   No past completed action is mentioned (Step 4 is false).
    *   Therefore, this fits the ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"" rule.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases are explicit (""want to kill myself"", ""want to die"").
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The post indicates a persistent feeling/thought about ending life, even if the external stressors are gone, which aligns with explicit ideation.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** Focus is on current, ongoing feelings.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit mentions. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION due to lack of plan/method.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to die and mentions suicide explicitly, but without any specific plan or method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit mentions of wanting to die/not be alive: ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it,"" and ""I want it to be over tonight.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tonight"" indicates immediate urgency. ""I want to"" indicates current desire.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post explicitly expresses suicide thoughts (""want to be gone,"" ""don't wanna survive"") but does not include any specific plans, methods, or preparations.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I just wanna die."" This clearly indicates a wish to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The desire is expressed in the present tense (""I just wanna die""). No specific immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned, but the feeling is current.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations, or research about suicide methods.

*   There is no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.
*   It's more than just general distress; it's an explicit death wish, so it's not INDICATOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself"". This is a direct mention of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""keeps telling me"", ""sometimes"" - indicates an ongoing, general state, not immediate urgency.

Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant if there was a button i could press that would erase all traces of my existence i wouldnt even doubt it, id go for it. But these things dont exist, so either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids. i dont know, i wouldnt know, im damaged",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""All i know is that i want to call it a day and kill myself"" and ""Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant"". It also mentions ""if there was a button i could press that would erase all traces of my existence"". These are clear expressions of wanting to die or end life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""want to die now, right now in this instant"" indicate immediate urgency. The desire to ""call it a day and kill myself"" is a current desire.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions specific methods: ""either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids."" These are concrete plans/methods of how the person might act on their suicidal thoughts. ""Run towards a cop with a knife"" is a specific action plan. ""Find a dealer with some opioids"" describes acquiring means.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes current thoughts, desires, and potential future actions. It does *not* describe a past completed suicide attempt. It discusses a prolonged state of distress (""falling down this void for like 5 or 6 years"") but not a past attempt to end life.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""kill myself"", ""want to die""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   Specific plans/methods are mentioned (""run towards a cop with a knife"", ""find a dealer with some opioids""). This rules out IDEATION.
    *   The post describes current thoughts and potential future actions, not a completed past action. This rules out ATTEMPT.
    *   Since there are explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I want to die now"", ""kill myself"" are explicit.
*   The methods described (""knife"", ""opioids"") are specific.
*   No past completed attempt is described, only current thoughts and potential future actions.

Therefore, the post fits the definition of BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""I just want to get it over with."" - In the context of severe distress and deterioration, this explicitly conveys a desire to end life.
    *   ""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it."" - ""Go through with it"" clearly refers to acting on suicidal thoughts, indicating an explicit contemplation of suicide.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""I just want to get it over with."" - Current desire.
    *   ""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it."" - Current contemplation.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping,"" ""hanging"") is mentioned.
    *   No specific location is mentioned.
    *   No preparations (e.g., ""writing notes,"" ""acquiring means"") are described.
    *   The phrase ""How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last"" indicates fear and contemplation of the *experience* of dying, but it does not constitute a specific plan, method, or research *about* methods. It's a barrier to action, not a description of the action itself.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No past attempts are mentioned.
    *   No interrupted attempts are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of wanting to end life (""get it over with,"" ""go through with it""), so it is not **INDICATOR**.
    *   There are no descriptions of past completed suicide attempts, so it is not **ATTEMPT**.
    *   The choice is between **IDEATION** and **BEHAVIOR**.
    *   **IDEATION** is defined as ""explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""
    *   **BEHAVIOR** requires ""explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods.""
    *   While the user is clearly contemplating suicide, the post *lacks* any specific plan, method, or preparation. The fear of pain and duration is a reflection on the *consequences* of an unstated action, not a description of the action itself or how it would be carried out. It does not meet the criteria for ""specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods.""
    *   Therefore, it best fits the definition of **IDEATION**.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""get it over with"" and ""go through with it"" are explicit.
*   ""Intrusive Thoughts"": Not applicable here.
*   ""Interrupted Actions"": Not applicable here.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": Focus is on present contemplation.
*   ""When in Doubt"": Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR *if ANY method/plan mentioned*. No specific method/plan is mentioned.

Based on the strict definitions, the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation places this post in the IDEATION category.

I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is a strong metaphorical expression of wanting to escape one's own existence or consciousness. In the context of deep distress and self-blame, this aligns with ""not wanting to be alive"" or ""wanting to be gone,"" as specified in the ""Explicit vs. Implicit"" rule. It expresses a wish to cease being who they are, which is a form of death wish or desire to not exist.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes an ongoing pattern of thought and feeling (""I always think,"" ""everyone leaves you eventually,"" ""It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.""). There are no immediate or urgent timing indicators.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging), locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to escape oneself/one's existence (""I'd leave myself if I could""), which counts as an explicit death wish or not wanting to be alive.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned.
    *   According to the rules, if there are explicit suicide thoughts but no plan/method, it is IDEATION. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" goes beyond general distress (INDICATOR) and explicitly expresses a desire to cease to be oneself, fitting the IDEATION criteria of ""I don't want to be alive"" or ""I wish I was dead"" in a metaphorical sense.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is interpreted as an explicit expression of a death wish or desire to not exist, similar to ""I want to be gone,"" given the context of severe emotional pain and self-rejection.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, I choose IDEATION because the phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is more than just general distress; it's a direct expression of wanting to escape one's own existence, which is a form of suicidal ideation.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""i plan to kill myself at 21"". This is a clear and direct mention of suicide. Other phrases like ""i don't know what to do"", ""it's not fixable, there is no hope"", ""this is hell"" indicate severe distress and hopelessness, supporting the suicidal intent.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The timing is specified as ""at 21"" (the user is currently 18). This indicates a future-oriented, but definite, plan.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""i plan to kill myself at 21"". This constitutes a ""specific plan"" due to the stated intention and the specific timing (at age 21). While a method (e.g., pills, jumping) is not mentioned, the *plan itself* with a specific future date/age is a defining characteristic of the BEHAVIOR category. The prompt states BEHAVIOR includes ""specific plans"".

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Not INDICATOR because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Not IDEATION because there is an explicit *plan* (""i plan to kill myself at 21""), not just a wish or thought.
    *   It fits BEHAVIOR because there are explicit suicidal thoughts (""i plan to kill myself"") AND a specific plan (to do it at age 21).
    *   Not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""i plan to kill myself at 21"" is explicit.
*   The plan to commit suicide at a specific age (21) is a ""specific plan"" as per the BEHAVIOR definition, even without a method.
*   No past attempts are mentioned.

Therefore, the presence of a specific plan (timing) for suicide places it in the BEHAVIOR category.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die."" and later ""I am not going to kill myself"". The phrase ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence"" also strongly implies a desire not to be alive. Even though the person says they are not going to act ""any time soon"", the explicit mention of ""want to die"" and ""kill myself"" means suicide content is present.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The desire (""I want to die"") is current. However, the statement ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case"" indicates a *lack* of immediate urgency for action, despite the persistent suicidal thoughts.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research about *suicide methods* are mentioned. The question ""Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?"" is about coping, not a suicide method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""I want to die"", ""kill myself""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, and there is NO plan/method. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   There are no specific plans/methods/preparations, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There are no past completed actions, so it's not ATTEMPT.

    The critical rule ""Even if someone says 'my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to,' this is still IDEATION because suicide is explicitly mentioned"" applies here. The user explicitly states ""I want to die"" and mentions ""kill myself"", even while deferring action. This confirms IDEATION.

14,"It just really bothers me…and I don't really have the guts to do it. I'm on placement at the moment for work, and once these 6 months are over, I do not know what I'm going to do with my life. I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I feel like the only way out is suicide."" It also mentions, ""I've considered hanging."" And ""I think I should just make my escape."" These are clear mentions of suicide and death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I feel like the only way out is suicide"" indicates a current feeling. ""I've considered hanging"" refers to a past consideration, but the immediate follow-up ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" indicates a current inability to act on that thought. The overall tone is current distress and ongoing thoughts.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly states, ""I've considered hanging."" This is a specific method. There are no mentions of specific locations, preparations (like notes or acquiring means), or active research/seeking information beyond just ""considered.""

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post states, ""I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it."" This clearly indicates that no action was taken or initiated. It is not a past attempt, nor an interrupted attempt where action was started.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""suicide"", ""make my escape"").
    *   A specific plan/method (""hanging"") is mentioned.
    *   No past completed action is described. The person explicitly states they ""can't seem to go through with it.""

    Based on the definitions:
    *   It's not INDICATOR because explicit suicide is mentioned.
    *   It's not IDEATION because a specific method (""hanging"") is mentioned.
    *   It fits **BEHAVIOR** because there are explicit suicidal thoughts (""only way out is suicide"") AND a specific method (""considered hanging"") has been identified, but no action was initiated or completed. The rule for BEHAVIOR states: ""Posts with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods."" ""Considered hanging"" falls under ""specific methods.""
    *   It's not ATTEMPT because no concrete action was taken or completed. The phrase ""can't seem to go through with it"" confirms this.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit suicide content is present.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable as the thoughts are presented as the user's own consideration.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The user states ""can't seem to go through with it,"" which means no action was initiated and then stopped. This is consideration without initiation.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The consideration of hanging is past, but the inability to act is present, and the overall suicidal ideation is current. The presence of a specific method (even if only considered) pushes it to BEHAVIOR.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, the mention of ""hanging"" (a specific method) pushes it to BEHAVIOR. Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, there is no completed action, so it remains BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i already know i'm going to kill myself"" and ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year,"" clearly indicating a desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""just a matter of when and how"" indicates a decided future action. ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"" sets a timeframe.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" is a concrete preparation for suicide. This indicates a specific step towards a plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""going to kill myself"") AND describes preparations (""suicidal notes ready""). According to the framework, explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation falls under BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""going to kill myself"" is explicit.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable here.
*   Past vs. Present: The post describes a decision and current preparation for a future action, not a past completed attempt.
*   When in Doubt: It's clearly not INDICATOR (explicit suicide mentioned). It's not IDEATION because there are specific preparations (notes). It's not ATTEMPT because no completed past action is described. Therefore, BEHAVIOR is the correct classification.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** I am looking for explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, not wanting to be alive, or phrases like ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" ""want it to be over.""
    *   The post expresses extreme self-dissatisfaction, body image issues, and a desire to ""be someone else.""
    *   ""i just wish i could press a button and be someone else"" - This expresses a desire for transformation or escape from current self, not explicitly a wish for death or non-existence. ""Be someone else"" implies existing as a different person, not ceasing to exist.
    *   No direct mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" ""dead,"" ""not alive,"" ""gone,"" ""over.""
    *   Conclusion: No explicit suicide/death content identified.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes ongoing feelings (""im sick of,"" ""im tired of,"" ""i feel,"" ""i hate""). No immediate urgency related to suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide are mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors (in the context of suicidal intent) are mentioned. The actions described (dying hair, makeup, new clothes, eating less/more) are attempts to change appearance, not self-harm with suicidal intent.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Since NO explicit suicide/death wishes were mentioned in Step 1, the classification should be INDICATOR.
    *   Cross-referencing with Critical Classification Rules: ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": The phrase ""I just want to be someone else"" is about identity change, not explicitly death. It does not fall under the examples of explicit death wishes like ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I want to be gone"" (when those are in context of distress leading to cessation of life).
    *   ""When in Doubt"": Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention. Since there is NO explicit death/suicide mention, it remains INDICATOR.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses severe distress, self-loathing, and a desire to escape current identity, but it *lacks any explicit mention of wanting to die or commit suicide*. Therefore, it fits the definition of INDICATOR.

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""kill themselves"" and ""hurt themselves,"" but these phrases are used in the context of discussing *other people* who post about suicide, not the author themselves. The author states, ""For anyone that posts that they are going to kill themselves..."" and ""In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves."" This is a commentary on others' behavior, not an expression of personal suicidal thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** No urgency or timing indicators related to the author's own state.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No plan or method is mentioned by the author for themselves.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm behaviors are mentioned by the author for themselves.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post does not contain any explicit suicide/death wishes or expressions of distress *from the author about themselves*. The content is a commentary on the actions and motivations of *other* social media users. According to the rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned,"" this post does not indicate personal suicide risk for the author. Since there are no explicit death wishes from the author, it cannot be Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt. It expresses no personal distress or hopelessness either, but since it's a general discussion about suicide, it's the closest to 'indicator' as it's not irrelevant to the topic but doesn't express personal risk.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned."" This rule is key. The author is discussing others.
*   ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"" applies because the author is not expressing personal suicide wishes.
*   The post is a general discussion *about* suicide posts, not an expression of the author's own distress or suicidal thoughts. While it doesn't fit the typical ""distress, hopelessness"" part of INDICATOR perfectly, it's the only category that applies when the post is about the *topic* of suicide but not a personal expression of risk. It's not ""NaN"" or empty, and it's one of the four options.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""Im so tired of being alive,"" and ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself."" It also mentions ""the past two times ive tried ive failed,"" which directly refers to suicide attempts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"" indicates current desire. ""the past two times ive tried ive failed"" clearly refers to past actions.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no specific plan or method mentioned for a *current* suicidal action. The desire is present (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself""), but no accompanying method or preparation is described for *now*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""the past two times ive tried ive failed"" is a direct and explicit description of past suicide attempts. This is a concrete action taken with intent to die, regardless of the outcome (failure).
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes past suicide attempts (""the past two times ive tried ive failed""). According to the ""ATTEMPT"" category definition and the critical rules, if a post describes past completed suicide attempts, it should be classified as ATTEMPT. Even though there is current ideation (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself""), the explicit mention of past attempts takes precedence.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post expresses a current, ongoing feeling (""I don't want to be alive""). There are no indicators of immediate intent (""tonight,"" ""now"") or past actions (""I tried"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts or interrupted actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""killing myself,"" ""don't want to be alive""), so it's not INDICATOR.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""My desire to kill myself has not [died down],"" and ""Killing myself is painful, sure."" It also expresses a desire for death with a method: ""if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The desire to kill oneself is current (""has not [died down]""). The mention of past attempts (""twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months"") provides context for the current state. The preference for the train method is current (""at this point"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific method: ""getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape."" While not a concrete *plan to act now*, it's presented as a chosen means of death.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states, ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months."" This is a clear description of past completed suicide attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide ideation (""desire to kill myself"").
    *   It mentions a potential method (""getting hit by an incoming train"").
    *   Crucially, it describes *past completed suicide attempts* (""I've attempted an overdose"").
    *   According to the Critical Classification Rules, ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" The description of concrete past actions with intent to die (""attempted an overdose"") fits the ATTEMPT category perfectly. The presence of current ideation and a potential method does not override the explicit mention of past attempts.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post expresses extreme distress, fear, panic, and feeling overwhelmed (""fucking horrified"", ""keep crying and having panic attacks"", ""too much"", ""I'm going insane"", ""so fucking scared"").
    *   The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" indicates a strong dependency and distress if that condition isn't met, but it does *not* explicitly state a desire to die or end life. It's about not being able to *continue living in a specific way*, rather than not wanting to be alive at all.
    *   There are no explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""killing self,"" ""ending life,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""being dead,"" or ""not wanting to be alive."" Phrases like ""I want to be gone"" or ""I'm going to die soon"" are also absent in a suicidal context.
    *   Conclusion: No explicit suicide/death wishes identified.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and states: ""i'm fucking horrified and keep crying"", ""I can't live"", ""I'm going insane"". This indicates immediate and ongoing distress.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Based on Step 1, there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""Now it's time to end it"" explicitly indicates a desire to end life. The repeated ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" strongly implies past suicide attempts in the context of wanting to ""end it.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Now it's time to end it"" indicates current urgency. ""So I tried..."" indicates past actions.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method or location is mentioned for the *current* intent. However, the repeated ""I tried"" implies that specific methods were used in past actions.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The repeated phrase ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" clearly describes multiple past completed suicide attempts. This is a concrete action history.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts/desires: Yes (""end it"").
    *   Past suicide attempts: Yes (""I tried..."").
    *   According to the rules, if past attempts are mentioned, even alongside current plans, it should be classified as ATTEMPT. The definition of ATTEMPT states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" The repeated ""I tried"" signifies completed past actions.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   The post explicitly mentions past completed actions (""I tried..."").
*   The rule ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT"" directly applies here, as the user mentions past attempts and a current desire to ""end it."" This overrides a classification of BEHAVIOR or IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family"" which implies a desire to end life. It also says ""I'm not scared to die"" and most critically, ""I have a plan, note and date"". This confirms explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April"" indicates a current, active plan with a specific future timing.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly states ""I have a plan, note and date"". While a specific *method* (e.g., pills, jumping) isn't detailed, the mention of ""a plan"" and ""note"" constitutes specific plans and preparations according to the framework.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes current thoughts and a future plan. There is no mention of any past completed suicide attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""not scared to die"", ""have a plan"").
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation: Yes (""I have a plan, note and date"").

*   **Past vs. Present:** This is a current plan for the future, not a past completed action.
*   **When in Doubt:** This post clearly includes explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/preparations, which aligns perfectly with the BEHAVIOR category. It goes beyond IDEATION because of the plan/note/date, and it's not ATTEMPT because it's a future plan, not a past completed action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""actually do go through with it and kill myself,"" ""end up dead in a gutter,"" and ""this will probably be my last post ever."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current ""suicidal thoughts"" that are ""too much recently."" The user states ""I plan on going to a hospital"" and ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet."" This indicates current contemplation and immediate future intent, but the action (suicide) is still being debated, not actively in progress or completed.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post presents a dilemma: ""either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself."" While ""go through with it and kill myself"" expresses intent, it does *not* specify a *method* (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) or a *specific location* for the suicide itself. The mention of ""dead in a gutter"" is a predicted outcome, not a planned method for suicide. There are no preparations (notes, acquiring means) for suicide mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""how many cuts I have all over myself."" This indicates past self-harm behavior. However, it does not describe a past *suicide attempt* (an action taken with intent to die).

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (Rule 1: ""I'm going to kill myself""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicidal thoughts and expressions of wanting to die.
    *   There is *no specific plan or method* for *suicide* described. The user is debating between seeking help and ""going through with it,"" but the ""how"" of ""going through with it"" is absent. This aligns with the IDEATION definition: ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""
    *   It does not fit BEHAVIOR because there is no *specific* plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The ""plan"" is to go to a hospital *or* commit suicide, but the latter lacks specifics.
    *   It does not fit ATTEMPT because no past completed suicide attempt is described. The cuts are self-harm, not a described attempt to die.
    *   Applying ""When in Doubt"": Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION because no specific method/plan for suicide is mentioned.

The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and intent (""I'm going to kill myself"") but lacks a specific method or plan for *how* the suicide would be carried out. The user is still in the stage of debating options. The self-harm history indicates distress but doesn't elevate the current classification to ATTEMPT as it's not described as a past attempt to die.

I told someone that im suicidal, they know that if i hang out with them really helps me, but they don't do anything about, they insist that they care but i dont believe it, maybe its my brain playing with me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""can't kill myself"" and ""Im suicidal"". This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current feelings (""Im so tired"", ""can't kill myself"", ""I know a good clif"") and ongoing suicidal thoughts (""Im suicidal"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user states, ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"". This identifies a specific method (jumping from a cliff) and a specific location (""a good clif""), along with an assessment of its feasibility (""its possible to get there""). Even though they state they ""can't commit to it"", the *identification* of the method and location is present.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past completed attempts or interrupted attempts. The statement ""i just can't commit to it"" indicates an *inability* to act, not that an action was started and stopped.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"", ""suicidal""), so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Specific plans/methods/locations are mentioned (""a good clif"", ""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there""). This moves it beyond simple IDEATION.
    *   No past completed actions are described, so it's not ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, it fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR (explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods/preparations).

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" and ""suicidal"" are explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable, as no action was initiated. The person is expressing an *inability* to commit, not an interrupted action.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The focus is on current thoughts and current knowledge of a method/location.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of a specific method/location (""a good clif"") pushes it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR. The lack of a completed past action keeps it from being ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end suffering and wishing for non-existence: ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born."" These phrases indicate a desire for life to end or not to have existed, which falls under ""not wanting to be alive"" or ""being dead.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current, ongoing distress and a present desire for things to stop. There are no indicators of immediate action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is absolutely no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide/death wishes (""i wish i was never born,"" ""i just want it all to stop"") but no specific plan or method. According to the framework, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""i wish i was never born"" is an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive. ""i just want it all to stop"" in this context also implies wanting life to end.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""i wish i was never born"" clearly pushes this beyond INDICATOR into IDEATION. There is no plan or method, so it's not BEHAVIOR. There's no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"". It also mentions ""funeral"", implying death. This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I can't wait to"" indicates a current, strong desire for a future action. ""It's gonna be"" reinforces this future intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research is mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted actions are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"") but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. It does not describe a past completed attempt. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"" is an explicit expression of a death wish.
*   There are no specific plans or methods mentioned, so it doesn't escalate to BEHAVIOR.
*   There's no description of a completed past action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""end it all"" is an explicit mention of ending life. ""goodbye everybody"" further reinforces suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm ready. I'm finally ready"" indicates a current state of decision. ""gonna wait a few weeks"" indicates a future timing for the action, but the decision and plan are present *now*.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" explicitly states that a plan/method is in place. While the method isn't detailed, the *knowledge* of it is present, which qualifies as a plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""all ready tried that before and no one really understands"" refers to past attempts to communicate or seek help, not a past suicide attempt. There is no description of a concrete past action taken with intent to die.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""end it all"") AND a clear indication of a plan/method (""I already know how I'm gonna do it""). This aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR. There is no description of a completed past attempt.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""end it all"" is explicit.
*   The knowledge of a method (""I already know how I'm gonna do it"") moves it beyond mere ideation to behavior, as a specific plan exists.
*   No past completed attempt is described.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I can't even fucking kill my self"" and ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""I can't even fucking kill my self"" and ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" indicate a current, immediate struggle with suicidal intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""I hold the blade"". This is a specific method (blade) and indicates the means are present and being considered or interacted with for the purpose of suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" describes an action that was initiated (holding the blade) with suicidal intent but was stopped or not completed. According to the Critical Classification Rules, ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT.""
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"").
    *   A specific method is mentioned (""blade"").
    *   An action related to the method was initiated but interrupted (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"").
    *   Based on the Critical Classification Rules, specifically the point about ""Interrupted Actions,"" this falls under BEHAVIOR. It's not ATTEMPT because the action was not completed. It's not IDEATION because a specific method and an initiated action are present.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"". This is a clear mention of wanting to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""how about i die then"" suggests a current thought or consideration.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations, or research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""how about i die then"") but no specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the decision logic, this classifies as IDEATION.

At least I DID try.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""killing myself will happen"" and ""I will be taking my own life."" It also says ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday,"" which is a clear expression of a death wish/certainty of death.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life."" This indicates a firm decision and future intent. ""When it will happen I am unsure, but I do know that I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)"" provides a timeline, even if the exact moment is not specified.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) is mentioned. No specific location is mentioned. No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are described beyond having a wallpaper reminder, which reinforces the decision but isn't a preparation for a specific method. No research for methods is mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""At least I DID try"" is ambiguous. It does not describe a concrete, completed suicide attempt (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I jumped""). It's more likely referring to past efforts to cope or live, given the context of hopelessness. It does not meet the criteria for an ATTEMPT, which requires a concrete past action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""killing myself will happen,"" ""taking my own life"").
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is described.
    *   No concrete past suicide attempt is described.

    Based on the definitions:
    *   INDICATOR is ruled out due to explicit suicide mentions.
    *   BEHAVIOR is ruled out because there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations.
    *   ATTEMPT is ruled out because ""At least I DID try"" is not a description of a concrete, completed past action.

    The post fits the definition of IDEATION: ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" The certainty (""100% confirmed"") makes it a very strong form of ideation, but it remains ideation without a method.

I shouldn't have talked myself down . Everyday I want to go back and kill myself . The worse decision I ever made was staying here .",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" multiple times (""perfect opportunity to kill myself"", ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself""). It also expresses regret for not having done so (""I was a pussy"", ""I shouldn't have talked myself down"", ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here""). This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""6 month ago"" refers to a past opportunity.
    *   ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"" indicates an ongoing, current desire/ideation.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a ""perfect opportunity"" in the past but does not describe any specific method or plan for *current* action. It doesn't say what the ""opportunity"" was, nor does it describe any current preparations or research.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a past situation where the person *could have* acted (""perfect opportunity"") but *did not* (""I was a pussy"", ""I shouldn't have talked myself down""). This means an attempt was *not* made; it was a missed opportunity or a thought process that led to *not* acting. It is not a completed action, nor is it an interrupted *attempt* (where action was initiated).

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"", ""want to go back and kill myself""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts, but NO current plan/method/preparation described. The past ""opportunity"" was not acted upon, and no details of a method are given for the past or present.
    *   It does *not* describe a past completed suicide attempt. The person explicitly states they *didn't* do it (""I was a pussy"", ""shouldn't have talked myself down"").

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The past event was *not* an interrupted action; it was a decision *not* to act. ""I shouldn't have talked myself down"" means they prevented themselves from acting, not that they started and stopped.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post has a strong current component (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"") which is clear ideation. The past context reinforces the depth of this ideation but doesn't change the classification to BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT based on the definitions.
*   **When in Doubt:**
    *   It's clearly IDEATION over INDICATOR due to explicit mention of ""kill myself"".
    *   It's IDEATION over BEHAVIOR because there is no *current* specific plan, method, or preparation. The past ""opportunity"" is not a described method or plan for *current* action, nor was it acted upon.
    *   It's IDEATION over ATTEMPT because no concrete past action was taken; the person explicitly states they *didn't* act on the opportunity.

Therefore, the post expresses a strong, ongoing desire to die, but without a current plan or method, and the past event described was a missed opportunity, not an actual attempt.

I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress, feelings of weakness, being pathetic, and hopelessness about a difficult social situation (""I'm too weak"", ""I'm pathetic"", ""know it's never gonna happen"").
    *   However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, ""going to die"", ""want to be gone"", ""don't want to survive"", or ""want it to be over"". The distress is related to social interactions and self-perception, not a desire to end life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   The post describes current and ongoing distress related to a specific interpersonal conflict. No timing indicators related to suicidal intent are present.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No suicide content is identified, therefore no plans or methods are mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No suicide content is identified, therefore no past attempts or self-harm behaviors related to suicide are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Based on step 1, there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned.
    *   According to the framework: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases used (e.g., ""I'm pathetic"", ""how weak I am"") convey distress and low self-worth, but they do not explicitly or implicitly express a desire for death or to end life. They describe emotional pain and a feeling of being stuck in a difficult situation.
*   **When in Doubt:** The post clearly lacks any explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, placing it firmly in the INDICATOR category. It expresses distress and hopelessness without crossing the line into suicidal ideation.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I just want to not exist"" is an explicit expression of wanting to end one's life/existence, fitting the criteria for ""not wanting to be alive."" The mention of ""kill myself working"" is explicitly stated as metaphorical.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The desire ""I just want to not exist"" is current. The distress is framed around ""Today's my birthday.""
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research about suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide/death wishes (""I just want to not exist"") but no specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the decision logic, this classifies as IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I just want to not exist"" is considered an explicit expression of a death wish, moving it beyond INDICATOR.
*   There are no plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, so it does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.

This clearly indicates suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language used (""I'm losing my mind,"" ""I'm having a complete breakdown,"" ""I just want to,"" ""I can't take it anymore"") indicates current and immediate distress and desires.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""I just want to put a bullet right through it"" explicitly mentions a specific method (bullet) and a target (brain/head). This constitutes a specific method. Although the user states ""i don't have the balls to take my own life,"" the *desire* for the specific method is clearly articulated.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted actions. The user explicitly states ""i don't have the balls to take my own life,"" indicating a lack of past action.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes.
    *   Specific plan/method/preparation: Yes (""put a bullet right through it"").
    *   According to the decision logic, if explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation, it classifies as BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable; these are the user's own desires.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable; no action described.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes current desires and thoughts.

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a specific method (""bullet"") points directly to BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide watch,"" ""don't want to die,"" ""better if i was dead,"" and ""wish i could just fucking end it."" It also mentions ""take a bunch of pills."" All these are explicit mentions of suicide or death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""i could take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep"" indicates a current thought about a potential immediate action. ""i can't keep doing this it's too much"" indicates current distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post clearly states a specific method: ""take a bunch of pills."" It also includes a timing/context: ""while everyones asleep."" This constitutes a specific plan/method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""i'm on suicide watch"" which implies past risk or monitoring, but it does *not* describe a *completed* past suicide attempt by the user. The action described (""i could take..."") is a contemplated future action, not a past completed one.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present, so not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present AND a specific plan/method (""take a bunch of pills"") is mentioned, so not IDEATION.
    *   The post describes explicit suicidal thoughts AND a specific plan/method. This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR.
    *   It does not describe a *completed* past suicide attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT. The ""i could take..."" indicates a contemplated action, not an action that has already occurred.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit suicide content is present.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not framed as intrusive thoughts, but a direct contemplation of a method.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** This is a *contemplated* action, not an initiated and interrupted action.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The core of the post is about current feelings and a contemplated future action with a method.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of a specific method (""pills"") pushes it definitively from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR. There is no description of a completed past action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post mentions the author's own history: ""I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life,"" ""haven't had suicidal ideation in months,"" and ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" It also mentions ""how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets).""
    *   *Critical Rule Application:* ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned."" Therefore, all mentions of the friend's suicidal thoughts are ignored for classification.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS (for the author):**
    *   The author explicitly states, ""Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me)."" This indicates no current urgency or active suicidal thoughts for the author.
    *   The mentions of suicide/attempts are in the past tense (""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009"").

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT (for the author):**
    *   The author mentions ""I faltered in my plan"" related to the past attempt. This implies a past plan, but no current plan or method is discussed for the author.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY (for the author):**
    *   The author states, ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded.""
    *   They further clarify, ""I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets.""

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The author describes a past ""attempt.""
    *   The critical rule ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT"" is crucial here.
    *   The author's explanation ""I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets"" strongly suggests an action that was initiated but then stopped or not fully carried out to its intended conclusion due to internal decision. This fits the definition of an ""interrupted attempt where action was initiated,"" which the rules classify as **BEHAVIOR**.
    *   Even though the author is currently ""in a good place"" and has no current ideation, the post *describes* a past event that falls under the ""BEHAVIOR"" category based on the specific definition of ""interrupted actions."" The classification is for the content of the post itself.
    *   The ""When in Doubt"" rule ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions"" reinforces this. Since the action was ""faltered"" and ""failed"" due to second thoughts, it was not a ""completed"" action in the sense of being carried out fully to its intended (fatal) conclusion, even if it was serious. It was an interrupted action.

I'm tired of always being afraid and upset over little things, I'm tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation. I wish I could be so much better than I am so I didn't live every moment in shame. Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" is a clear, albeit euphemistic, explicit mention of suicide thoughts. The user also states, ""And it's tempting a lot of the time,"" indicating these thoughts are not just present but are considered appealing.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""I still get the... thoughts"" and ""it's tempting a lot of the time"" indicates these are ongoing, general thoughts rather than immediate plans or past events.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""sewer slide"") but does not include any specific plans, methods, or preparations. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kermit sewer slide"" is considered explicit in this context.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** While it mentions thoughts, the addition of ""And it's tempting a lot of the time"" goes beyond purely intrusive thoughts that are resisted; it suggests a degree of consideration, which falls under IDEATION. Even if it were purely intrusive, the rule states explicit mention of suicide leads to IDEATION.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly falls between INDICATOR (because it's more than just distress) and BEHAVIOR (because there's no plan). Since there's explicit suicide mention but no plan, IDEATION is the correct category.

40,"I hate myself so much. Overall I'm terrible. And I know I'm objective because there are some good things about me, I have a few talents and positive traits. But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward and don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I hate being alive,"" ""makes me want to kill myself,"" ""I want to kill myself so badly,"" ""people who want to die can,"" and ""if I did kill myself."" It also mentions ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train."" These are clear and repeated explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language ""I want to kill myself so badly,"" ""It's looking pretty good,"" and ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"" indicates current and immediate desire/consideration.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post includes a specific method and location: ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train."" This is a concrete plan. The mention of ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" also indicates thinking about preparations, even if they are a barrier.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt. The post focuses on current desires and potential future actions.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, ruling out INDICATOR.
    *   A specific plan/method (""jump in front of a train"") is clearly mentioned, ruling out IDEATION.
    *   No past *completed* attempt is described, ruling out ATTEMPT. The user wishes they had the guts, indicating a desired future action, not a past completed one.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a specific plan/method classifies this as BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit suicide content is abundant.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable; these are the user's expressed desires.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** No interrupted action is described.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The focus is on present desire and future potential action.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of a specific method (""jump in front of a train"") pushes it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR. It does not describe a *completed* past action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"" and ""everyone would be better off with me dead."" This clearly indicates suicide content and death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""I want to kill myself"" and ""i cant breathe"" indicate a current and immediate state of distress and desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), specific location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I want to kill myself,"" ""better off with me dead"") but *no* specific plan or method. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The statements are explicit.
*   **When in Doubt:** The post clearly falls into IDEATION as it has explicit suicide mention but no plan. It does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR (no plan) or ATTEMPT (no past completed action). It's definitely not INDICATOR due to explicit suicide content.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""i thought about slitting my wrists today"". This is a direct mention of a suicide-related action/method. ""growing more depressed and feeling more alone"" indicates general distress.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""today"" indicates a recent or current thought. ""i didnt do it"" clarifies the action was not taken.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post states ""i thought about... but i didnt do it"". This indicates a contemplation of a specific action, not a past completed attempt, nor an interrupted attempt where action was initiated.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts: Yes (""thought about slitting my wrists"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes, ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method.
    *   This aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR: ""Posts with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods..."". It is not an ATTEMPT because the action was not completed.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""slitting my wrists"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The post explicitly states ""i didn't do it,"" meaning the action was not initiated or completed. However, the *thought* of a specific method is present. This fits the BEHAVIOR category because it involves explicit suicidal thoughts *and* a specific method. It's not an ATTEMPT as no action was taken.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The thought was ""today,"" indicating present or very recent contemplation.

Based on the rules, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts (""thought about"") combined with a specific method (""slitting my wrists"") categorizes this as BEHAVIOR. It's not an ATTEMPT because the action was not carried out.

I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""the suicidal feelings are coming back."" This is a direct mention of suicide-related content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""are coming back"" indicates a current and ongoing state.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods. The focus is on dental pain and returning feelings.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""suicidal feelings are coming back,"" which implies a history of such feelings, but it does *not* describe any past completed suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. It refers to a state of mind, not an action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""suicidal feelings"") but no specific plan or method. According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.
    *   It's not INDICATOR because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i'm someone who wants to die"". This is a direct expression of a death wish.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The statement ""i'm someone who wants to die"" indicates an ongoing state or desire, not an immediate or past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters,"" which are direct references to suicide. Phrases like ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""My minds made up"" strongly indicate a desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""My minds made up"" indicate immediate and current intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user is asking ""how to write good suicide notes"" and ""need help on the goodbye letters."" This is a clear indication of preparation for an act of suicide. While not a method of death, writing notes is a specific preparatory step.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""suicide notes,"" ""leaving soon"") AND describes a specific preparation (""writing good suicide notes,"" ""goodbye letters""). This aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR. It's not just ideation because there's an active step of preparation being sought. It's not an attempt because no past completed action is described.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""Suicide notes"" is explicit. ""Leaving soon"" is explicit in context.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable.
*   Past vs. Present: Focus is on current intent and preparation.
*   When in Doubt: It's clearly beyond IDEATION due to the specific preparation (writing notes). It's not ATTEMPT because no action was completed. Therefore, BEHAVIOR is the correct category.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon,"" ""save some flowers for me please?"" (implying death), ""I didn't die last night,"" and ""suicidality."" It also refers to ""constant attempts"" implying past actions to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it (doubt ill make it that long)"" indicates specific, immediate future timing and high urgency. ""end thing v v soon"" reinforces this. ""last night"" refers to a very recent past event where the person almost died. ""10 yrs of the worst of this hell, 8 yrs of constant attempts"" indicates a long history.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific ""suicide date"" (Friday, May 14, 2021) is given, which constitutes a specific plan and timing. ""save some flowers for me please?"" can be interpreted as a preparation or acknowledgement of the planned outcome. No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, but the date itself is a strong indicator of a plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states ""8 yrs of constant attempts."" This is a clear description of past completed suicide attempts. ""obv I wasn't trying hard enough"" confirms these were actions with intent to die. ""only reason I didn't die last night"" suggests a very recent interrupted attempt or close call.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific plan (suicide date) is present, which would point to BEHAVIOR.
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly describes *past suicide attempts* (""8 yrs of constant attempts"").
    *   According to the ""Critical Classification Rules,"" specifically ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions"" and ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""

The phrase ""until in my grave I lay"" also contributes to this theme, though less directly.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I want to disappear forever"" indicates a current desire. ""I know I will die by 35"" indicates a self-imposed future limit for life, implying an intention or strong belief about ending it.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research about methods mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""count my pills"" is a specific preparation. ""take them all"" refers to a specific method (overdose). This clearly identifies a plan/method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post states ""why i didnt take them all,"" which means a completed attempt did *not* occur. It describes contemplation and preparation, not a past completed action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""wonder why i didnt take them all"" in context of pills).
    *   A specific plan/method (""pills,"" ""take them all"") and preparation (""count my pills"") are present.
    *   It is not a past completed suicide attempt because the post states the action *didn't* happen.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" is explicit in context.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** While not an interrupted *physical* action, the ""counting pills"" is a preparatory *behavior* linked to a specific method. The regret of not taking them indicates ongoing suicidal ideation with a method.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post is about ongoing thoughts and preparations (""every night i count... every day i wonder""). It's not a past completed event.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly moves beyond IDEATION due to the specific method (pills) and preparation (counting them). It is not ATTEMPT because the action was not completed. Therefore, BEHAVIOR is the correct classification.

Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me. I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again. I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post mentions ""The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately"" and a ""major downward spiral.""
    *   It states, ""I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again."" While fear of the psych ward often *implies* suicidal ideation or crisis, the post *does not explicitly* state ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" or any direct equivalent. It refers to ""the thoughts"" and ""this"" without explicitly defining them as suicidal.
    *   According to the definition of IDEATION, it requires ""explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life."" This post does not meet that explicit criterion.
    *   According to the definition of INDICATOR, it includes posts ""WITHOUT any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die.""

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""lately,"" ""in the past few months,"" ""Everyday"" indicate ongoing distress, but no immediate urgency for action.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""don't want to end up in the psych ward again"" implies a past hospitalization. However, it does not describe a past *suicide attempt* (a concrete action taken with intent to die). It describes a past *institutionalization*, which could be for various mental health reasons.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Based on the analysis, there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned. The distress is clear, and the fear of the psych ward suggests severe mental health issues, but the direct, explicit statement of wanting to die or commit suicide is absent.
    *   Therefore, the classification falls under INDICATOR.
    *   Critical Rule check: ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention."" There is no explicit mention.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I've lost all will to live"" and ""I know it sounds so stupid to want to die"". These are clear mentions of not wanting to be alive and wanting to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language ""I can't do this anymore,"" ""I don't wanna do this anymore,"" ""I've lost all will to live,"" and ""want to die"" indicates a current, ongoing state of distress and desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods mentioned in the post.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""lost all will to live"", ""want to die""). However, there is NO plan, method, or preparation mentioned. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I've lost all will to live"" and ""want to die"" are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   No plan or method is present, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, so it's not ATTEMPT.
*   Since explicit suicide thoughts are present, it is not INDICATOR.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""my death,"" ""I don't want to live anymore,"" and ""when i off myself."" These are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""I don't want to live anymore"" and ""i can't continue to live"" indicate current, ongoing distress. ""when i off myself"" points to a potential future action, not a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location (e.g., bridge), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research is mentioned. The thoughts are general about ending life.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""my death,"" ""off myself,"" ""don't want to live anymore""), so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   No plan/method means it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   No past completed action means it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I don't want to live anymore"" and ""when i off myself"" are explicit expressions of death wishes, confirming it's not INDICATOR.
*   There are no specific plans or methods, so it remains IDEATION rather than BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed actions are described, so it's not ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""i know that i'm going to end up getting fed up of all this bullshit and just killing myself."" This is a clear and direct mention of suicide. The phrase ""what's the fucking point in any of this"" and ""what's the point in not"" reinforce a sense of hopelessness leading to suicidal thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""i know that i'm going to end up getting fed up... and just killing myself"" indicates a perceived future inevitability rather than an immediate or current plan. It's a prediction of a future action, not an immediate intent or ongoing action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""killing myself""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""killing myself""), but there is NO plan/method. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""killing myself"" is explicit.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit suicide mention (""killing myself"") moves it beyond INDICATOR. The *absence* of any plan or method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR. The statement ""going to end up...killing myself"" is an expression of suicidal thought and a perceived future action, not a concrete plan or past attempt. Therefore, IDEATION is the correct classification.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""tried to kms"" (kill myself) is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The word ""yesterday"" indicates a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post doesn't describe a *future* plan or method, but rather refers to a *past action*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""tried to kms yesterday"" explicitly describes a past suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a concrete action (""tried to kms"") that occurred in the past (""yesterday"") with intent to die. This directly matches the definition of ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""tried to kms"" is an explicit expression of a past suicide attempt.
*   The action is in the past (""yesterday"").
*   The definition of ATTEMPT states: ""Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome. Must involve a concrete action that occurred in the past"". This perfectly aligns with ""tried to kms yesterday"".

To the point that I question if I did something horrific in a previous life and it was so bad that I'm still paying for it in this life. I cant. Please. I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" and ""I cant live anymore."" Both clearly express a desire to end life. ""Do this"" in context refers to ending life. ""I can't live anymore"" is an explicit death wish.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language ""I can't,"" ""Please,"" ""I can't live anymore"" indicates a current and immediate state of distress and desire to end life.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" indicates a search or contemplation of a method, even if a specific one isn't named. This falls under ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" or ""research"" as described in the BEHAVIOR category. It's not just wanting to die, but actively thinking about *how* to die in a specific way (non-painful).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I can't live anymore""). So, not INDICATOR.
    *   The phrase ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" implies seeking or researching a method, which is a component of the BEHAVIOR category (""Seeking information about suicide methods""). It moves beyond just ideation (wanting to die) to contemplating the *means* of dying.
    *   No past completed attempt is described, so not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   ""I can't live anymore"" is explicit. ""Non painful way to do this"" is explicit about the intent and a criteria for the method.
*   The search for a ""non painful way"" is considered seeking information/research about methods, pushing it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed actions.

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with the contemplation/search for a specific *type* of method (non-painful) aligns with the BEHAVIOR category's description of ""Seeking information about suicide methods.""

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"" and ""write a suicide note."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""next week"" indicates a specific future timing. ""I want to do it"" and ""I just have to write"" indicate current intent and preparation for a future action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""with drugs"" as a specific method. It also mentions ""write a suicide note"" as a specific preparation.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past completed suicide attempts. The post describes future intent and current preparations.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I want to kill myself"") AND a specific plan/method (""with drugs"") AND preparation (""write a suicide note""). This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR. It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described. It is not IDEATION because a method and preparation are specified.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."" in the context of severe distress and hopelessness, explicitly indicates a desire to end their current state of being, which aligns with wanting to end life or ""want to be gone."" This is an explicit expression of a death wish.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""soon"" indicates a current and somewhat immediate desire. ""long overdue"" reinforces the ongoing nature of this desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (pills for suicide, jumping, hanging, weapons) is mentioned. The mention of ""none of the pills do enough"" refers to medication for illness, not a suicide method. No specific location or preparations are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes, ""ready to get this over with soon.""
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation? No specific plan or method is mentioned.
    *   Describes past suicide attempt? No.

    Based on the decision logic: If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I'm ready to get this over with soon"" is considered an explicit expression of a death wish in this context.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION because there is an explicit death/suicide mention. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION because no method/plan is mentioned.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft."" While the user says ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over,"" the action taken (overdose) is a common method for suicide attempts, and the desire for suffering to be over is a strong indicator of distress often associated with suicidal ideation. The overdose itself is the primary suicidal content here.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I finally went through,"" ""I have overdosed,"" and ""It hasn't been that long"" all indicate a completed action that occurred in the very recent past.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method is described: ""overdosed"" by taking ""500mg Zoloft."" This is a concrete and specific method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a completed action: ""I have overdosed."" This is a past attempt. The user is describing the immediate aftermath of this completed action.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a concrete, completed action (""I have overdosed,"" ""I took 500mg Zoloft"") that occurred in the past. This directly aligns with the definition of ATTEMPT: ""Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome."" Even if the user states ""it won't kill me"" or expresses ambivalence, the act of overdose is a completed action with intent to cause harm/end suffering, which falls under the ATTEMPT category. The critical rule ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions"" applies here.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrases ""I'm doing it,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" and ""I'm ready to go"" strongly imply a decision to end their life. While not using the exact words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" the context of feeling ""at peace"" and ""ready"" points unequivocally to suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""in the near future"" indicates a definite timeline for the intended action. ""right now, knowing I'm going to"" indicates a current state of firm decision.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location (e.g., bridge), or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The post describes a future intention, not a past action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes *are* mentioned (""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go""), so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts *are* present, but there is NO specific plan or method. This matches the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan/method/preparation, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I'm doing it"" and ""I'm ready to go"" are explicit expressions of death wishes in this context.
*   No specific plan or method is detailed, keeping it in IDEATION rather than BEHAVIOR.
*   The post describes a future intention, not a past completed action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i was suicidal"". This is a direct mention of suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post clearly states ""it was 4 yrs ago"". This indicates a past event, not a current state or immediate urgency. The post is reflecting on a past experience.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any current or past plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post says ""when my old high school found out i was suicidal"". This indicates a past state of having suicidal thoughts/ideation. It *does not* describe a past suicide attempt (a completed action) or an interrupted attempt. Being ""suicidal"" refers to the state of having suicidal thoughts, not necessarily acting on them.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"" - False, ""i was suicidal"" is explicit. So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"" - The post describes *past* explicit suicidal thoughts (""i was suicidal""), and there are no current plans/methods mentioned. While the definition for IDEATION leans towards *current* expressions, the post is *about* the experience of being suicidal (ideation).
    *   ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR"" - False, no current plan/method.
    *   ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT"" - False, the post states ""i was suicidal"" (a state of mind), not that a completed attempt occurred.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""i was suicidal"" is explicit.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post is clearly about a past event (""it was 4 yrs ago""). However, the categories need to be applied. Since ""suicidal"" is explicitly mentioned, it moves beyond INDICATOR. It's not an ATTEMPT as no completed action is described. It's not BEHAVIOR as there are no current plans. The post is a reflection *on* a past state of ideation. Given the options, and the explicit mention of ""suicidal,"" IDEATION is the most fitting category for a post that discusses being suicidal, even if in the past tense and without current intent or a past completed action. The post is fundamentally about the experience of having been suicidal.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly asks ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and states ""Might as well just die."" These are direct mentions of suicide and wanting to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Should I just give up? Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die"" indicate current contemplation and ongoing thoughts. ""not the first time, not the last one"" suggests a recurring pattern of these thoughts.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), no specific location, no preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), and no research about methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or specific self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself"", ""die"") but no specific plan or method. According to the framework, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""kill myself"" and ""die"" are explicit.
*   Intrusive Thoughts: While the user is questioning, the direct mention of ""kill myself"" qualifies it for IDEATION.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable.
*   Past vs. Present: The post is about current contemplation, not a past completed action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i should die"" and ""made up my mind to kill myself"". This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""i should die"" indicates a present desire. ""made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything"" indicates a past decision with current preparations.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""tho I have prepared everything"" is a strong indicator of preparations. While no specific method is named, the act of ""preparing everything"" falls under ""preparations: notes, acquiring means, specific setups.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a decision and preparations (""made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything""), but it does *not* describe a past completed suicide attempt. It's a state of readiness, not a completed action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""i should die"", ""kill myself"") AND mentions preparations (""prepared everything""). This combination aligns with the definition of **BEHAVIOR**. It is not an ATTEMPT because no completed action is described. It is not IDEATION because preparations are mentioned.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""where no one will find my body"" and ""Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol"". This clearly indicates a desire to end life and die by suicide. The phrase ""vanish without a trace"" in context also points to this.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The timing is conditional future (""When that happens I will have nothing to look forward to. So I would want to vanish...""). It's a planned future action, not immediate, but a definite intention given a trigger.

    *   There is no description of a *past completed* attempt.
    *   According to the rules, ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR"". This post fits this perfectly due to the explicit mention of a pistol as a method and detailed preparatory steps. It's not an ATTEMPT because it's a future plan, not a past completed action. It's not IDEATION because a specific method and detailed plan are present.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

What the fuck have I even become, I don't recognise myself anymore, fuck the mental health system.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die."" It also says ""i give up now"" and ""Im this fucking close,"" which, in context of wanting to die, indicates a desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I want to die"" and ""i give up now"" indicate a current and immediate state. ""Im this fucking close"" suggests proximity to action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does not describe any past suicide attempts or interrupted actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to die"").
    *   There is NO plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    *   There is NO past suicide attempt described.
    *   According to the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I want to die"" is an explicit expression of a death wish.
*   There are no plans or methods, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
*   There are no past completed actions, so it's not ATTEMPT.
*   Given the explicit mention of wanting to die, it cannot be INDICATOR.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years"", ""when i do do it"", ""I dont want the existance ive got"", ""I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone"", ""making it easier to do something"", and ""I feel im on the edge... away from goin over that edge"". This clearly indicates explicit suicide content and wishes for death.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes an ongoing state (""suicidal for about 10 years"", ""feelings are always there""), past preparations (""Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones""), and recent/current decisions regarding a plan (""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes""). The phrase ""I feel im on the edge"" indicates a current state of high risk.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user states: ""ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police."" This is a highly specific plan, including a chosen location (""the woodland"") and preparations for the aftermath (""leave notes on the paths... to warn the dog walkers... and to call the police""). While a specific *means* (like ""rope"") hasn't been acquired, the *plan* is detailed and explicit.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The user mentions ""I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face"". This describes past self-harm behaviors, but it does not describe past *suicide attempts* (actions taken with intent to die).

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (Step 1). So, not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, AND specific plans/preparations are detailed (Step 3: chosen location, notes for aftermath). This aligns with BEHAVIOR.
    *   No past completed suicide attempts are described (Step 4). The self-harm was not described as an attempt to die.

    *Critical Classification Rule Check:*
    *   Rule 1 (Explicit vs. Implicit): Phrases like ""when i do do it"" and ""going over that edge"" are explicit.
    *   Rule 2 (Intrusive Thoughts): While intrusive thoughts are mentioned, the post goes far beyond this by detailing a specific plan.
    *   Rule 3 (Interrupted Actions): Not directly applicable, but the detailed plan is key.
    *   Rule 5 (When in Doubt): Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR because specific plans/methods are mentioned (""decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes"").

The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a specific chosen location and detailed preparations (leaving notes for discovery) clearly classifies this as BEHAVIOR.

I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore."" These are direct expressions of wanting to die/commit suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore"" indicate current and immediate thoughts/desires.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes frustration about a driving license situation but does not mention any specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does not describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I wanna off myself"", ""I don't even wanna live anymore""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts, but NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt, ruling out ATTEMPT.
    *   Since there's no plan/method, it does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.

Based on the rules, explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or method classify as IDEATION.

No one in my life cares. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to help me stay alive. No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""suicidal at my age"" - Explicit mention of suicidal thoughts.
    *   ""tonight's the night I guess"" - This strongly implies an intent to end life, linking to the suicidal thoughts. ""The night"" in this context refers to the night of the intended suicidal act.
    *   ""No one to help me stay alive"" - Explicitly indicates a struggle to survive and a desire to die.
    *   ""No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone"" - ""When I'm gone"" in this context refers to death by suicide.
    *   Conclusion: Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""tonight's the night"" - Clear, immediate timing.
    *   Conclusion: Strong urgency indicated.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post states ""tonight's the night I guess,"" which indicates a decision to act and a timeframe. However, it does *not* specify *how* (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) or *where* (e.g., a specific bridge, building). It also doesn't describe any preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
    *   Conclusion: No specific plan, method, or preparations are mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and future intent (""tonight's the night""). There is no mention of past completed suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
    *   Conclusion: No past action history.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal,"" ""tonight's the night,"" ""when I'm gone"").
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   No past completed attempt is described.
    *   Based on the rules: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"". The phrase ""tonight's the night"" indicates a strong *intent* and *urgency* for an action, but it lacks the *specifics* of a method or plan required for the BEHAVIOR category. The BEHAVIOR category specifically requires ""specific plans, methods, preparations, or research."" ""Tonight's the night"" is a timing and decision indicator, but not a method or preparation. Therefore, it falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""tonight's the night I guess"" and ""when I'm gone"" are explicit expressions of death wishes in context.
*   ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR"": The post has explicit suicidal thoughts and urgency, but *lacks specific methods, plans, or preparations*. This firmly places it in IDEATION, as BEHAVIOR requires these specifics.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""cutting an artery,"" which is a specific, lethal method of suicide. The question about ""taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery"" directly relates to facilitating this suicidal act. This is a clear discussion of a suicide method.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain...?"" indicates current contemplation and research regarding a potential future action. It's not a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method (""cutting an artery"") is identified. The inquiry about ""oxy"" is related to preparing for or executing this method by reducing pain. The phrase ""i just don't know who else to ask"" confirms that the user is seeking information related to this specific method, which falls under ""Research/seeking.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of a past completed suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present through the discussion of a specific lethal method and how to execute it.
    *   A specific plan/method (""cutting an artery"") is mentioned, along with seeking information about it.
    *   This is not a past completed action.

Based on the rules:
*   It's not INDICATOR because explicit suicide methods are discussed.
*   It's not IDEATION because specific plans/methods are explicitly mentioned and researched.
*   It is BEHAVIOR because it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (implied by the method discussion) AND specific plans/methods/preparations/research about suicide methods (""cutting an artery,"" asking about oxy to lessen pain, seeking information).
*   It's not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.

A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""die"" and ""kill myself"" multiple times, but *always* in the context of what the friend said about the poster, or the poster's reaction to the friend's words. The poster explicitly states, ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" which indicates a desire to live and cope, not to die. There is no explicit expression from the poster themselves of wanting to die, commit suicide, or not wanting to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The core event (friend's comment) happened ""a couple of weeks ago."" The poster's distress is current (""it's really played on my mind,"" ""not sitting well with me""). There is no urgency related to the poster's own suicidal intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned by the poster.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm actions are mentioned by the poster.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post expresses distress and hurt, but the person writing the post does *not* express any explicit suicide or death wishes for themselves. The mentions of suicide are external (from the friend) and the poster is reacting to those comments, not expressing their own suicidal ideation. Therefore, based on ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I want to be gone"" are not present from the poster's own perspective. The mentions of ""die"" or ""kill myself"" are attributed to the friend's statement or the poster's reflection on the friend's statement, not the poster's own desire. The poster's own statement (""doing my best to fight my mental illness"") contradicts a death wish.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable. The thoughts are about the friend's hurtful words, not the poster's own intrusive suicidal thoughts.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The distress is present, but it's about the friend's past hurtful statement and how to navigate the relationship, not about the poster's current suicidal intent.
*   **When in Doubt:** The core rule ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"" applies here. The poster is discussing distress and relationship issues, without expressing a personal desire for death or suicide.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""jump out"" in the context of distress and being at a window explicitly indicates a desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""right now"" and ""im about to cut the screen and jump out"" indicate immediate urgency and an imminent action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Specific method: ""jump out""
    *   Specific location: ""at my window""
    *   Preparations/means: ""with scissors"" (to ""cut the screen"" as a step towards jumping)
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of past completed attempts. The described action is current and imminent.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts (""jump out"") are present, along with a specific plan, method, and preparations (""at my window,"" ""with scissors,"" ""cut the screen,"" ""jump out""). This aligns with the ""BEHAVIOR"" category.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""jump out"" is an explicit death wish in context.
*   The post describes an imminent action with a plan and means, not a past completed attempt. It is a current intention to act. This falls under BEHAVIOR.
*   It's not an interrupted attempt, but rather an *imminent* one, which is still classified under BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i'm gonna overdose on iron pills,"" which is a clear expression of wanting to end life. ""i don't wanna deal with it"" also implies a desire to escape life's difficulties, leading to the suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""i'm gonna overdose"" indicates an immediate or very near-future intention (""going to"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post specifies a method: ""overdose on iron pills."" This is a concrete and specific plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a future intention (""i'm gonna""), not a past completed action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""overdose"").
    *   A specific plan/method is mentioned (""iron pills"").
    *   It is not a past completed suicide attempt.
    *   According to the framework: If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
*   It's explicit.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""im going to kill myself one day,"" ""might as well die,"" and ""just want to run away to a forest and fucking die."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""one day,"" ""might as well,"" and ""just want to"" suggest ongoing ideation and a future possibility/desire rather than immediate intent. The phrase ""the only thing that's stopping is..."" indicates current suicidal thoughts that are being resisted by a slim hope.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""run away to a forest and fucking die."" ""Forest"" is a specific location. While the exact *mechanism* of dying in the forest isn't detailed, the mention of a specific *location* as part of the desired scenario for death qualifies as a component of a plan, according to the BEHAVIOR definition (""Identifying specific locations"").

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There is a mention of a specific location (""forest"") as part of the desired death scenario (""run away to a forest and fucking die""). This moves it beyond simple ideation (""I want to die"") to include a specific element of *how* or *where* that death would occur.
    *   According to the rules: ""BEHAVIOR: Posts with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations... This includes: Identifying specific locations."" The mention of ""forest"" fits this criterion.
    *   It is not an ATTEMPT because it describes a desired future action/scenario, not a past completed action.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a specific location for the desired death classifies it as BEHAVIOR.

This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes an ongoing state (""every night,"" ""every single day,"" ""every day I'm forced to realize"") and current desires (""Hoping to be murdered,"" ""I wish so badly,"" ""I want to die""). The distress and desire for death are present and continuous.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific desired method: ""murder."" It also describes a specific, repeated action taken with the intent to facilitate this method: ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night."" This is a passive but deliberate action/preparation taken with the hope of achieving death via a specific method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post states ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself,"" indicating no past self-initiated attempts. The action of ""walking through sketchy areas every night"" is described as ongoing and *not* having resulted in the desired outcome (""but it never works""). Therefore, it is not a past completed attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes (Step 1). So, not INDICATOR.
    *   There is a specific desired method (""murder"") and a specific action/preparation taken to facilitate it (""walking through sketchy areas every night""). This goes beyond mere IDEATION.
    *   The actions described are current/ongoing behaviors and preparations, not past completed attempts.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   The desire for death and specific method are explicit.
*   The action of walking through sketchy areas nightly with the hope of being murdered constitutes a specific action/preparation aimed at achieving death, even if passive. This aligns with the ""BEHAVIOR"" category's description of ""specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods.""
*   It is not an ATTEMPT because no completed action is described; the person states ""it never works.""

Based on the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific, repeated action taken with the intent/hope of facilitating a specific method of death (murder), the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit mentions of wanting to die (""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"" in context, ""See you all on the other side"").
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language indicates current and immediate intent (""I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"", ""can't take no more"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""I'll experience it painfully,"" which describes a characteristic of the desired death but does *not* specify a method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), a location, or any preparations. There is no specific plan or method mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted attempts. The language refers to future intent.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm going to die"", ""See you all on the other side"").
    *   NO specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The phrase ""painfully"" describes the *nature* of the desired death, not the *means* to achieve it.
    *   No past completed action is described, so it's not ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, it fits the criteria for IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die without specific plans, methods, or preparations.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I'm going to die"" is explicit.
*   No interrupted actions or past attempts.
*   Focus is on present intent.
*   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose IDEATION because no method/plan is mentioned. The ""painfully"" aspect does not constitute a specific method or plan.

I am starting to not care if there's an afterlife or not, but i still want happiness, it's just been out of my reach for beyond a decade, and im starting to want to wave the white flag. If you read all this thank you for listening to my rant, I truly appreciate it.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains several explicit expressions of not wanting to be alive or wanting to end their life:
    *   ""I just don't wanna be here"" - This is a direct statement of not wanting to be alive.
    *   ""I don't think I can do it anymore"" - In the context of the preceding statement and overall despair, this strongly implies ending the struggle of life.
    *   ""starting to want to wave the white flag"" - This is a metaphorical expression of giving up on life or the struggle to survive.
    These phrases indicate explicit death wishes or a desire to end their existence.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language used (""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" ""I am starting to not care,"" ""im starting to want to wave the white flag"") indicates current feelings and an ongoing, worsening state of despair. There are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but the expressions are about their present state of mind.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does NOT mention any specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does NOT describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or concrete self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""I've tried every way to cope"" refers to coping mechanisms, not suicide attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned (""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore,"" ""wave the white flag""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts, but NO specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no mention of specific plans, methods, or preparations, ruling out BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a completed past suicide attempt, ruling out ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I just don't wanna be here"" and ""I don't think I can do it anymore"" are considered explicit expressions of death wishes in this context.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit death/suicide mentions. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION as no method/plan is mentioned.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I have to kill myself"" and ""Death is my only option right now."" It also says ""It'd be worse staying alive,"" indicating a desire not to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""I have to kill myself,"" ""right now,"" and ""I have to do this"" indicate current and immediate intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted actions are described.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: The statements are explicit.
*   Intrusive Thoughts: Not applicable.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable.

The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago,"" indicating the poster has experienced suicidal thoughts. More importantly, it states ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and ""I just wish I could donate my life,"" which are clear expressions of not wanting to be alive and a desire to end one's life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" indicates a current/ongoing state. The ""suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to a past state, but the current desire not to live is present.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts (e.g., ""I tried to,"" ""I overdosed"") or interrupted attempts are described. The phrase ""suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to a state, not a concrete action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes (""don't want to live,"" ""suicidal like me,"" ""wish I could donate my life"").
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation? No.
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action)? No.
    *   Therefore, it falls under the ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"" category.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Don't want to live"" and ""wish I could donate my life"" are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not directly applicable, but the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal like me"") and desire not to live confirms ideation.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The current desire not to live is the primary factor.
*   **When in Doubt:** It's clearly past INDICATOR due to explicit death wishes. It's not BEHAVIOR because there's no plan/method. It's not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.

This post contains explicit expressions of not wanting to live and identifies the poster as having been suicidal, but it lacks any specific plans, methods, or descriptions of past attempts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon."" It also implies a desire for death with ""Soda and junk will kill me faster.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm ready to die"" indicates a current state. ""I'm stopping all my meds today"" and ""I'm quitting therapy"" indicate immediate actions. ""Hope it all ends soon"" refers to a desired future outcome.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" This is a specific, concrete action (cessation of vital medication) that, in the context of wanting to die, can be considered a preparation or a passive method to hasten death by destabilizing health and mental state.
    *   ""I'm quitting therapy."" This is another concrete action to remove support, aligning with the desire to end things.
    *   ""Soda and junk will kill me faster."" This indicates a chosen passive method (unhealthy lifestyle) with the intent of hastening death.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   Specific plans/methods/preparations are present: stopping all medications (including mental health meds) and quitting therapy *today*, and embracing unhealthy eating with the intent to die. These are concrete actions taken to disengage from life-preserving measures and hasten death.
    *   According to the rules, ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" The actions described (stopping meds, quitting therapy, embracing unhealthy eating for death) are specific preparations/methods.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I'm ready to die"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** Focus is on current desire and immediate actions/preparations.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit death wishes combined with concrete, immediate actions (stopping meds, quitting therapy) that align with and facilitate that desire pushes this beyond mere ideation into behavior. It's not just thinking about it; it's actively disengaging from life-sustaining support and embracing self-destructive behaviors with the stated intent of dying.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I just want to disappear"" strongly implies a wish to cease to exist, which falls under ""not wanting to be alive"" or ""want to be gone."" The additional phrase ""broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain"" reinforces a desire for an end to suffering through non-existence. According to Critical Rule 1, ""Phrases like... 'I want to be gone' ARE explicit expressions of death wishes when in context of distress."" ""Disappear"" fits this criterion.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I just want to"" indicates a current, ongoing desire. No specific immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") is present, but it's a present state.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""disappear,"" ""free from all this pain"" interpreted as wanting to cease to exist). However, there is NO plan or method mentioned. This aligns with the ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"" rule.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I just want to disappear"" is considered an explicit expression of a death wish or wanting to not be alive in this context of distress.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of an explicit death wish (interpreted from ""disappear"") moves it beyond INDICATOR. The absence of a plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR.

Therefore, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts/wishes without a specific plan or method.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" and ""I just need a plan for suicide."" Both phrases directly mention suicide/killing self.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" and ""I just need a plan"" indicate current thoughts and an immediate need/desire for action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The statement ""Ps: I just need a plan for suicide"" is a direct indicator of seeking or preparing for a plan. While not a specific method, it falls under the ""preparations"" or ""seeking information about suicide methods"" criteria for BEHAVIOR. The user is actively looking for *how* to commit suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""kill myself"", ""suicide""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   A plan/method/preparation is indicated by ""I just need a plan for suicide."" This phrase signifies active seeking or readiness to formulate a plan, moving beyond mere ideation without action steps. This rules out IDEATION.
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is described. This rules out ATTEMPT.

    Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with the active search/need for a plan classifies this as BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (in context of a failed attempt, indicating a death wish), and ""pretending to blow my brains out."" This clearly indicates suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""almost uncontrollably saying 'I'm going to kill myself'"" - Current, ongoing.
    *   ""my most recent failed attempt"" - Past event.
    *   ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" - Current/future intent.
    *   ""find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth"" - Current, ongoing behavior.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out"" describes a specific method (gun) and a simulated action, which falls under behavior related to a method.
    *   The ""failed attempt"" implies a past method was involved, though not specified.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""my most recent failed attempt"" is a direct and clear statement of a past suicide attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm going to kill myself"").
    *   Specific behaviors related to methods are described (""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out"").
    *   Crucially, a past suicide attempt is explicitly mentioned (""my most recent failed attempt"").

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit suicide wishes and actions are present.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The ""almost uncontrollably saying 'I'm going to kill myself'"" fits this, but it's still explicit ideation.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The ""finger gun"" is a simulated action, not an interrupted attempt. However, the post *also* mentions a ""failed attempt.""
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post mentions both past (failed attempt) and current/ongoing thoughts and behaviors. The rule states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""

Based on the explicit mention of a ""failed attempt,"" the classification must be ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment."" This is a direct and clear mention of suicide. Also, ""If that's what my life is going to be I don't want it"" implies not wanting to be alive in the current circumstances.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I'd rather kill myself now"" indicates immediate desire or current strong suicidal ideation. ""Endure another day"" also points to current distress and a desire for it to end soon.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out,"" and ""thoughts of how it would feel to die."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""every single day I still have the urge,"" ""I lay in bed at night, thoughts...rushing through my head"" indicate ongoing, current thoughts. ""I can never bring myself to actually do it"" and ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" indicate a current inability to act, not a past completed action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrases ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" constitute a specific method (gunshot) and implicitly a means (gun).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states ""I can never bring myself to actually do it"" and ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already,"" indicating no past attempts or interrupted actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I want to kill myself"") AND a specific method (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger""). It does *not* describe a completed past attempt. Therefore, it falls under **BEHAVIOR**.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit death wishes and method are present.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** While there's internal conflict, the explicit mention of a method (""blow my brains out"") moves it beyond mere ideation or intrusive thoughts into BEHAVIOR.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** No interrupted actions are described; rather, an *inability* to act.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The focus is on current urges and an inability to act, not past completed actions.
*   **When in Doubt:** This fits perfectly into BEHAVIOR because there are explicit thoughts and a specific method, but no completed past action. It's not ATTEMPT because no action was taken. It's not IDEATION because a specific method is mentioned.

**Final Classification:** The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself"") combined with a specific method (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"") places this in the BEHAVIOR category. The explicit statement that the person ""can never bring myself to actually do it"" confirms it is not an ATTEMPT.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""kill me,"" ""please come here,"" ""i'll dm the address"" indicate immediate and current intent/desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Method:** The method is to be murdered by another person (""kill me,"" ""murder me""). While unconventional, it is a specific method of death being requested.
    *   **Location:** ""i'll dm the address, please come here"" specifies a location where the requested act should take place.
    *   **Preparations:** Offering to DM the address and begging someone to come and murder them constitutes a preparation for the requested act of ending their life.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present, so not INDICATOR.

    *   It is not a description of a past completed suicide attempt.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**

    *   ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time."" - Explicit mention of ""dying.""
    *   ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen."" - Explicitly refers to ""make it happen"" in the context of ending life (suicide), even if disavowing intent. This counts as explicit mention of suicide.
    *   ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"" - This is an explicit expression of wanting life to end or not wanting to be alive, aligning with ""not wanting to be alive"" or ""want it to be over"" from the framework.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time."" - Ongoing feeling.
    *   ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore."" - Ongoing feeling.
    *   No immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons) are mentioned.
    *   No specific locations (bridges, buildings, train tracks) are mentioned.
    *   No preparations (notes, acquiring means, specific setups) are described.
    *   No research or seeking information about methods is mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No past attempts are mentioned.
    *   No interrupted attempts are mentioned.
    *   No self-harm behaviors are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""dying,"" ""make it happen"" referring to suicide, ""better if I didn't have to try anymore"" implying desire for cessation of life).
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is described.

    Based on the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""
    The critical rule ""Even if someone says 'my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to,' this is still IDEATION because suicide is explicitly mentioned"" applies here, as the user states ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" after mentioning not being afraid of dying and wishing things would be over. This explicitly mentions the concept of suicide while disavowing immediate intent, which falls under IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""i still thought about suicide"". The phrase ""i just want to collapse and let go"" in the context of increasing suicidal thoughts is an explicit expression of wanting to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""today is the anniversary"", ""now it's like i'm back to square one"", ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" indicate current and escalating distress. ""i just want to collapse and let go"" indicates a current desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""suicidal thoughts"", ""want to collapse and let go"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation: No.
    *   Past suicide attempt: No.
    *   This aligns with the definition of IDEATION: explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or method. The rule about ""Intrusive Thoughts"" also confirms this, as explicit mention of suicide, even if not acted upon, falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicit. ""want to collapse and let go"" is explicit in this context.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" which directly fits this rule, classifying it as IDEATION.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** Focus is on current and escalating thoughts.
*   **When in Doubt:** Fits IDEATION perfectly as there are explicit thoughts but no plan/method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""planning to kill myself tonight"" and ends with ""Rest In Peace ya'll"", which are clear mentions of suicide and death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tonight"" and ""now"" indicate immediate and current intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""I am planning to kill myself tonight"" indicates a specific plan to act, even if the method isn't detailed. The *act of planning* to commit suicide *tonight* is a strong indicator of a specific plan/preparation for action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes (""planning to kill myself tonight"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation? Yes, ""planning to kill myself tonight"" constitutes a specific plan to act, and the timing (""tonight"") adds to the urgency and concreteness of the plan. This goes beyond mere ideation into the realm of active planning.
    *   Therefore, it falls under BEHAVIOR. The critical rule ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned"" applies here, as ""planning to kill myself tonight"" is a plan.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing."" It also includes ""I don't belong here. I need to leave,"" which, in context, strongly implies a desire to end their existence.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm starting to think suicide is the only thing..."" indicates a current and ongoing thought process. ""I need to leave"" indicates a current desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. There is no mention of research or seeking information about methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are described as having occurred. The ""make myself suffer extraordinary pain"" is a desire, not a described action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicide is the only thing""). However, there is NO mention of a plan, method, or preparation. Based on the decision logic, this points to IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""suicide is the only thing..."" is explicit. ""I need to leave"" is an explicit death wish in context.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""suicide"" clearly places it beyond INDICATOR. The *absence* of any plan or method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR.

Therefore, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""practicing hanging myself"", ""when I finally do it"", ""deserves to die"", ""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy"", and ""this pain... will be over soon"". All are explicit mentions of suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I've been practicing"" indicates ongoing current action. ""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it"" and ""will be over soon"" indicate future intent with strong anticipation. ""I'm going to keep practicing"" indicates ongoing preparation.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""hanging myself"" is a specific method. ""practicing"" and ""train myself to break this natural survival instinct"" are specific preparations and actions towards the plan.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The user describes ""practicing hanging myself"". This is an action taken, but the context ""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it"" and ""I'm going to keep practicing, train myself... and I will succeed"" clarifies that the *actual* suicide attempt is still in the future. The ""practicing"" is a preparation/rehearsal, not a completed attempt. According to Critical Rule 3, ""If someone describes putting a noose around their neck... but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" The ""practicing"" fits this description of an initiated action or preparation.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: YES.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation: YES (""practicing hanging myself"" is both a method and a preparation/action).
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action): NO. The ""practicing"" is a preparation for a future attempt, not a completed past attempt.

    Based on the rules, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods/preparations (the practicing itself) classifies this as BEHAVIOR. It's not ATTEMPT because the final act is stated as future (""when I finally do it"").

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states: ""I attempted suicide last week"" and ""(Un)fortunately my attempt had failed."" This clearly indicates a past completed suicide attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post describes a past suicide attempt (""I attempted suicide last week"").
    *   According to the rules, ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT.""
    *   The rule also states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" In this case, a past attempt is mentioned alongside current ideation (""I want to take my life""). The presence of the past completed action takes precedence.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" indicates an immediate or very recent action has occurred. The question ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" also implies current intent or research related to an ongoing situation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""Valium"" is a specific method (pills). The question ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" is research about a specific method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The crucial phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" directly implies that the person *has already taken* valium with the intent to die. This describes a concrete action that has occurred.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts: Yes.
    *   Plan/method: Yes (valium).
    *   Action taken: Yes, the person has taken valium. This is a completed action with intent to die.

    Applying the Critical Classification Rules:
    *   The post describes a ""concrete action that occurred in the past"" (taking valium) ""with intent to die, regardless of outcome."" This directly matches the definition of **ATTEMPT**.

I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I don't want to live at all,"" ""Some of these are suicide attempts,"" and refers to ""my suicide note."" It details actions taken with suicidal intent.

These are all in the past tense. There are no *current* plans or methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post details multiple *past completed suicide attempts*:

    *   Slicing ""hard and fast across my neck"" with a straight razor.
    *   Taking ""every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived.""
    These are concrete actions taken with intent to die.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post explicitly describes multiple ""past completed suicide attempts"" (e.g., ""swallowed every single one,"" ""sliced hard and fast across my neck,"" ""made a cocktail, and survived""). According to the definition, ""ATTEMPT: Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome."" The critical rule ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT"" applies directly. The motorcycle incident is explicitly stated as *not* being a suicide attempt, but the preceding events clearly are.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit mentions of suicide and detailed descriptions of actions taken with suicidal intent.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** While the razor attempt ""barely penetrated the skin,"" the pill overdoses are described as completed actions (""swallowed every single one,"" ""took every prescription...made a cocktail""). The definition of ATTEMPT includes ""actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome.""

I am so stressed out over everything, my business is just about to fail. We have work, but it's all on reputation I've built over the years. I'm fucking everything up now. I'm ready to be done. I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying. I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself."" It also says ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it,"" and ""I just need someone to push me one more inch,"" all clearly indicating suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""tonight"" refers to the action taken, indicating very recent and current urgency. ""I'm ready to be done"" and ""I'm so close to just doing it"" indicate immediate and ongoing suicidal ideation and proximity to action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes a specific method and location: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight."" This is a clear plan and initiation of a method (hanging/strangulation).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes an action that was initiated but stopped: ""Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This is an interrupted attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts: Yes.
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes, a specific method and action were described.
    *   Action history: An interrupted attempt is described.
    *   According to the Critical Classification Rules, ""If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" The user initiated the action with the belt but stopped, fitting the definition of BEHAVIOR.

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific method and location, and describes an initiated but interrupted action, which per the rules, classifies as BEHAVIOR.

98,scared. too scared to kill myself but too tired of life. plus suicide is illegal here so if i fail i might get arrested or fined for it . fun,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" multiple times (""too scared to kill myself,"" ""suicide is illegal here,"" ""if i fail""). It also implies a desire to end life with ""too tired of life.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language indicates current feelings and thoughts (""scared,"" ""too tired of life""). There are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but the thoughts are present.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research. The post discusses the *idea* of suicide and barriers to it, but not *how* it would be done.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes *are* mentioned (""kill myself"", ""suicide""). So, not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts *are* present (""kill myself"", ""suicide""), and there is NO plan/method. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan/method, so not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no past completed action, so not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The phrase ""too scared to kill myself"" still confirms the explicit mention of suicide, even if the person states a deterrent. This fits the rule that explicit mention of suicide leads to IDEATION.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" clearly moves it past INDICATOR. The lack of any method or plan keeps it from being BEHAVIOR.

Therefore, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method.

This isn't fucking living. We are rotting away and people are acting indifferent to these facts. They consume the news and stuff of the media making themselves ignorant to the basic fact that human life has no fucking purpose other than living as a slave to make the rich richer and to slowly decay. We start dying the second we are born. This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good. So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""This will be my second to last post"" and ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" These are direct and explicit expressions of intent to end their life. ""End this bullshit for good"" in this context clearly refers to ending their life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""This will be my second to last post"" indicates immediate future action. ""taking a trip in April"" provides a specific timeframe for the planned action.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" indicates a specific plan involving travel and a timeframe. While a specific *method* like ""pills"" or ""jumping"" isn't named, the ""trip"" itself is presented as a planned action *leading to* the end of life, which constitutes a preparation or specific plan. It's not just a thought; it's a scheduled event with a clear, stated purpose.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end this bullshit for good"", ""second to last post"").
    *   A specific plan/preparation is present (""taking a trip in April""). This is more than just ideation because it involves a concrete, timed plan of action.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""end this bullshit for good"" and ""second to last post"" are explicit.
*   **Past vs. Present:** This describes a future planned action.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts *and* a specific, timed plan (""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"") pushes it beyond IDEATION into BEHAVIOR. It's not an ATTEMPT because it's a future plan, not a past completed action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit mentions of wanting to die: ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"". ""Od on meds"" is a direct reference to overdose, a means of suicide. ""Get hit by a car"" is also a death wish.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""i just wish i could"" indicates a current desire or thought.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** Specific methods are mentioned: ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"". While not a concrete plan to *act* *now*, these are specific methods being considered or wished for.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of past attempts or interrupted actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds"") AND specific methods (""get hit by a car"", ""od on meds""). This aligns with the BEHAVIOR category. It's not ATTEMPT because no past action is described. It's not IDEATION because specific methods are mentioned. It's not INDICATOR because suicide/death wishes are explicit.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds"" is explicit.
*   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Specific methods are mentioned (""od on meds"", ""get hit by a car""), pushing it to BEHAVIOR.
*   Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: No past completed action is described, only current wishes for methods.

Being unwanted in literally all facets of life from growing up to adulthood. If youre attractive the world is literally your oyster, I would never stop smiling I was born that way.

I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses extreme distress, self-loathing, and the ""daily torture of living life"" due to perceived unattractiveness. However, it *does not* contain any explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive. The phrase ""I would fucking jump out of bed"" is used in a hypothetical positive context (if they were attractive), not as a suicidal action.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** No urgency or timing indicators related to suicide. The distress is ongoing (""daily torture"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm behaviors are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life (""daily torture of living life"", ""Being unwanted""). However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide or death wishes*. According to the decision logic, ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** There are no explicit or implicit expressions of wanting to die or be gone. The distress is about the *quality of life* as perceived, not a desire to *end* life.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: There is no explicit death/suicide mention, so it falls into INDICATOR.

The post describes profound suffering and a desire for a different life, but not an explicit desire for death.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""me being suicidal"" and ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" indicates past actions (""tried""). There is no indication of immediate or current intent to act, but rather a reflection on past attempts and frustration with others' reactions.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No current plan or method for a *future* suicide attempt is mentioned. The focus is on past actions.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The statement ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" is a direct description of past suicide attempts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ATTEMPT'.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes concrete past actions taken with the intent to die (""tried to kill myself 8 times""). This fits the definition of 'ATTEMPT'. The presence of past attempts overrides other categories if they are the primary focus.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""i'm better off dead"" is an explicit expression of wanting to be dead, which falls under the criteria of ""wanting to die"" or ""being dead.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""when i say i'm better off dead"" indicates an ongoing or general thought/statement, not immediate urgency, but the core statement is a direct death wish.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""i'm better off dead"").
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is described.
    *   According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

*   ""When in Doubt"": Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION because there is explicit death mention. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION because there is no plan/method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""overdose help please"" and ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"". While the user states ""i dont think i want to die"" *now*, the action described (taking 44 paracetamol) is a clear overdose, which is a method of suicide. The context of asking for ""help"" and describing severe symptoms (""stomach is hurting very badly"", ""sweating badly and shaking"") indicates a life-threatening situation resulting from a self-initiated action. This action is a completed attempt.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""almost an hour ago"" indicates a very recent past event with immediate, ongoing consequences. The person is currently experiencing severe symptoms and is asking for help *now*.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method (""44 paracetamol"") and quantity are mentioned. This method was already executed.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" is a direct description of a past completed action (an overdose). This is a concrete action that occurred.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a past suicide attempt. The critical rule states: ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT"". Even if the person expresses ambivalence about dying *now*, the action itself was a completed attempt. This is not merely ideation or behavior; it is a described past action with intent to harm oneself.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The action of taking 44 paracetamol is an explicit action, an overdose, which is a common suicide method.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** This was *not* an interrupted action. The pills were taken, and the person is experiencing the consequences.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post clearly describes a *past* completed action (""I took..."").
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly fits the ""ATTEMPT"" category as a concrete action was taken in the past.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I want to end it"" indicates a current desire. The phrase ""I have no idea how, when or anything else"" indicates a lack of immediate plan or timing, but the desire is present.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" which means there is no specific plan, method, location, or preparations mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I want to end it"") but explicitly states there is no plan or method (""I have no idea how""). According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""nothing lower but death"" in the context of hitting rock bottom, but this is a general philosophical statement about the lowest point before improvement, not an explicit wish for death for the poster. The overall tone is positive, focusing on improvement, acceptance, and hope. There are no explicit mentions of wanting to die, kill oneself, or end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** No immediate or current indicators of suicidal intent. The past struggles are framed as something the user has overcome (""these last 2 years since i've been way better tho"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past suicide attempts are described. The ""rock bottom"" involved ""bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday,"" not a suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post expresses distress (""feeling lonely and lost"") but explicitly states improvement and hope (""overall better,"" ""might get better,"" ""always a way to improve,"" ""find a way to stay positive""). There is no explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die for the person writing the post.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""plan on ending it soon"" and ""overdosibg on ibuprofen is painful or would work but thats likely my go-to plan."" This clearly identifies suicidal intent and a desire to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""soon"", ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon"" indicates a current consideration and potential timeframe, even if uncertain.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself."" This is a clear expression of wanting to end one's life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The distress is current (""now I feel like shit,"" ""right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future""), indicating immediate and anticipated future distress. The desire to kill oneself is presented as a current thought, conditional on having the means.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method, ""gun,"" is mentioned. Although it's conditional (""If I had a gun""), the identification of a specific means for suicide qualifies as a method assessment. It's not just a general wish to die, but a specific way of dying is considered.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past completed suicide attempts. ""I know how this goes for me"" suggests a history of distress or suicidal ideation, but not concrete past attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I'd kill myself"") AND mentions a specific method (""gun""). According to the framework, this aligns with BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""move on from this worthless existence,"" which clearly indicates suicidal intent and desire for death.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""My last time posting on this account,"" ""plan on doing it next week,"" and ""excited to finally move on"" indicate a current decision with a specific future timeline.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly states ""I've got a suicide plan"" and ""finally got a plan on how i can kill myself."" While the specific *details* of the method are not provided (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping""), the critical point for BEHAVIOR classification is the *existence* of a specific plan. The user affirms they have a plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm. The focus is on a future planned action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present. A specific plan is explicitly stated to exist (""I've got a suicide plan,"" ""a plan on how i can kill myself""). This matches the criteria for BEHAVIOR: ""Posts with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans"". It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described. It is not IDEATION because a plan is explicitly mentioned, not just a wish to die.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit suicide content is present.
*   The post describes a *current* state of having a plan for a *future* action.
*   The key differentiator from IDEATION is the explicit mention of ""a suicide plan"" and ""a plan on how i can kill myself."" This indicates a concrete step beyond just wishing for death.
*   No past completed attempts are mentioned, so it's not ATTEMPT.
*   The presence of a stated plan firmly places it in BEHAVIOR.

I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts"" and ""I have attempted suicide in the past"". It also mentions ""I've begun having those thoughts again."" This clearly identifies suicide-related content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I've begun having those thoughts again"" indicates current recurrence of suicidal thoughts. ""attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"" indicates a past event.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions current ""suicidal thoughts"" but *does not* describe any specific current plans, methods, locations, or preparations for suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This is a clear description of a past completed suicide attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" would point to IDEATION.
    *   However, the explicit mention of a ""past suicide attempt"" is the most severe classification according to the framework.
    *   The rule ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT"" is directly met.
    *   Also, the rule ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT"" (or in this case, current thoughts) reinforces this.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   The post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""attempted suicide"".
*   The key factor is the clear statement of a *past completed suicide attempt*. This overrides current thoughts or lack of a current plan, as per the definition of ATTEMPT and the ""When in Doubt"" rule (Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions).

It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""killing self,"" ""ending life,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""being dead,"" or ""not wanting to be alive.""
    *   No phrases like ""going to die,"" ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" or ""want it to be over"" in a suicidal context. ""It's getting to be too much"" indicates distress but not explicit death wishes.
    *   The post mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) and ""I can't even cut."" While self-harm is a serious behavior, the framework's ""SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION"" specifically looks for *suicide* or *death* wishes. Self-harm is listed under ""ACTION HISTORY"" but not as a direct trigger for ""suicide content"" in the first step of the analysis. The post does not explicitly state these self-harm thoughts are linked to a desire to die.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""It's getting to be too much"" indicates current, ongoing distress.
    *   ""I can't even cut because my bf will see"" indicates a current desire for a coping mechanism that is being prevented.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific suicide plan or method is mentioned.
    *   ""Cutting"" is mentioned, but as a desired coping mechanism (""cope in the way that works best""), not as a method for suicide, nor is it a plan for suicide. The person states they *cannot* cut.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""thoughts of sh"" and ""I can't even cut"" indicate a history or current desire for self-harm. However, the post does not describe a *completed* self-harm action (which would be relevant for ATTEMPT) nor an *interrupted* self-harm action (which could be BEHAVIOR if linked to suicidal intent). It describes an inability to perform a desired coping mechanism.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and problems coping (""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""I have so many issues,"" ""It's getting to be too much"").
    *   There is NO explicit mention of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life.
    *   The mention of ""thoughts of sh"" and the desire to ""cut"" indicates a high level of distress and a problematic coping mechanism, but it does not cross the threshold into explicit *suicidal* ideation as defined by the prompt (which requires explicit death/suicide wishes).
    *   According to the ""Critical Classification Rules,"" specifically ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention."" Since there is no explicit death/suicide mention, it remains in the INDICATOR category. The post fits the definition of INDICATOR: ""Posts expressing distress, hopelessness, or general dissatisfaction with life WITHOUT any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die.""

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""when I die"", ""my pain is finally over"", and ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" These are clear expressions of wanting to die and not wanting to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""when I die"" suggests a future event, but it's presented as a desired outcome. No immediate urgency like ""tonight"" or ""now.""
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I die"", ""I'm dead"") but does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the definition of IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I die"" and ""I'm dead"" are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of death places it firmly in IDEATION over INDICATOR. The lack of plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"" and ""I don't want to live."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I finally decided"" and ""goodbye"" indicate a current, immediate decision and intent to act. The phrase ""helped me stay here about a month longer"" refers to a past delay, but the current statement signifies the end of that delay and a present decision.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""take the leap"" is a common euphemism for jumping, which is a specific method of suicide. While not explicitly stating ""I will jump from a bridge,"" ""take the leap"" in the context of ""kill myself"" serves as a specific method indicator.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of a past completed suicide attempt. The ""helped me stay here"" part refers to past ideation or intent, not an attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"", ""don't want to live"").
    *   A specific method is indicated (""take the leap"" implies jumping).
    *   No past completed attempt is described.
    *   According to the rules, if explicit suicide thoughts AND a plan/method are present, it falls under BEHAVIOR. ""Take the leap"" qualifies as a specific method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""before i end it all"" and ""before i call it quits,"" and ""it's finally ending,"" which are clear expressions of wanting to end their life. The phrase ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"" and ""Goodbye"" further reinforce this.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""one last time before i end it all"" and ""before i call it quits"" indicate an immediate or very near-future intent. ""finally ending"" suggests a current state of resolution.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions playing a video game ""one last time"" as an activity *before* ending it, but it does *not* specify any method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, or preparation *for the act of suicide itself*. There's no mention of acquiring means, writing notes, or researching methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end it all"", ""call it quits""). However, there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation for the *act* of suicide mentioned. Therefore, it falls under IDEATION.
    *   It's not INDICATOR because there are explicit death wishes.
    *   It's not BEHAVIOR because no specific method or plan for the suicide act is given. Playing a game ""one last time"" is a pre-suicidal behavior, but not a *method* or *plan* for the suicide itself according to the framework's definition of ""specific plans, methods, preparations.""
    *   It's not ATTEMPT as no past completed action is described.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""she had tried to kill herself,"" but this refers to a *different person* (the friend on Reddit), not the person writing the post. The person writing the post expresses ""I need help,"" ""I'm scared,"" and concern for their friend, but no desire to end their own life or any suicidal thoughts for themselves.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The urgency (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") relates to the user's concern for their friend, not their own suicidal intent. The past event (""she had tried to kill herself"") is attributed to the friend.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any plan or method for suicide by the person writing the post.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors by the person writing the post. The attempt mentioned is by the friend.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The person writing the post expresses distress and concern, but there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned for *themselves*. According to the rules, ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned."" Therefore, this falls into the INDICATOR category.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I will hang myself now"" and ""that will kill me with it."" It also expresses ""I don't want to be alone anymore"" in the context of suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The words ""now"" and ""I'm now looking for"" indicate immediate urgency and current action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method is mentioned: ""hang myself."" The user is actively engaged in preparation: ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it."" They are also assessing the method's viability: ""I don't think the thing will break off as I am only 44kg.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore,"" indicating past self-harm, but it does not describe a past *suicide attempt*. The primary focus is on current suicidal intent and preparation.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I will hang myself"") AND specific plans/methods (""hang myself"") AND preparations/seeking means (""looking for something that I can tie""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of BEHAVIOR. It is not ATTEMPT because it describes current intent and active preparation, not a completed past action.

It feels like I am being ripped apart and put back together incorrectly. I can't stop shaking. How am I supposed to live like this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post states, ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This is an explicit *negation* of wanting to die. While the post conveys extreme distress (""shattered,"" ""miserable,"" ""barely function,"" ""can't stop shaking,"" ""How am I supposed to live like this?""), it *does not* contain any explicit mention of wanting to die, kill self, end life, or not wanting to be alive. The phrase ""I want to be gone"" or ""don't want to survive"" is not present. The critical point is the explicit *denial* of wanting to die.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current, ongoing feelings and inability to function (""I feel,"" ""I can barely function,"" ""I can't stop shaking""). There are no indicators of immediate intent related to suicide.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post explicitly *denies* wanting to die (""It's not even that I just want to die"").
    *   According to the framework, ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"". Even though the person is in severe distress, the *absence* (and explicit negation) of a death wish is key.
    *   It does not qualify for IDEATION because it explicitly negates wanting to die.
    *   It does not qualify for BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT as there are no plans, methods, or past actions.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The post explicitly *denies* a death wish.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit denial of wanting to die firmly places this in INDICATOR, despite the high level of distress. It does not meet the criteria for IDEATION because it lacks an *explicit expression* of wanting to die.

Therefore, the post fits the definition of **INDICATOR** as it expresses severe distress and hopelessness *without* any explicit mention or desire for suicide or death.

Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (likely ""die"" or ""do it"" in a suicidal context), mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" and discusses ""suicidal courage and determination to get on with it."" It also uses phrases like ""If you change your mind and you want to do it"" (referring to suicide) and ""Go out with bang, and big flames,"" which are euphemisms for a dramatic end.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes specific methods and preparations:
    *   ""With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem"" - Suggests a specific means for a destructive act.
    *   ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also."" - This is a clear instruction to research and acquire means for a highly dangerous method (making explosives). This fits ""seeking information about suicide methods"" or ""preparations.""
    *   ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" - This identifies a specific location and suggests an action (""do your best"") in conjunction with the destructive methods, implying a planned destructive act.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past *completed* suicide attempts by the person writing the post. The phrase ""You will never do it so calm down"" is a dismissal of past *inaction*, not a description of a past attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I WANT TO DOIE"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""want to do it"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, and preparations are mentioned (""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters,"" ""making nitroglycerin,"" ""research where to find the parts,"" ""power plants"").

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I WANT TO DOIE"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** While ""suicidal thoughts are a cope"" is mentioned, the post then moves beyond thoughts to actively suggesting and detailing methods/plans.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The methods/plans are presented as current possibilities/advice for future action.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts *and* specific methods/preparations clearly points to BEHAVIOR over IDEATION. It's not ATTEMPT as no completed past action is described.

I've thought about it all day and throughout I've tried to be happy and loud so they wouldn't worry, so they wouldn't know what I was really thinking. I'm scared right now but I know I'll wake up. I'm sad right now and I want nothing more than someone to sit with me in silence while I cry. But I'm alone. I can't reach out. So all I ask is this, please check up on me later. I can feel myself falling asleep, but as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up. I just want to be checked up on, but I don't want to bother my friends with it. Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""I'm at the end of my rope right now."" - Indicates severe distress.
    *   ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through."" - ""Go all the way through"" strongly implies completing a suicidal act.
    *   ""I know I'll wake up later, and while I know this..."" - Suggests an action has been taken (e.g., ingested something) that will lead to unconsciousness/sleep, but not death.
    *   ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" - Explicit wish for death.
    *   ""I've thought about it all day"" - Refers to suicidal thoughts.
    *   Explicit suicidal thoughts and implied actions are present.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""right now"" - Current state.
    *   ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I can feel myself falling asleep"" - Describes current physical effects of an ongoing or recently initiated action.
    *   ""I knew this morning... it would lead to this."" - Past prediction leading to current state.
    *   ""as I've done this before"" - Reference to past similar actions.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No explicit method name (e.g., ""pills"").
    *   However, the physical descriptions (""breath slowing down,"" ""chest hurting,"" ""falling asleep,"" ""I know I'll wake up later"") strongly imply an action has been taken that induces these effects, likely an ingestion of some substance. This constitutes an *initiated action* or *preparation* by taking means.
    *   ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through"" implies the current action is *intended* to be lethal, but the user is hesitating or expects to survive.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I know this is going to be another failure"" - Implies past actions that were not fatal.
    *   ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" - Explicitly states a past action similar to the current one, which did not result in death. These are past *behaviors*, not completed *attempts* as defined.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit death wishes (""hope I don't wake up"") and strong implications of an initiated action (""feel my breath slowing down,"" ""falling asleep""). This moves it beyond INDICATOR and IDEATION.
    *   The user is describing a *current* action that has been initiated (implied method via physical effects) and has suicidal intent (""hope I don't wake up"").
    *   The user states ""I know I'll wake up later"" and ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through,"" indicating that while an action is taken, they expect to survive or are hesitating to complete it lethally.
    *   According to the Critical Classification Rules: ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" The current situation fits this: an action has been initiated (implied ingestion leading to physical effects), but the user expects to survive, suggesting it's an interrupted or non-lethal action.
    *   Past actions are mentioned (""done this before""), but they are also described as non-fatal (""I know I'll wake up""), so they are past *behaviors*, not *completed attempts*.
    *   Therefore, the current situation, which involves an initiated action with suicidal intent but an expectation of survival, falls under BEHAVIOR.

126,"It's time. Been writing here since June, with the intent to kill myself. I never did it.I have no idea why. Fear of death? I don't think so. Fear of missing out on certain experiences? I have already missed out on so much, so no. I don't think I was ready yet. Not until now. I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side, not sure what will happen once I post this. I could die, or the attempt could fail.but it all doesn't matter to me. The risk is worth the reward. I am not giving myself anymore chances, and I am not going to make any excuses anymore, I am going to shoot myself. I don't think I will delete this account - I want people to see what true failure is. Every other account is gone, deleted. I have no more savings, my room is empty, everything is gone. Too late to turn back now!. To the people who tried to help - thank you. I personally believe you should've never given me your time, but thanks. I hope you guys live long, successful lives. I hope you don't make mistakes like me. Please take care of yourselves. Please give yourselves chances. I know after I am done doing what I need to do, I won't have anymore chances. I have ran out of chances. Goodbye.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""intent to kill myself,"" ""I could die,"" and ""I am going to shoot myself."" It also uses phrases like ""It's time"" and ""Goodbye"" in a context of imminent self-harm. This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""It's time,"" ""Not until now,"" ""I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side,"" ""I am not giving myself anymore chances,"" and ""Too late to turn back now!"" demonstrate extreme urgency and indicate an immediate, current, and imminent action.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post clearly states a specific method: ""a loaded gun by my side"" and a specific action: ""I am going to shoot myself."" This constitutes a clear plan and method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""I never did it"" in reference to past intent, indicating no *completed* past attempts. The current content describes an *imminent* action, not a past completed one.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned. (Not INDICATOR)
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND a specific plan/method/preparation are present (""loaded gun,"" ""shoot myself""). This points towards BEHAVIOR.
    *   The post describes an *imminent* action and preparation, not a *past completed* suicide attempt. (Not ATTEMPT)

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The suicidal intent and method are explicit.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The focus is entirely on the present moment and an imminent, planned action.
*   **BEHAVIOR vs. ATTEMPT:** The post describes having the means (loaded gun) and the stated intent to act *now* (""I am going to shoot myself""). It is not describing a past completed action. This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR perfectly.

Therefore, the post falls under the BEHAVIOR category.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal episodes,"" ""leave a note for my parents saying its my last time with them,"" and ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it, i thought that was the last breath i have."" This clearly indicates suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The key event occurred ""a week ago."" The post describes a past action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method is described: ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it."" A preparation is also mentioned: ""leave a note for my parents.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a completed action: ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it."" The phrase ""luckily i vomited"" indicates the action was taken, but the desired outcome (death) was not achieved, which aligns with the definition of an attempt regardless of outcome.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a past, completed action taken with intent to die (swallowing bleach after leaving a note). This directly fits the ""ATTEMPT"" category. It's not just ideation (explicit thoughts without plan/method) or behavior (plan/method/preparations or interrupted action), but a concrete action that occurred in the past. The critical rule states: ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT."" Also, ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" In this case, the action (swallowing bleach) was *completed*; the vomiting was a *consequence* of the action, not an interruption *before* the action was fully initiated. Therefore, it's an ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I still want to die"" and ""basically lost all will to live."" These are clear expressions of wanting to die/not wanting to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I still want to die"" indicates a current and ongoing state.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned. The post only describes the desire to die and what is stopping them.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The phrase ""I tried to pull through"" refers to trying to cope with grief, not a suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I still want to die"") but no specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the definition of IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I still want to die"" is an explicit expression of death wishes.
*   No plan or method is present, ruling out BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, ruling out ATTEMPT.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I've only been thinking of suicide for months on end."" It also mentions ""my end will only get nearer"" and ""I'm fine with either outcome,"" which implies an acceptance of death if the acid doesn't help.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""for months on end"" indicates ongoing, persistent thoughts. ""This time I'm deeper than I've ever been"" indicates a current severe state. ""my end will only get nearer"" is a future projection based on a conditional outcome.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""take a few tabs of acid,"" but this is presented as an attempt to *avoid* suicide or cope with the thoughts, not as a suicide method itself. The phrase ""if it doesn't [help], I'll be back in the same spot or worse off than before and my end will only get nearer"" describes a potential *outcome* (death getting nearer) but does not detail *how* that death would occur (no specific method, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past suicide attempts or self-harm actions are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""thinking of suicide"").
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation for *suicide* is described. The acid is a coping mechanism. The ""end"" is a vague outcome, not a planned action with a method.
    *   Therefore, it falls into IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit mention of suicide is present.
*   No specific method or plan for suicide is detailed, only the thoughts and a conditional acceptance of a future outcome. The acid is not a suicide method in this context.
*   No past completed attempt is described.

Based on the rules, the explicit mention of ""thinking of suicide"" without a specific plan or method leads to IDEATION. The mention of ""my end will only get nearer"" is a strong expression of death wishes, but still lacks the specific *how* to qualify as BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses distress (""hit a new low,"" ""haven't felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do"") and harmful coping mechanisms (stole hydrocodone, drank alcohol) to ""feel ok for one night."" However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, ending life, or any similar phrases. The intent of taking hydrocodone is stated as ""just to feel ok for one night,"" which is about temporary relief, not ending life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tonight,"" ""in a while"" indicate current distress and ongoing issues.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""hydrocodone"" and ""drink,"" but these are explicitly stated as being taken ""just to feel ok for one night,"" not as a plan or method for suicide. There is no indication of suicidal intent associated with these substances.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The user describes taking hydrocodone and drinking, but this is presented as a coping mechanism (""to feel ok""), not as a past suicide attempt or self-harm with suicidal intent.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, even though there is significant distress and harmful coping, it falls into the INDICATOR category. The critical rule ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"" applies here. The substance use is for coping, not for suicidal intent.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" is a strong expression of hopelessness and directly implies not wanting to be alive. According to the critical rules, phrases like ""I want to be gone"" are explicit expressions of death wishes. ""I see no point in living anymore"" falls into this category, indicating an explicit wish not to continue living, which is equivalent to ""I don't want to be alive.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""anymore"" indicates a current, ongoing state. There are no immediate (""now"", ""tonight"") or past (""I tried"") indicators.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations, or research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post *does* contain explicit suicide/death wishes (""I see no point in living anymore"" is interpreted as ""I don't want to be alive""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   It contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I see no point in living anymore"") but NO plan/method. This aligns perfectly with the definition of IDEATION.
    *   It does not contain a plan/method, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   It does not describe a past completed attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I see no point in living anymore"" is treated as an explicit expression of a death wish, moving it beyond INDICATOR.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION because there is an explicit death/suicide mention (not wanting to be alive). Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION because no method/plan is mentioned.

Therefore, the post fits the definition of IDEATION.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes an action that has already occurred in the past relative to the time of writing the post. The consequence (""might not wake up tomorrow"") refers to the potential outcome of this past action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method is mentioned: ""pills."" The quantity ""a fuck load"" further specifies the method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""planning out my suicide,"" ""intend to do it right this time,"" ""I will go through with this,"" and ""can't find a reason...to continue living."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm planning out my suicide"" indicates current planning. ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest"" provides a specific future timing, indicating a concrete plan. ""I will go through with this"" shows strong determination.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""I'm planning out my suicide"" directly indicates planning. While a specific method isn't named, the act of planning and the specific future date (January 1st) constitute preparation and a developing plan. The phrase ""intend to do it right this time"" also implies a method is being considered or refined from a previous attempt.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" explicitly states a past suicide attempt. This is a crucial detail.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A plan/preparation is explicitly mentioned (""planning out my suicide,"" specific date).

**Final Classification Rule Check:**

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""do not want to live anymore,"" ""scared to kill myself,"" ""hate being alive,"" and ""wish i was never born."" It also says ""sometimes i wonder if i should just do it now,"" referring to suicide. All these are explicit mentions of suicide or wanting to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""100% do not want to live anymore"" indicates a current and strong desire. ""sometimes i wonder if i should just do it now"" indicates current contemplation of immediate action. ""For now i guess i will just sit here"" indicates a current state of distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase ""scared to kill myself"" suggests a lack of immediate intent to act on thoughts, despite the contemplation.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""do not want to live anymore,"" ""kill myself,"" ""hate being alive,"" ""wish i was never born""). However, there is NO mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, according to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases are explicit expressions of death wishes and suicidal thoughts.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** ""scared to kill myself"" confirms the thought is present, even if action is inhibited by fear. This is still IDEATION.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** No interrupted actions are described.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post focuses on current feelings and contemplation.
*   **When in Doubt:** It's clearly beyond INDICATOR due to explicit mentions. It does not contain a plan/method, so it's not BEHAVIOR. It's not ATTEMPT as no past completed action is described. Therefore, IDEATION is the correct category.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""frequently"" indicates an ongoing or repeated action. ""i hang myself"" describes a current/repeated action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""i hang myself"" specifies the method (hanging). ""leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto"" describes a specific detail of the action and a means of interruption.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently"" describes past, repeated actions. The description ""i hang myself but always leave a chair... so i don't die"" clearly indicates an action that was initiated but stopped or not carried through to completion with fatal intent.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide content and a specific method, ruling out INDICATOR and IDEATION.
    *   The critical rule regarding ""Interrupted Actions"" states: ""If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT.""

It also says, ""I see no point anymore,"" and ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me."" These are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post mentions ongoing suicidal feelings (""been suicidal for about 6 years"") and current feelings (""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore""). It also details a past event: ""i had an attempt when I was 14.""

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does *not* mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, or research for a *current* suicide attempt. The phrase ""I can't go even if I want to"" implies a desire to end life but an inability to act, rather than a plan.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states, ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out."" This is a clear description of a past completed suicide attempt. It also mentions ""a few close calls but never succeed"" after that, which could be interpreted as interrupted attempts or near-attempts, but the primary mention is the past completed attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide content is present.
    *   No current plan/method is present.
    *   A past completed suicide attempt is explicitly described (""i had an attempt when I was 14"").
    *   According to the ""Critical Classification Rules,"" if a post describes a past suicide attempt (completed action), it should be classified as ATTEMPT.

138,One of these days I'll finally do it. I'm not afraid of killing myself anymore I've done it many times and I figured out how to properly hang myself but at the moment there is too much potential interference. I'll break killing myself regardless.I just wish I could die in my sleep instead. Maybe I'll get lucky and increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" multiple times, ""die in my sleep,"" and ""I'll finally do it"" in the context of ending life. This confirms explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""One of these days I'll finally do it"" - Future intent.
    *   ""at the moment there is too much potential interference"" - Current obstacle, but intent remains.
    *   ""I'll break killing myself regardless"" - Strong future intent.
    *   ""I've done it many times"" - Past actions/attempts.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""I figured out how to properly hang myself"" - This is a specific method identified and understood, indicating a plan/preparation.
    *   ""if I start cutting again"" - While cutting is self-harm, here it's linked to increasing chances of death, showing a willingness to engage in harmful behaviors.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I've done it many times"" - This is a direct statement of past completed suicide attempts. This is a key indicator for the ATTEMPT category.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts: Yes.
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes (""figured out how to properly hang myself"").
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action): Yes (""I've done it many times"").

    *   **Critical Classification Rule Application:** The post explicitly states ""I've done it many times,"" which refers to past completed suicide attempts. The rule states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" This post contains both past attempts and current plans/intent. Therefore, ATTEMPT is the correct classification.

Like I'm feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all"" explicitly mentions ending life, which is a form of suicide content. ""Feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing"" reinforces a desire for non-existence.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The thoughts are described as ""For over the course of a year I've been having some thoughts,"" indicating ongoing ideation. The current distress (""Currently 8:26 am, I haven't slept"") provides context but doesn't change the nature of the suicidal thoughts.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""end it all"") but lacks any mention of a plan or method. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""End it all"" is an explicit expression of a death wish.
*   The mention of ""thoughts... telling me to end it all"" aligns with the ""Intrusive Thoughts"" rule, still classifying it as IDEATION.
*   No plan or past action is described, so it doesn't escalate to BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT.
*   When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION because there is an explicit death/suicide mention.

140,"Just another rant. Keep scrolling. Don't waste your time on a lost cause. I'm almost 30. Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time. I am just a  Useless, shameless, pathetic loser.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and actions: ""Why should I still live"", ""I tried to drown myself"", ""I tried to hang"", ""I even tried to jump off"".
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The mentions are of past actions (""I tried to..."") and a current questioning of life (""Why should I still live"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** Specific methods are mentioned: ""drown myself"", ""hang"", ""jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in"". A specific location is also mentioned (""4th floor of the building I live in"").
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes past actions that were initiated: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off"". Crucially, it states, ""But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time."" This indicates these were *interrupted attempts* – actions that were started but stopped.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""Why should I still live"").
    *   Specific plans/methods/locations are mentioned (drowning, hanging, jumping from 4th floor).
    *   The actions described were *initiated* but *not completed* (""chickened out"").
    *   According to Critical Classification Rule 3: ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT.""
    *   The post perfectly fits the definition of BEHAVIOR: explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods/preparations, including interrupted attempts where action was initiated. It is not ATTEMPT because the actions were not completed.

I might actually get the courage to do it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""Living is not for me"" - Implies not wanting to be alive.
    *   ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old."" - Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""gone"" in the context of ending life.
    *   ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"" - Explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
    *   ""I might actually get the courage to do it."" - Refers to the act of killing oneself.
    *   *Conclusion:* Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"" - Current feeling, building towards action.
    *   ""I might actually get the courage to do it."" - Indicates a potential future action, driven by current feelings.
    *   ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old."" - Past hypothetical desire, not a past action.
    *   *Conclusion:* Strong current and future-oriented intent is present.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""do it"" but does not provide any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), specific location, or preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means). It only discusses gaining ""courage.""
    *   *Conclusion:* No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old."" - This is a hypothetical statement about a past desire, not a description of an actual past attempt or an interrupted attempt. It states what *would have happened* if it weren't hard, not what *did happen*.
    *   *Conclusion:* No past completed suicide attempts or interrupted attempts are described.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Is there NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? No, there are explicit mentions. So, not INDICATOR.
    *   Are there explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method? Yes, ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"" and ""I might actually get the courage to do it"" are explicit thoughts, and no plan/method is specified. This fits IDEATION.
    *   Are there explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation? No, no plan/method. So, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   Does it describe a past suicide attempt (completed action)? No, the statement about being gone at 15 is hypothetical, not a description of an actual attempt. So, not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit mentions of ""suicide"" and ""kill myself"" are present.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The primary focus is on current feelings and potential future action (""becoming more confident,"" ""might actually get the courage""). The past mention is hypothetical.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly falls into IDEATION as explicit thoughts are present without a plan.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and desires (""kill myself,"" ""get the courage to do it"") but lacks any specific plan, method, or description of a past completed attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""the pain is too much and the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better"" and ""be dead in less than 24 hours"". These are clear expressions of wanting to die/be dead.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""today"" and ""in less than 24 hours"" indicate immediate and urgent timing.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""I have enough Trazodone"" and ""will get alcohol today"". These are specific methods (pills and alcohol) and preparations (acquiring alcohol).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of a past completed suicide attempt. The actions described are planned for the immediate future.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   Specific plans/methods/preparations are present (Trazodone, alcohol, timeframe).
    *   This clearly points to BEHAVIOR. It is not an ATTEMPT as it describes a future action, not a past completed one.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit death wish: Yes (""be dead in less than 24 hours"").
*   Method/Plan: Yes (Trazodone, alcohol, timeframe).
*   Past vs. Present: This is a present plan for a future action, not a past completed attempt. Therefore, it's BEHAVIOR, not ATTEMPT.

Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""I want to give up."" - In the context of severe distress, this is an explicit expression of wanting to end the struggle, which aligns with wanting to end life. The Critical Rule 1 states: ""Phrases like 'I'm going to die soon' or 'I want to be gone' ARE explicit expressions of death wishes when in context of distress."" ""I want to give up"" fits this interpretation.
    *   ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"" - This is an explicit questioning of one's existence, implying a desire not to be alive.
    *   ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" - While not directly ""suicide,"" these statements, especially when coupled with ""I want to give up"" and ""Why am I alive,"" contribute to an explicit expression of desiring non-existence or the end of life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   The post describes current feelings (""I really am tired,"" ""I want to give up,"" ""I feel guilty,"" ""I'm still allowing it to control me""). There are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" for an action, but the distress is current and ongoing.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons) are mentioned.
    *   No specific locations (bridges, buildings, train tracks) are mentioned.
    *   No preparations (notes, acquiring means, specific setups) are mentioned.
    *   No research or seeking information about methods is mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No past attempts are mentioned.
    *   No interrupted attempts are mentioned.
    *   No self-harm behaviors are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are identified (""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive,"" ""My life has no worth. No meaning"").
    *   NO plan/method/preparation is mentioned.
    *   According to the Decision Logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases ""I want to give up"" and ""Why the fuck am I alive"" are considered explicit expressions of wanting to end life/existence given the severe distress described. This aligns with the rule.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit death wishes (as interpreted) means it's not INDICATOR. The absence of a plan/method means it's not BEHAVIOR. Therefore, IDEATION is the correct classification.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" ""if I slowly kill myself this way,"" and ""I'm going to die."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language ""I'm going to,"" ""my new goal weight is,"" ""I might have to go lower,"" and ""if I slowly kill myself this way"" indicates a current, ongoing process with a future fatal intent. It's not a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post details a specific method: ""I have anorexia and I currently weigh 90 pounds, but my new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me."" This is a clear plan involving starvation/anorexia with a specific weight goal as the means to die.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a current state and a future plan/goal (""my new goal weight is 78 pounds,"" ""if I slowly kill myself this way""). It does not describe a past completed suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific plan/method (starvation via anorexia to a target weight) is described.
    *   It is not a description of a *past completed* suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, it falls under the ""BEHAVIOR"" category, as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts AND a specific plan/method/preparations (the goal weight and ongoing anorexia as the means). It's an ongoing, planned action towards suicide, not a past attempt.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method (""charcoal bbq"") and context (""in a tent"") are mentioned. Asking if it's ""possible"" constitutes seeking information about a suicide method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""suicide"") AND mentions a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") while seeking information about its feasibility.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all?

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" - This implies a deadline, and combined with ""I can't do it anymore,"" suggests a potential ending if things don't improve.
    *   ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down."" - This is a clear and explicit metaphor for suicide. ""Put down"" means to euthanize, and the user applies this to themselves (""the ""dog"" put itself down""). This counts as an explicit expression of wanting to end their life.
    *   ""It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down."" - This further confirms the self-directed nature of the ""put down"" metaphor, directly linking it to suicide.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""3 weeks"" - A specific, current deadline for things to improve, implying a decision will be made after this time.
    *   ""Eventually it'll get sick enough..."" - Indicates a future point where the ""put down"" action would occur.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific method (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons) is mentioned.
    *   No specific location is mentioned.
    *   No preparations (notes, acquiring means) are described.
    *   No research or seeking information about methods is mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No past suicide attempts are mentioned.
    *   No interrupted attempts are mentioned.
    *   No self-harm behaviors are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes, through the ""put down"" metaphor applied to self.
    *   Plan/method/preparation? No.
    *   Past suicide attempt? No.

    Based on the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The ""put down"" metaphor is explicit enough, especially with the clarification ""put itself down,"" to be considered an explicit expression of wanting to end life.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit death wishes (via metaphor) moves it from INDICATOR to IDEATION. The absence of a plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR. The absence of a completed past action keeps it from being ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method.

Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide seriously,"" ""suicide pact,"" and ""demise."" It also refers to ""it"" in the context of suicide. This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The plotting has been ""on and off for months."" The drafting of the will happened ""Yesterday."" The current feeling is ""Today, I feel better"" and ""I am out of my hole for now."" While the immediate urgency for *acting* is low, the *existence* of past preparations and ongoing plotting is significant.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""plotting my suicide seriously"" indicates planning.
    *   ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" is a concrete preparation. Drafting a will is a strong indicator of specific preparation for death, often associated with suicide plans.
    *   ""I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so."" This shows detailed thought about the *method* of discovery and aftermath, which is part of planning.
    *   ""I would never use a weapon from my household."" This is a negative specification of a method, but it still demonstrates consideration of specific methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes ""plotting"" and ""drafting my will."" These are preparations and planning, but not past *attempts* (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). There's no description of a completed action with intent to die.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide content is present (Step 1), so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts AND specific plans/preparations (plotting, drafting will, considerations about methods/aftermath) (Step 3). This moves it beyond IDEATION.
    *   There is no description of a past *completed* suicide attempt (Step 4). The drafting of a will is a preparation, not an attempt.

    Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with specific preparations (""drafted my will"") and detailed planning (""plotting,"" considerations about methods/aftermath) fits the definition of **BEHAVIOR**. Even though the person states they feel better ""for now"" and ""don't think I would do 'it',"" the *description* of past and ongoing planning and preparation is the key factor. The rule ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR"" applies directly.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post expresses extreme distress, anxiety, feeling abused, and a desire for current negative experiences to stop (""i want it to stop"").
    *   It contains the phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me."" While this indicates a feeling of being a burden or worthlessness, it is *not* an explicit statement of wanting to die or end one's own life. It's about how *others* would be better off.
    *   There is no explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""killing self,"" ""ending life,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""being dead,"" ""not wanting to be alive,"" ""going to die,"" ""want to be gone,"" or ""don't want to survive"" (in the context of life itself). ""I want it to stop"" refers to the abuse/criticism, not life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""today"" refers to the incident with Z.
    *   ""endless myopic bouts"" indicates ongoing distress.
    *   No urgency related to suicidal action.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post expresses severe distress and feelings of being a burden, but it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die*.
    *   According to the definition, if NO explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned, it falls under INDICATOR. The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is an indirect indicator of distress and potential suicidal ideation, but it does not meet the ""explicit expression of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life"" criteria for IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is implicit, not explicit. ""I want it to stop"" refers to the situation, not life.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: The rule states to choose IDEATION if *ANY explicit* death/suicide mention. Since there is *no explicit* mention, it remains INDICATOR.

Therefore, the post fits the definition of INDICATOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post expresses extreme anger, frustration, exhaustion (""i'm so tired,"" ""no more energy to deal with this anymore""), and despair (""the world is just fucked in every single way. EVERYTHING IS FUCKED"").
    *   It questions existence (""why the fuck would you bring someone into this world when you know how fucked it is JUST TO ABANDON THEM ON TOP OF THAT?"").
    *   The phrase ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"" is directed at another person and implies a wish for that person's absence or death to bring peace to the poster and others. However, the critical rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned."" Therefore, this phrase does not count as explicit suicidal content *for the poster*.
    *   There is no explicit mention of the *poster* wanting to die, kill themselves, end their life, or not wanting to be alive. Phrases like ""want to be gone"" or ""don't want to survive"" are not present regarding the poster's own life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   The post describes current feelings (""i'm so tired,"" ""i have no more energy"").
    *   No immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""going to.""

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Based on the analysis, there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned *by the poster for themselves*. The post clearly expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and general dissatisfaction with life. According to the decision logic, if no explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned, it falls into the INDICATOR category.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The post does not contain explicit self-directed death wishes. The distress is high, but the specific language required for IDEATION (e.g., ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I wish I was dead"") is absent.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: There is no ""ANY explicit death/suicide mention"" *for the poster*. Therefore, INDICATOR is the correct choice.

The post conveys profound emotional pain and a sense of being overwhelmed, but it does not contain explicit statements of suicidal intent for the person writing it.

I barely leave the house anymore. All I want is to have a job so I can be a normal, functioning member of society. I just want to have a sense of purpose. I want to meet new people and go places. I'm so sick of sitting inside all day, waiting for the next day in hopes it will somehow be the day where everything changes. I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life. And at this rate, I really feel like nothing is going to change. It's been so stagnant for so long.

I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself, but."" This is a direct mention of ""kill myself."" Although it's framed as a negation, the very act of stating it, followed by a detailed description of profound distress and hopelessness (""nothing going for me,"" ""sick of this life,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""walls are closing in and there's no escape""), indicates that suicide is a concept present in their thoughts. According to Critical Classification Rule #2 (""Even if someone says 'my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to,' this is still IDEATION because suicide is explicitly mentioned""), this counts.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current, ongoing feelings of stagnation and hopelessness. There are no immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" regarding suicide.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research related to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method? Yes. The phrase ""I don't want to kill myself, but..."" explicitly references suicide, and there is no plan or method.
    *   Therefore, based on the presence of explicit suicide content and the absence of a plan/method, the classification leans towards IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I don't want to kill myself"" is explicit. The ""but"" clause describes severe distress, confirming the context of the thought.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** This aligns perfectly with Rule #2: ""Even if someone says 'my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to,' this is still IDEATION because suicide is explicitly mentioned."" The user explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" despite stating they don't want to.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention. ""Kill myself"" is explicit.

**Final Decision:** The post contains an explicit mention of suicide (""kill myself"") coupled with significant distress and hopelessness, but it lacks any specific plan, method, or history of attempts. This fits the definition of IDEATION.

I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" and ""I want to kill myself."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tomorrow"" indicates a specific, immediate future timing. ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself"" indicate current urgency.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family"" - This specifies a particular time and circumstance for the intended act, which constitutes a specific *plan* regarding timing and opportunity.
    *   ""I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" - This strongly suggests a *preparation* (contacting people, likely for farewells) before an intended act. While ""go out"" is vague, in the context of wanting to die, it implies ending life. This is a preparatory action.
    *   No specific *method* (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, but the presence of a specific *time/circumstance plan* and *preparatory actions* is sufficient for BEHAVIOR.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts are mentioned. The focus is on current thoughts and future intent/preparations.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts AND specific plans (timing, circumstance) and preparations (contacting people before the act). This moves it beyond simple IDEATION.
    *   It does not describe a *completed past attempt*, so it's not ATTEMPT.
    *   The combination of explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific timeframe (""tomorrow""), and preparatory actions (""hit up everyone... and try and go out"") aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself"" are explicit.
*   The post describes a specific future plan and preparatory actions, not just intrusive thoughts.
*   No interrupted actions are described.
*   Focus is on present desire and future plan/preparation.
*   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: The specific timing (""tomorrow"") and the preparatory action (""hit up everyone... and try and go out"") are key indicators for BEHAVIOR, as they represent a plan and preparations.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" is a strong indicator of a desire to end one's life or engage in severe self-harm with suicidal intent. While ""yeet"" is slang, in this context of profound despair and feeling ""dead inside,"" it explicitly conveys a wish to remove oneself from existence. ""I'm still dead inside"" is metaphorical but contributes to the overall tone of despair. The key phrase is ""yeet myself way too much,"" which implies a desire for self-destruction/ending life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I just want to... yeet myself"" indicates a current desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations, or research is mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted attempts are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end their life (""yeet myself"" in this context) but without specific plans, methods, or preparations. This aligns with the definition of IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""yeet myself"" is interpreted as an explicit expression of a death wish or desire to end life, given the context of deep sadness and feeling ""beyond saving.""
*   **Between INDICATOR/IDEATION:** The explicit desire to ""yeet myself"" pushes it past INDICATOR into IDEATION.
*   **Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR:** No specific plan or method is mentioned, so it does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.
*   **Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT:** No past completed action is described.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I tried to end it once before."" and ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded."" This clearly identifies suicide content and a past action with suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I tried to end it once before"" indicates a past event. ""Sometimes I wish I succeeded"" indicates an ongoing sentiment related to that past event. The rest of the post describes current distress and potential future negative consequences (""If i lose my job because of it I might have to move back home"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of a current plan, method, or preparation for suicide in the post. The ""end it"" refers to a past action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""I tried to end it once before"" is a direct statement of a past suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit mention of a past suicide attempt (""I tried to end it once before"").
    *   According to the `ATTEMPT` category definition: ""Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome. Must involve a concrete action that occurred in the past... If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""
    *   Even though there's no *current* plan, the presence of a *past attempt* is the defining factor for this classification. The distress and the wish to have succeeded in the past attempt further reinforce the severity but the core classification driver is the past attempt itself.
    *   The critical rule ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions"" directly applies here.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I just wanna kill myself"") but does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I just wanna kill myself"" is an explicit expression of a death wish.
*   No plan or method is mentioned, so it does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, so it does not escalate to ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrases ""my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" in the context of ""torture cycle"" and feeling ""defeated"" are explicit expressions of wanting to end life/the struggle, aligning with ""ending life"" or ""not wanting to be alive."" The critical rule states ""Phrases like 'I'm going to die soon' or 'I want to be gone' ARE explicit expressions of death wishes when in context of distress."" ""Get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" fit this.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Now my brain is screaming"" indicates current urgency. ""Every time I am back here"" indicates an ongoing, cyclical nature.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide."" This clearly indicates explicit suicidal thoughts and intent.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" refer to a past decision point and proximity to action. The current situation is a consequence of averting that action.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""attempting suicide"" but does not specify any particular method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) or specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). It only states the *intent* was high and they were *close* to acting.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes being ""so close to attempting suicide"" but explicitly states that the action was *not* taken; instead, the person ""dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am."" This indicates an averted action, not a completed past attempt, nor an initiated and interrupted attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   The person describes being ""so close to attempting suicide,"" which is a strong expression of suicidal intent.
    *   However, there are *no specific plans, methods, or preparations* mentioned. The post does not describe an *initiated* action that was then interrupted. It describes a situation where suicide was a very strong consideration and nearly acted upon, but ultimately averted by seeking help.
    *   According to the rules, BEHAVIOR requires ""specific plans, methods, preparations, or research"" or ""interrupted attempts where action was initiated."" None of these are present. The phrase ""so close to attempting suicide"" indicates severe ideation, where the person was at the brink of acting, but without the concrete details of *how* or an *initiated action*.
    *   Therefore, it fits the IDEATION category: ""explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" The proximity to the action makes it severe ideation.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit suicide content is present.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The post doesn't describe an action that was initiated and then stopped (e.g., ""I put the pills in my mouth but spit them out""). It describes being ""so close"" to attempting, implying the decision was made *not* to proceed with the attempt.
*   **When in Doubt (IDEATION/BEHAVIOR):** Choose IDEATION because no specific method/plan is mentioned.

The post describes a very high level of suicidal intent and proximity to action, but it lacks the *specifics* (method, plan, initiated action) required to classify it as BEHAVIOR. It is severe ideation.

161,I cant take it. I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity. Its excruciating,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself."" The rule states: ""Even if the person says they don't want to act on thoughts, explicit mention of suicide/death still counts."" In this case, the user states ""I wont kill myself of course,"" which is a denial of intent, but the phrase ""kill myself"" is present. Therefore, suicide content is identified.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post expresses current distress (""I cant take it,"" ""pain makes me want to scream""). No specific timing for suicidal action is present, as suicidal action is explicitly denied.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The user denies suicidal intent.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm behaviors are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post *does* contain an explicit mention of ""kill myself,"" even if negated. According to the ""SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION"" note and ""Critical Classification Rule 2 (Intrusive Thoughts)"" (which implies that the *presence* of the word/thought is key, even if resisted/denied), this means it cannot be INDICATOR.
    *   The post does not contain a plan, method, or preparation, so it is not BEHAVIOR.
    *   The post does not describe a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, by elimination and strict adherence to the rule that ""explicit mention of suicide/death still counts"" even when denied, the classification falls into IDEATION. The ""When in Doubt"" rule also supports this: ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention.""

162,I wish I could stop obsessing over appearance. All the females around me want to become prettier which has only intensified my gender dysphoria. I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing. I want to be a male now.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses distress related to gender dysphoria and appearance (""I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing"", ""I want to be a male now""). However, there is absolutely no mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, ""going to die"", ""want to be gone"", ""don't want to survive"", or ""want it to be over.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** There are no urgency or timing indicators related to suicidal intent. The post describes current feelings of distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No plan or method for suicide is mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm behaviors are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, the classification should be INDICATOR. The post expresses distress and dissatisfaction with life circumstances (gender dysphoria) but does not cross the threshold into explicit suicidal ideation.

Much love,. Saturn",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I wish I had the courage to end it all."" This is a direct expression of wanting to end life. ""how much I loathe my existence"" and ""how much I absolutely hate myself"" indicate distress but the ""end it all"" phrase is the key for suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I wish I had the courage to end it all"" indicates a current desire or thought, but it's framed as a wish for courage, not an immediate intent or plan. The post also contains elements of enduring (""I just want the courage to endure it all,"" ""here I stay. waiting,"" ""Stay around to see these days"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted attempts are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""I wish I had the courage to end it all"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation: No.
    *   Past suicide attempt (completed action): No.
    Based on the framework, explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method leads to IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I wish I had the courage to end it all"" is explicit.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""end it all"" moves it past INDICATOR. The absence of a plan/method keeps it from BEHAVIOR. The absence of a past completed action keeps it from ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts but no plan or method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now,"" ""i almost committed suicide,"" and ""yet i still consider [suicide]."" This clearly identifies suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""right now"" indicates current state. ""a few days ago"" refers to a past near-action. ""yet i still consider"" indicates ongoing thoughts.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""i didn't have anything to do it with,"" which means there was no specific plan or method available *at that specific time*. However, the phrase ""yet i still consider"" implies ongoing suicidal ideation. There is no *current* specific plan or method described.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" is critical. This describes an *interrupted attempt* or a near-attempt where the intent to act was present, but the means were not. According to the rules, ""Interrupted actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" The ""almost committed suicide"" indicates an action that was initiated or very nearly initiated, even if prevented by external factors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present: Yes.
    *   Plan/method/preparation: While no *current* plan is stated, the description of ""almost committed suicide"" due to lack of means falls under ""Interrupted attempts where action was initiated"" which is part of the BEHAVIOR definition. This is more than just thoughts; it describes being on the verge of acting.
    *   It is not ATTEMPT because the action was not completed (""almost committed suicide but I didn't have anything to do it with"").
    *   It is stronger than IDEATION because it describes past proximity to action, not just thoughts.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": Explicit mentions are present.
*   ""Interrupted Actions"": The phrase ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" directly fits the definition of an interrupted action, which is classified as BEHAVIOR.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": The past near-action (""almost committed suicide"") combined with ongoing consideration (""yet i still consider"") elevates the risk.
*   ""When in Doubt"": The presence of the ""almost committed suicide"" event pushes it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR, as it signifies a step beyond mere thoughts towards action, even if interrupted.

Therefore, the classification should be BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times (""suicide with me"", ""can anyone suicide with me together"", ""want to suicide too""). This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""suicide with me"" and ""can anyone suicide with me together"" indicate a current desire or invitation, not a past event or general ongoing feeling without immediate implication.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), specific locations (e.g., a bridge), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods. It's a general call for shared suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts (""I tried"", ""I overdosed"") or interrupted attempts. The post is about a current desire/invitation.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide wishes are mentioned, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but there is NO plan/method mentioned. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan/method/preparation, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.

Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of wanting to commit suicide but without specific plans or methods. This fits the definition of IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""suicide with me"" is explicit.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION because no method/plan is mentioned.

I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""I want to kms"", ""I really want to hang myself"", ""when I kill myself"", ""thinking about killing myself"", ""put the rope around my neck and 'practice' hung"", ""trying again"" (referring to suicide), and ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"". All are clear mentions of suicide or death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""right now"", ""can't stop thinking"", ""I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again"", ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"" indicate strong current and immediate urgency. The ""practice hung"" is a very recent past action.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific method: ""hang myself"" and ""rope"". It also describes an action taken related to the method: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"". This clearly indicates a specific plan and an initiated action.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes an action: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped"". This is an interrupted action, not a completed attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific plan/method (""hang myself"", ""rope"") and an initiated action (""put the rope around my neck and 'practice' hung"") are present.
    *   The action was ""stopped,"" meaning it was an interrupted action, not a completed one.

    Based on the ""Critical Classification Rules"":
    *   ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" This rule directly applies to ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped"".
    *   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned. A method (hanging) and an initiated action are mentioned.
    *   Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions. This was explicitly stopped, so it's not an ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the post fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""violently suicidal,"" ""I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead,"" ""my suicidal ideation,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** There are strong immediate urgency indicators: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""It's finally fucking time."" The person is expressing current intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states, ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" This is a specific method (""gun"") that has been considered, even if the exact execution is still uncertain. This qualifies as mentioning a specific method/plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions past ""suicidal ideation"" and a past conversation about being suicidal, but it does not describe any past *completed* suicide attempts or *interrupted* attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific method (""gun"") is mentioned as a strong consideration/thought, even if not yet acquired or fully planned. This moves it beyond simple ideation.
    *   No past completed attempts are described.

    Therefore, the classification is **BEHAVIOR** because there are explicit suicidal thoughts AND a specific method is mentioned as a consideration.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""full intentions to end things,"" which is a clear expression of wanting to die/commit suicide. It also mentions ""doesn't want me dead"" and ""I'm at the edge,"" reinforcing the suicidal theme.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I just finished driving up to the mountains"" indicates a very recent, past action taken with immediate intent. ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" indicates a current decision *not* to act, but the preceding action was driven by immediate suicidal intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" identifies a specific location (mountains) where the act was intended to occur. This implies a method related to the location (e.g., jumping). This constitutes a specific location/preparation for a suicidal act.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" describes an action (driving to the location with intent) that was initiated but then stopped (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). This fits the definition of an interrupted action or preparation.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""full intentions to end things"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes, driving to a specific location (mountains) with intent to end things is a preparation and implies a method tied to the location.
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action): No, the action was not completed (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). It was an initiated action that was interrupted.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""full intentions to end things"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The description of driving to the mountains with intent to end things, but then stopping, perfectly aligns with the rule: ""If someone describes... actions that were started but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT.""
*   **Past vs. Present:** While the driving happened recently, the *intent* was current at that time, and the *interruption* is current. The core of the post describes an initiated action towards suicide.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly moves beyond IDEATION because a specific action (driving to a location) was taken with suicidal intent. It is not an ATTEMPT because the action was not completed. Therefore, BEHAVIOR is the correct category.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want,"" which are clear expressions of wanting to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm ready to die,"" ""The date was set a while ago,"" ""I'm ready,"" ""Preps being made,"" and ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" all indicate current readiness and a planned, imminent action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""The date was set a while ago"" indicates a specific timeframe for the plan. ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"" explicitly states preparations are underway. ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" signifies a state of readiness to execute the plan. While a specific method isn't named, the *preparations* and *readiness* for a chosen method are clearly indicated.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts. The focus is on current preparations for a future action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I'm ready to die"") AND clear indicators of a plan/preparations (""The date was set,"" ""Preps being made,"" ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"").

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""Im thinking of ending my life."" This is a direct mention of wanting to die/commit suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Im thinking of ending my life"" indicates a current thought. The rest of the post provides context for this current feeling.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post *does not* mention any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods. It only states the thought.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post *does not* describe any past completed suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""Im thinking of ending my life"").
    *   No plan or method is mentioned.
    *   This fits the definition of IDEATION: ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Im thinking of ending my life"" is an explicit expression of death wishes.
*   No specific method or plan is detailed.
*   No past attempt is described.
*   Therefore, it falls squarely into IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" strongly implies an intent to end life or communication permanently. ""pls let me never wake up"" is a clear, explicit wish for death/not to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""its working!"" indicates an immediate, ongoing action. ""last post"" and ""never wake up"" refer to the immediate future.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The statement ""its working!"" implies that a method or plan is actively being carried out or has been initiated. While the specific method isn't named, the phrase indicates a concrete action is in progress that is intended to lead to death (""never wake up""). This goes beyond mere ideation.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts are explicitly mentioned. The focus is on a current, ongoing action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** There are explicit suicide thoughts (""last post"", ""never wake up""). Crucially, there is an indication of a plan/method being executed or initiated (""its working!""). This moves it beyond IDEATION. It is not a completed past action, so it's not ATTEMPT. This fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""pls let me never wake up"" is explicit. ""its working!"" implies an active process towards death.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** ""its working!"" suggests an action has been initiated.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post is about the present action and immediate future.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of ""its working!"" clearly indicates more than just a thought (IDEATION); it points to an active step or preparation (BEHAVIOR). It's not a completed past action (ATTEMPT).

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""im gonna do it,"" ""tonight im gonna do it,"" and ""im so ready to die."" These are clear expressions of suicidal intent and death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""tonight im gonna do it"" indicates immediate and current urgency.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user mentions ""i have 42 unnamed pills"" and ""i also have some allergy medicine."" They also describe the pills as ""very small so its easy to swallow,"" indicating a specific method (overdose via pills) and preparation (having the means readily available and noting their ease of use).

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post states, ""i feel like im always posting here, saying im gonna do it but then i never do."" This explicitly clarifies that despite past statements of intent, no *completed actions* were taken. Therefore, there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   Specific plan/method/preparation (pills, having them, noting ease of swallowing) is present.
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is described; in fact, the post explicitly states past intent was *not* acted upon.
    *   According to the rules, ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" This fits perfectly. It is not ATTEMPT because no completed past action is described. It is not IDEATION because a specific method is mentioned.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""im so ready to die"" and ""tonight im gonna do it"" are explicit.
*   ""Interrupted Actions"": Not applicable here, as no action was initiated and then stopped. The past statements were just statements, not actions.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": The focus is on the current intent (""tonight im gonna do it"") with present means (""i have 42 unnamed pills""). The past mention explicitly states no action was taken.
*   ""When in Doubt"": This clearly fits BEHAVIOR as it has explicit thoughts and a specific method/means. It doesn't qualify for ATTEMPT because no completed past action is described.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""More and more often it feels like the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself."" This is a direct mention of suicide. Phrases like ""I want to be done"" and ""I just want to be done with everything"" are initially ambiguous but are clarified by the explicit mention of ""kill myself.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""More and more often it feels like..."" indicates an ongoing, increasing consideration of suicide as a solution. It's a current thought process, not a past event or a fleeting thought.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself"") but does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The phrasing ""it feels like the only way... would be to just be done and kill myself"" indicates a personal consideration, not merely an intrusive thought being resisted.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The thoughts are presented as current and ongoing considerations.
*   **When in Doubt:** There is explicit suicide mention, ruling out INDICATOR. There is no plan/method, ruling out BEHAVIOR. There is no past completed action, ruling out ATTEMPT. Therefore, IDEATION is the correct classification.

174,I'm truly running on nothing but shear spite at this point. I really want to check out. I can not really express how much I want to check out at this point. The only thing that seems to be holding me here at this point is shear spite. It is not that I have any moral problem with suicide at this point or even care about what me unexpectedly checking out would do to the other in my life but it just seems like such a waste to go out this way when I have held on for so long but I have come to realize recently that even spite has its limits.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I really want to check out,"" which is an explicit expression of wanting to die/end life. It also directly mentions ""suicide"" (""moral problem with suicide"") and ""unexpectedly checking out"" and ""to go out this way."" This confirms explicit suicide/death wishes are present.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""at this point"" and ""I have come to realize recently"" indicate a current and ongoing state of desire to ""check out.""

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts (""I tried,"" ""I overdosed"") or interrupted attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""check out,"" ""suicide""). Therefore, it is not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but there is NO plan/method mentioned. This aligns perfectly with the definition of IDEATION.
    *   Since no plan/method is mentioned, it is not BEHAVIOR.
    *   Since no past completed action/attempt is described, it is not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I want to check out"" is treated as an explicit expression of death wishes.
*   There are explicit suicide thoughts (""moral problem with suicide,"" ""want to check out"") but no plan/method.
*   No interrupted actions or past completed attempts are described.
*   Focus is on current desires.
*   Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION due to explicit death/suicide mention.
*   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose IDEATION due to lack of plan/method.
*   Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Not applicable as it's not BEHAVIOR.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""im going to do it"" in the context of ""i cant do this anymore"" and ""im done"" strongly indicates an explicit intent to end life. The farewell tone (""thank you to the people I met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for"") further supports this interpretation.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""im going to do it"" indicates immediate or current intent. ""i cant do this anymore"" and ""im done"" also point to a current state of distress and resolution.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). It states intent but no how.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""im going to do it"") but no specific plan or method. According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""im going to do it"" is an explicit expression of intent to end life.
*   ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR"": Choose IDEATION because no method/plan is mentioned, despite the explicit suicidal thoughts.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" and expresses a desire for it to be ""easier"" and ""why not"" in the context of ending life. This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The question ""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"" indicates a current and immediate search for methods. The phrase ""right now"" also points to current distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user is asking for a ""way to kill myself,"" which falls under ""Research/seeking: asking about methods, looking for ways."" This indicates a search for a specific method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm actions. The focus is on current intent and seeking information.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"").
    *   A plan/method component is present: the user is ""seeking information about suicide methods"" by asking ""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"". This directly matches a criterion for BEHAVIOR.
    *   No past completed action is described, so it's not ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains extensive explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""dying,"" ""ending life,"" and detailed descriptions of the physical process of overdose. It is clearly *about* suicide and methods.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post is a general warning, framed as advice (""Don't take the pills""). It does not contain urgency or timing indicators related to the *author's own* suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes ""pills"" and ""overdosing"" as a method in great detail. However, this is presented as a general warning about the method's negative consequences, not as a plan or preparation *by the author* for themselves.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm behaviors *by the author*. The post describes general outcomes of overdose.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The critical rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned.""
    *   The author of this post is *warning others* about the dangers and unpleasantness of suicide by overdose. They are not expressing their own suicidal thoughts, plans, or history.
    *   Therefore, the author themselves is *not* exhibiting suicide risk based on this post.
    *   The post is informative and deterrent in nature, not an expression of personal distress or suicidal intent from the author.
    *   Since the author is not expressing personal ideation, behavior, or past attempts, those categories do not apply to the author.
    *   The 'INDICATOR' category is defined as ""Posts expressing distress, hopelessness, or general dissatisfaction with life WITHOUT any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die."" The author is *not* expressing distress, hopelessness, or dissatisfaction *about their own life*.
    *   However, I am strictly required to choose one of the four categories. Given that the author is not presenting personal risk, and the higher categories (IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, ATTEMPT) clearly do not apply to the author's *personal* state, 'INDICATOR' is the only remaining option by elimination, serving as the ""lowest risk"" or ""no discernible personal risk"" classification in this forced-choice scenario, even if its definition isn't a perfect fit for a purely informational post. The post is *related* to suicide, but the author is not expressing personal risk.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""im positive im gonna do it"" and ""i truly have no motivation to keep on living"". These are direct expressions of wanting to end life/die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post states ""in the future"" and ""ill do it when im fed up of this"", indicating future and conditional intent, not immediate urgency. It also says ""im good rn"" and ""not ready"".
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""no motivation to keep on living"", ""gonna do it""). However, there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. This fits the definition of IDEATION. The ""im good rn"" and ""not ready"" don't negate the explicit future intent.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""no motivation to keep on living"" and ""positive im gonna do it"" are explicit death wishes.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** Focus is on future intent, not past action.
*   **When in Doubt:** Explicit mention of wanting to end life means it's not INDICATOR. Lack of plan/method means it's not BEHAVIOR. No past completed action means it's not ATTEMPT. Therefore, IDEATION is the correct classification.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses severe distress, psychological torture, and a negative view of their existence (""living a life psychologically tortured,"" ""hate my parents for having me""). However, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, or phrases like ""want to be gone"" or ""don't want to survive."" The focus is on the pain of living, not the desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** No indicators related to immediate or past suicidal intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No mention of any plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of past attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, the classification falls under INDICATOR. The post describes distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life without explicitly stating a desire to end it.

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post describes a terrifying dream about others committing violence and the poster's subsequent panic and anxiety. There is absolutely no mention of the poster wanting to die, kill themselves, end their life, or any similar suicidal ideation. The fear is externalized (fear of the dream's content and its impact on sleep), not self-directed.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes a past event (the dream) and current feelings of anxiety about sleeping. There are no urgency indicators related to self-harm or suicide.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any plan or method for suicide. The violence described is inflicted by others in the dream, not by the poster on themselves.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, the post falls into the 'INDICATOR' category. It expresses distress (panic attack, anxiety about sleeping) but lacks any suicidal content.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" This is a direct reference to a past suicide attempt. The phrases ""end this suffering"" and ""so i can do it"" also indicate a desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" indicates a current desire to act. ""ive overdosed twice"" refers to past events.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No *current* specific plan or method is detailed for *future* action, but the past action involved ""overdosed,"" which is a specific method. The current desire to ""do it"" is contingent on finding a reason.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" This is a clear and explicit description of a past completed suicide attempt. The ""on purpose"" part confirms intent.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The presence of a clearly described past suicide attempt (""overdosed... on purpose"") immediately points to the ATTEMPT category. The critical rule states: ""If describes past suicide attempt (completed action) → ATTEMPT."" Also, ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" Even though there's a current desire, the past completed action is the strongest and most definitive element.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
*   The post describes a *completed past action* with intent to die (""overdosed... on purpose"").
*   This directly matches the definition of ATTEMPT.
*   The rule ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions"" is key here.

I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""all of a sudden I'm suicidal again."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""all of a sudden I'm suicidal again"" indicates a current state. ""I've run out of meds"" and ""asked for an urgent refill a few days ago"" describe a current situation contributing to the distress, implying immediacy of the suicidal thoughts.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted attempts are described. The phrase ""I'm suicidal again"" suggests a history of such thoughts, but not a past *attempt* as defined by a concrete action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are mentioned (""I'm suicidal again"").
    *   No plan or method is mentioned.
    *   No past completed attempt is described.
    *   Therefore, according to the framework, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I'm suicidal again"" is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.
*   No specific plan or method is detailed, ruling out BEHAVIOR.
*   No completed past action is described, ruling out ATTEMPT.
*   The explicit mention of ""suicidal"" rules out INDICATOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""now I want to die more than ever."" It also contains phrases like ""I can't have this life it's too painful,"" which reinforces a desire not to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""now I want to die more than ever"" indicates a current and immediate feeling.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""Everytime I try I fail"" is vague. It does not describe a concrete past suicide attempt (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). In the context, it seems to refer to attempts to cope or improve her life situation, rather than past suicide attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""now I want to die more than ever"").
    *   No specific plan or method is mentioned.
    *   No concrete past suicide attempt is described.
    *   According to the rules: If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""now I want to die more than ever"" is an explicit expression of a death wish.
*   No interrupted actions or concrete past attempts are described.
*   The lack of a plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR.
*   The lack of a concrete past action keeps it from being ATTEMPT.
*   The explicit death wish means it is not INDICATOR.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide by hanging"" and ""tied the noose,"" which are direct and explicit mentions of suicide and an associated action.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""ive alr tied the noose"" indicates a current or very recent action/preparation. ""still not sure"" indicates an immediate, ongoing state of contemplation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method (""hanging"") is mentioned, and a specific preparation (""tied the noose"") has been completed. The user is asking about the experience of this specific method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a current preparation (""tied the noose"") and contemplation, not a past completed suicide attempt. It's an action initiated in the present.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicide by hanging"").
    *   A specific plan/method is mentioned (""hanging"").
    *   A preparation/action has been taken (""tied the noose"").
    *   According to the rules, if there are explicit suicide thoughts AND a plan/method/preparation, it's BEHAVIOR. The rule ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck... - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT"" directly applies here, as tying the noose is an initiated action/preparation. It is not a completed past attempt.

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific method, and a concrete preparation, fitting the definition of BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly asks ""Should I kill myself?"" and states ""I want to die because of them."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide content and death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die"" indicate current contemplation and desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or seeking information about *how* to commit suicide. The question is about *whether* to, not *how*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Based on the presence of explicit suicide thoughts (""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"") and the absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation, the classification falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die"" are explicit.
*   When in Doubt: It's clearly IDEATION over INDICATOR due to explicit mention. It's IDEATION over BEHAVIOR because no plan/method is present. It's not ATTEMPT as no past action is described.

Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""on the brink of suicide"" but explicitly states it's an ""alternative for anyone on the brink of suicide,"" referring to others. The author states ""the road has saved me in the past"" from situations where they ""felt like I couldn't cope,"" implying distress, but not explicitly stating they had suicidal thoughts or wishes themselves. The phrase ""should I ever need it again"" refers to needing the coping mechanism, not needing to end their life. There is no explicit mention of the *author* wanting to die, kill themselves, or not wanting to be alive.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** No current urgency for the author. The past is about coping with distress, and the future is hypothetical (""should I ever need it again"") for the coping mechanism. The author states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment.""

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No plans or methods for suicide are mentioned by the author for themselves. The ""plan"" is going hobo as an *alternative* to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past suicide attempts are mentioned by the author. The actions described are going vagrant as a coping strategy.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post does *not* contain explicit suicide/death wishes from the author.
    *   The mention of ""suicide"" is in the context of offering an alternative to it for others, or as a problem that the author's coping mechanism helps avoid.
    *   The author describes past distress (""felt like I couldn't cope"") which falls under general distress, hopelessness, or general dissatisfaction with life.
    *   According to the rules, ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned."" The explicit mention of suicide is for ""anyone on the brink of suicide,"" not the author.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of INDICATOR: ""Posts expressing distress, hopelessness, or general dissatisfaction with life WITHOUT any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The author does not express ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I want to be gone.""
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not mentioned.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The author is currently functional and reflecting on past coping.
*   **When in Doubt:** The post does not have *any* explicit death/suicide mention *from the author's perspective* for themselves. It's about coping with distress.

Therefore, the classification is INDICATOR.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""end it"" but does *not* specify a method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) or a specific location tied to a method. Being ""drunk in my basement"" is a state and location, but not a *method* of suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end it"", ""can't go on anymore""). There is no specific plan, method, or preparation described.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""end it"" is an explicit expression of a death wish.
*   No specific method or plan is detailed, only the intent to ""end it"".
*   Therefore, it fits the definition of IDEATION (explicit expression of wanting to die/end life, but without specific plans/methods).

189,"I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen. Will I be able to successfully end my life? I'm fairly short, male and 56 kg.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""successfully end my life"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" indicates a current consideration or immediate intent to plan.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen."" explicitly states specific methods (pills) and their availability. The question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" is a form of seeking information about suicide methods and their efficacy.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm. The post is prospective.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end my life""). Specific methods (codeine, ibuprofen) are mentioned as being possessed, and the user is seeking information about their effectiveness for suicide. This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR (explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods/preparations/research).

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""end my life"" is explicit.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable.
*   Past vs. Present: The post is about a potential future action, not a past completed one.
*   When in Doubt: The presence of specific methods (""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"") and the act of ""seeking information about suicide methods"" (asking if it will be successful) clearly moves it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR. It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""why shouldi live"" - Implies questioning the value of life, leading to not wanting to live.
    *   ""resisting the desire to end"" - Explicitly mentions ""desire to end"" (life).
    *   ""everyday i ran out ofreasons tokeep myself alive"" - Explicitly states a lack of reasons to continue living.
    *   ""i cant do this anymore"" - General distress, but in context of the above, points to inability to continue living.
    *   ""i cant stand being here any other moment"" - Strong expression of not wanting to be alive right now.
    *   ""i cant imagine myslef living another year thisway"" - Expresses an inability to envision continuing to live.
    *   All these phrases, especially ""desire to end"" and ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" are explicit mentions of not wanting to be alive/suicide.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""everyday i ran out of reasons"" - Ongoing, current state.
    *   ""i cant do this anymore"" - Immediate feeling.
    *   ""i cant stand being here any other moment"" - Immediate feeling.
    *   ""i cant imagine myslef living another year thisway"" - Future-oriented, but reflects immediate distress.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons) are mentioned.
    *   No specific locations (bridges, buildings) are mentioned.
    *   No preparations (notes, acquiring means) are described.
    *   No research or seeking information about methods is indicated.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No past attempts (""I tried"", ""I overdosed"") are mentioned.
    *   No interrupted attempts are described.
    *   No self-harm behaviors are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die/not wanting to be alive (""resisting the desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""i cant stand being here any other moment,"" ""i cant imagine myslef living another year thisway"").
    *   There are NO specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned.
    *   According to the framework, if explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method, it's IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Phrases like ""resisting the desire to end"" and ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"" are explicit expressions of death wishes/not wanting to be alive.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly falls between INDICATOR (because it's more than just general distress) and BEHAVIOR (because there's no plan/method). It fits IDEATION perfectly.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide."" This directly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""will probably commit suicide eventually"" indicates a future possibility or ongoing thought, not an immediate crisis (""tonight"", ""now""). The question ""How do you tell..."" suggests contemplation rather than imminent action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), specific locations, preparations, or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""commit suicide"").
    *   NO plan or method is mentioned.
    *   Therefore, according to the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""commit suicide"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not directly applicable, but the explicit mention of suicide is key.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post discusses a future probability and the idea of communicating it, not a past action or a current, concrete plan.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of suicide rules out INDICATOR. The lack of a specific plan/method rules out BEHAVIOR. The lack of a past completed action rules out ATTEMPT. This aligns perfectly with IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself."" This is a clear mention of suicide/ending life. Even though the user expresses a desire to live (""I wanna see my daughters grow up""), the explicit mention of ""end myself"" means it counts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""keep telling me"" indicates ongoing thoughts. ""I'm losing grip"" and ""it's just getting worse"" indicate current distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned in the post.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""end myself""). However, there is NO mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""end myself"" is an explicit expression of death wishes.
*   The phrase ""my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to"" is analogous to ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"" even if the person expresses a desire not to act on it. This falls under the ""Intrusive Thoughts"" rule, classifying it as IDEATION.
*   No plan or method is specified, ruling out BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, ruling out ATTEMPT.
*   Since there is explicit mention of ending life, it cannot be INDICATOR.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" explicitly mentions ""die."" While framed as a hopeful thought, it directly addresses the concept of dying, implying that it was a consideration. This counts as explicit mention of death wishes/thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post discusses current feelings (""not okay right now"") and future hopes (""hope i can have that one day,"" ""maybe i don't need to die""). The reflection on ""not needing to die"" is a current thought process.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There IS explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned (""die""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There ARE explicit suicide thoughts (""die"") but NO plan/method. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There are no plans/methods, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There are no past completed actions, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""maybe i don't need to die"" is an explicit expression of the thought of dying, even if it's a hopeful negation of it. The thought itself was present.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR and IDEATION, choose IDEATION because ""die"" is explicitly mentioned. There are no methods/plans, so it's not BEHAVIOR. No past completed actions, so not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts are always there."" It also asks ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"", which is a direct question about dying from a specific method. The phrase ""i will do it anyway"" refers to taking the pills, implying intent related to the previous question about dying. ""i don't wanna die rn"" acknowledges death, even if currently negated, and the overall context is still about suicidal ideation and potential action.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""i don't wanna die rn"" indicates no immediate intent to die, but ""when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there"" indicates ongoing thoughts. The question ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" and the statement ""i will do it anyway"" suggest a current consideration and future intent regarding taking the pills, even if the stated immediate goal is calmness.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific method: ""taking 3 xanax pills."" It also seeks information about the lethality of this specific method (""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?""). The statement ""i will do it anyway"" indicates intent to carry out this specific action.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm actions.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""suicidal thoughts"", ""can you die from taking..."").
    *   Plan/method/preparation mentioned: Yes (""3 xanax pills"", asking about dying from them, intent to take them).
    *   Therefore, it falls under ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" It does not describe a past completed attempt.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" and the direct question about dying from pills are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** While ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" could be intrusive, the post goes beyond just thoughts by mentioning a specific method and intent to use it.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The focus is on current thoughts, a current question about a method, and future intent to take the pills.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of a specific method (Xanax pills) and the intent to take them (""i will do it anyway"") in the context of suicidal thoughts clearly moves it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR. It is not an ATTEMPT as no past completed action is described.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself."" This is a clear mention of wanting to die/kill oneself.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""i will wait until I can kill myself"" indicates a future intent, conditional on another event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post asks, ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"". This is seeking information for self-harm methods. However, the definition of BEHAVIOR specifically requires ""specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about *suicide* methods."" While self-harm can be related, this question is about self-harm, not explicitly a suicide method. The ""kill myself"" statement itself does not include a method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past suicide attempts are mentioned. The self-harm question is seeking information for future action, not describing past action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There is no specific plan, method, or preparation for *suicide* mentioned. The question about self-harm methods is not explicitly a *suicide* method according to the strict definition for BEHAVIOR.
    *   Therefore, it fits the IDEATION category: explicit expressions of wanting to die/commit suicide, but without specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" is explicit.
*   **Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR:** The post has explicit suicidal thoughts. To be BEHAVIOR, it needs a *specific plan/method for suicide* or *research about suicide methods*. The question about self-harm methods is not explicitly a *suicide* method. Thus, it remains IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Im probably going to kill myself soon"" and ""i just wish i wasn't even born to begin with."" This clearly identifies suicide content and a wish not to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""soon"" indicates a near-future intention. ""lately"" indicates ongoing strong urges. ""Im probably going to"" indicates current likelihood/intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted attempts are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""Im probably going to kill myself soon""). However, there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Im probably going to kill myself soon"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** Focus is on current urges and future intent.
*   **When in Doubt:** It's clearly IDEATION because there's explicit suicide mention but no method/plan, ruling out BEHAVIOR. It's not ATTEMPT as no past action is described.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""plummet to the ground"" and wanting to be a ""corpse,"" indicating a clear desire for death by suicide. Phrases like ""so tempted"" reinforce this.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""so tempted to just go"" indicates a current, active thought process or temptation. It's not a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes a specific method (""plummet to the ground"") and a specific location (""the highest floor""). This constitutes a clear plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or completed actions. It describes a current temptation/plan.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""corpse,"" ""plummet""). A specific plan/method is also present (""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground""). According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""plummet to the ground"" and ""corpse"" are explicit death wishes.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** No action was initiated, only a strong temptation/plan.
*   **Past vs. Present:** This is a present temptation/plan, not a past completed action.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly goes beyond IDEATION due to the specific method/location. It is not an ATTEMPT as no past action was completed. Therefore, BEHAVIOR is the correct category.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he won't feel that bad if I kill myself"" is a conditional thought process. It doesn't indicate immediate urgency like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but it expresses a thought related to suicide.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does NOT mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods. It only states ""kill myself"" generally.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: YES (""kill myself"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation mentioned: NO.
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action): NO.
    *   Therefore, according to the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""kill myself"" is an explicit expression.
*   No specific plan or method is mentioned, so it does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.

This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""jump"", ""want to die"", and ""gain the courage"" to jump. It also references someone else who ""took their life the same way"". This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current and ongoing actions: ""when I'm standing on the ledge"", ""I'll stand there. Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve."" This indicates present and repeated engagement with suicidal ideation and actions.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method (""jump"") and a specific location (""ledge of a hospital parking garage"") are clearly identified. The person is actively engaging with this plan by being at the location and ""Trying to work up the nerve.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes repeated actions of being on the ledge with the intent to jump, but not completing the act (""I can never get the nerve to jump""). This fits the definition of an ""interrupted attempt"" or preparatory action as per Critical Classification Rule 3. The person is initiating the action (going to the ledge, standing there) with suicidal intent, even if the final act is not completed.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific plan/method (jumping from a specific ledge) is present.
    *   The person describes preparatory actions or interrupted attempts (being on the ledge, trying to gain courage to jump) rather than a completed past attempt.
    *   According to Critical Classification Rule 3, ""If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" The act of standing on the ledge with the intent to jump, but not completing it, falls under this rule.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide,"" ""die in combat,"" ""multiple attempts on my life,"" ""my death seems to ultimate answer,"" and ""searching about ways to kill myself."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when..."" (Past)
    *   ""I have multiple attempts on my life"" (Past, ongoing history)
    *   ""recently I began searching about ways to kill myself"" (Current/Recent)

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   For the *past attempt*: ""using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope"" - specific methods mentioned.
    *   For *current behavior*: ""recently I began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"" - This indicates actively seeking methods/plans.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states, ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger..."" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life."" This confirms past completed suicide attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide thoughts and wishes.
    *   It describes past *completed actions* of suicide attempts (""I tried committing suicide,"" ""multiple attempts on my life"").
    *   It also describes current *behavior* (searching for methods).
    *   According to the `Critical Classification Rules`, specifically the ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT"" rule: ""Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions. If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post uses phrases like ""more dead inside"" and ""Im done with everything."" ""More dead inside"" is a metaphorical expression of emotional pain and numbness, not a literal wish for death or suicide. ""Im done with everything"" expresses extreme frustration and a feeling of giving up on life's struggles, but it does not explicitly state a desire to end life or commit suicide. There is no mention of ""suicide,"" ""killing self,"" ""ending life,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""being dead,"" or ""not wanting to be alive"" in a literal sense.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current feelings (""Im done""). There are no indicators of immediate suicidal intent or timing related to a suicidal act.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, the classification should be INDICATOR. The distress is clear, but the explicit suicidal language is absent.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases used are implicit expressions of distress and hopelessness, not explicit death wishes. ""More dead inside"" is metaphorical.
*   **When in Doubt:** There is no explicit suicide/death mention, so it falls squarely into INDICATOR rather than IDEATION.

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"" in the context of ending distress/life. ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" reinforces the intent to act on these thoughts. This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I think I can jump off,"" ""I'm getting more courage,"" and ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicate a current thought process leading towards an imminent or soon-to-happen action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method (""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"") and a specific location (""bedroom window"") are clearly stated. The phrase ""getting more courage"" implies preparation or moving towards the act.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts. The post describes a current intention and future planned action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present. A specific plan/method (jumping from a bedroom window) is described. This aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR. It is not an ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described. It is not IDEATION because a specific method is mentioned.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window"" are explicit expressions of suicidal intent and method.
*   A specific method and location are provided, moving it beyond mere ideation.
*   No past completed action is described, so it's not ATTEMPT.

203,"Should I tell my mom about my issues. I know most peoples first reaction is ""yes, having help only makes it better"" but I feel like I don't really have that relationship with her. There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""writing suicide notes."" This is a direct and explicit reference to suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes."" This indicates a recurring or ongoing action that happens in the present/near-present, not a single past completed event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""writing suicide notes"" is a clear preparation for suicide, as specified in the BEHAVIOR category's definition (""Describing preparations (acquiring means, writing notes)"").
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""I'm writing suicide notes"" describes an action the person takes, which is a preparation. It is not a past completed attempt (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"").
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide content is present (""suicide notes""). So, not INDICATOR.
    *   There is explicit suicide content AND a preparation (""writing suicide notes""). This moves it beyond IDEATION.
    *   ""Writing suicide notes"" falls directly under the ""preparations"" aspect of the BEHAVIOR category.
    *   It does not describe a *completed* past suicide attempt. Therefore, it is not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""writing suicide notes"" is explicit.
*   ""Interrupted Actions"": Not applicable here, as it describes a preparation, not an interrupted attempt.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": ""I'm writing suicide notes"" suggests an ongoing or recurring present behavior/preparation.
*   ""When in Doubt"": The presence of ""writing suicide notes"" clearly places it in BEHAVIOR, as it's a specific preparation. It's not an ATTEMPT because no completed action is described.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""hope i die."" This is a clear expression of a death wish. The phrase ""fuck me fuck da world"" also indicates extreme distress and self-loathing, reinforcing the suicidal ideation.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""hope i die"" indicates a current desire or ongoing thought, but no immediate urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""hope i die"") but lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the decision logic, if explicit suicide thoughts are present but no plan/method, it's IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""hope i die"" is an explicit expression of a death wish, fitting the criteria for IDEATION over INDICATOR.
*   There are no plans or methods, so it does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.
*   There are no past completed actions, so it does not escalate to ATTEMPT.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post describes a past action: ""Just cut to deep"". While not explicitly stating ""suicide"" or ""want to die"", ""cut to deep"" is a clear description of severe self-harm, which is a form of suicidal behavior or a very high-risk action often associated with suicidal intent. This counts as explicit mention of a dangerous action related to self-harm/suicide.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Just cut"" indicates a very recent past event. It is a completed action.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The method is ""cut"". The severity is indicated by ""to deep"". This is a specific method and implies a significant injury.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a past, completed action (""cut to deep""). This is a concrete action that occurred.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   It's not INDICATOR because it describes a concrete action, not just general distress.
    *   It's not IDEATION because it describes a completed action with a method, not just a wish or thought.
    *   Now, distinguish between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT.
        *   BEHAVIOR typically involves explicit suicidal thoughts *and* plans/methods, or *interrupted* attempts. The post describes a *completed* action, not an interrupted one, and doesn't explicitly state ""suicidal thoughts"" (though it implies severe distress).
        *   ATTEMPT describes ""past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome. Must involve a concrete action that occurred in the past.""
    *   The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" is a concrete action that occurred in the past. While ""intent to die"" is not explicitly stated, the severity (""to deep"") strongly implies a high level of risk and potential intent, or at least an action that falls into the most severe category due to its nature as severe self-harm.
    *   The critical rule ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions"" is key here. ""Just cut to deep"" is a completed past action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post quotes phrases like ""don't do it!"" which are related to suicide prevention. However, the author is *criticizing* people who say this, not expressing their own suicidal thoughts directly. The author states ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice,"" indicating distress, but does not explicitly state what that feeling is in terms of wanting to die or commit suicide. There is no explicit mention by the author of wanting to die, kill self, end life, or not wanting to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** No urgency or timing related to the author's own suicidal actions.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No plan, method, location, or preparation mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm behaviors mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post expresses significant distress, anger, and dissatisfaction with how others respond to misery. While it references a context where suicide might be discussed (by quoting ""don't do it!""), the author *themselves* does not explicitly state a wish to die or commit suicide. It falls under ""Posts expressing distress, hopelessness, or general dissatisfaction with life WITHOUT any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases related to suicide are quoted as coming from *other people*, not expressed by the author themselves as their own intent. The author's own feelings are described as ""what I'm feeling"" which is not explicitly suicidal.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: There is no explicit death/suicide mention *by the author* about themselves. The distress is clear, but the suicidal intent is not explicitly stated.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i kinda just wanna die"". Even though it's followed by ""but dont at the same time"", the explicit wish to die is present.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""i kinda just wanna die"" indicates a general, ongoing feeling rather than an immediate plan or past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations, or research about suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""i kinda just wanna die"") but *without* any specific plans, methods, or preparations. This aligns directly with the definition of IDEATION. The conflicting feeling (""but dont at the same time"") does not negate the explicit mention of wanting to die, consistent with the ""Intrusive Thoughts"" rule.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now,"" ""want to justify dying,"" and ""thinking about partially planning to die."" This clearly identifies suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The thoughts are described as ""for a while now,"" ""increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months,"" and ""every single day I feel terrible."" This indicates ongoing and increasing intensity.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states, ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst."" Crucially, it also says, ""I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die."" The phrase ""partially planning to die"" indicates engagement in the process of planning, even if specific methods aren't detailed. This moves it beyond mere ideation.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""want to justify dying,"" ""planning to die""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   The post goes beyond just wanting to die by mentioning ""partially planning to die."" This indicates a step towards developing a plan, even if not fully formed or specific.
    *   According to the ""BEHAVIOR"" definition, it includes ""Posts with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans..."". While the plan isn't fully specific, the *act of planning* is mentioned (""partially planning"").
    *   The ""Critical Classification Rules"" state: ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" The mention of ""partially planning to die"" qualifies as a plan being mentioned.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""better off dead"", ""too scared to end it"", ""find a nice little spot to hang myself"", ""then i can rest in peace"".
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I've been thinking I could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as I can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself"" indicates a current, active contemplation of a suicide plan. ""now i really don't care any more"" also suggests a present state of reduced inhibition.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific plan and method are described: ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This includes a specific location (mountains/remote spot) and a specific method (hanging).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears."" This describes past suicidal ideation and reasons for *not* acting, not a past *completed* attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""better off dead"", ""end it"", ""hang myself""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   A specific plan/method is described (""drive out into the mountains and hike... find a nice little spot to hang myself""). This rules out IDEATION.
    *   The description is of a *plan* for a future action, not a *completed past action*. This rules out ATTEMPT.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language used (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore"") indicates a current and ongoing state of distress and desire for death.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations, or research related to suicide. The mention of therapy and antidepressants indicates coping efforts, not suicidal planning.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore""). However, there is NO mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, according to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post indicates ongoing, chronic suicidal thoughts (""its been years. Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts""). There are no immediate action indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" regarding a plan, but the *thoughts* are constant and current.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts"") but no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The mention of ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The phrase ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"" aligns with the concept of intrusive thoughts, and it still counts as IDEATION.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The focus is on current and ongoing suicidal thoughts, not past completed actions.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""new suicide method."" Even though the user states they try to suppress these thoughts and ""don't want to have to do that,"" the explicit mention of suicide and death wishes (in the context of a method) means it counts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method"" indicates a current development of a potential method. No immediate urgency like ""tonight"" but the thought process is active.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes a specific method: ""putting eye drops in his beverages"" and explicitly states this ""didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method."" This is a specific method being considered. The act of watching a video and deriving a method from it can be considered ""seeking information about suicide methods.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present. A specific method/plan is identified (""eye drops in his beverages"" as a ""new suicide method""). This moves it beyond mere ideation. No completed past action.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Clear explicit mention of suicide and a method.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The user expresses reluctance (""I don't want to have to do that"") but immediately follows with the development of a ""new suicide method."" According to the rule, even if they don't want to act, the explicit mention of suicide *and* a method pushes it to BEHAVIOR.
*   **Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR:** A specific method (""eye drops in his beverages"" as a ""new suicide method"") is clearly mentioned, which classifies it as BEHAVIOR.
*   **Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT:** No completed past action, so not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the post fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR due to explicit suicidal thoughts and the identification/consideration of a specific method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide note,"" ""nobody wonders why I stopped responding to calls or going to work"" (implying death), ""Planned everything out,"" ""free myself of my problems"" (contextually implying ending life), and ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" (explicit intent to commit suicide).

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post refers to past events (""A month ago I wrote a suicide note,"" ""Planned everything out,"" ""Then sabotaged myself"") but also expresses current feelings (""I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out"") and future intent (""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time""). The current contemplation of past plans for future action is key.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes significant planning: ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted,"" ""Planned everything out,"" ""Picked a time and place."" While a specific method like ""pills"" or ""jumping"" isn't named, the detail of the note, posting, time, and place constitutes a specific plan and preparation.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes an action that was initiated but not completed: ""Then sabotaged myself,"" ""blocked my own shot."" This falls under ""Interrupted attempts"" as per the Critical Classification Rules. The writing of the note and planning are also actions taken.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   Specific plans and preparations (note, time, place) are detailed.
    *   An interrupted action (""sabotaged myself,"" ""blocked my own shot"") is described.
    *   The post also expresses a current desire to re-engage with these plans (""coax the feeling back out,"" ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"").
    *   According to Critical Classification Rule 3, ""If someone describes... but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" The description of writing a note, planning, and then sabotaging fits this. The current contemplation of doing it ""this time"" reinforces the ""BEHAVIOR"" classification, as it points to current suicidal ideation with a history of detailed planning and interrupted action.

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts, detailed plans and preparations, and describes an interrupted action, along with current contemplation of acting on those plans. This aligns with the ""BEHAVIOR"" category.

I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains the phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"". This is an explicit expression of wanting to be gone/not exist, which falls under the category of ""not wanting to be alive"" or ""want to be gone"" as per the explicit vs. implicit rule.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post expresses current distress (""I am crying as I write this"", ""I am hanging on by threads at this moment"", ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present""). The ""if I were gone"" statement refers to a hypothetical current or future state of non-existence.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about suicide methods mentioned in the post.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There are no past attempts (e.g., ""I tried to"", ""I overdosed"") or interrupted attempts described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There ARE explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned (""if I were gone""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There ARE explicit suicide thoughts (""if I were gone"") but NO plan/method. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   There are NO explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation. So, it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There are NO descriptions of past completed suicide attempts. So, it's not ATTEMPT.

Based on the analysis, the presence of an explicit death wish (""if I were gone"") without any specific plan or method leads to the IDEATION classification. The critical rule ""Explicit vs. Implicit: Phrases like... 'I want to be gone' ARE explicit expressions of death wishes when in context of distress"" supports classifying ""if I were gone"" as an explicit death wish.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""make me want to die"" and ""I'm done with life,"" which are clear expressions of suicidal intent and not wanting to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""So Tuesday, I'm either going to..."" indicates a specific, immediate future timing for the planned actions.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post details specific methods: ""slit my wrist"" and ""hang myself from a tree."" It also mentions a specific location/context: ""from a tree for my parents to see"" and ""get into my broken car"" (potentially implying a car crash or using the car in the act).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past completed suicide attempts. The actions described are planned for the future (""Tuesday, I'm either going to..."").
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   Specific plans and methods are explicitly stated.
    *   This combination strongly points to the 'BEHAVIOR' category.
    *   It is not 'ATTEMPT' because no past completed action is described. It is a future plan.
    *   It is not 'IDEATION' because specific methods are mentioned.
    *   It is not 'INDICATOR' because suicide is explicitly mentioned with plans.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""want to die"" and ""done with life"" are explicit.
*   Specific methods are mentioned, moving it beyond IDEATION.
*   The actions are planned for the future, not past completed attempts, so it remains BEHAVIOR and not ATTEMPT.

217,"Having a lot of suicidal thoughts but I dont think im depressed. Throwaway because people I know, know my main acc. Turned 17 in Jan. Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts,"" ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please,"" and ""think that suicide would be better."" It also discusses ""suicide is selfish"" as the only thing stopping them. This clearly identifies explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The thoughts are current and ongoing (""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts,"" ""I often feel that it would be better if I was dead""). There are no immediate timing indicators for *action* (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), but the thoughts themselves are present and persistent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does NOT mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods. The discussion about death being like sleep is a philosophical view, not a method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does NOT describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The anecdote about being robbed with a knife describes a past event where they were calm, but this is not a suicide attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned.
    *   NO plan/method is mentioned.
    *   NO past suicide attempt is described.

    According to the framework: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

    Checking against categories:
    *   **INDICATOR:** Ruled out due to explicit mention of suicide/death wishes.
    *   **IDEATION:** Matches perfectly. Explicit suicidal thoughts and desire for death are present, but without any specific plan or method.
    *   **BEHAVIOR:** Ruled out as there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations.
    *   **ATTEMPT:** Ruled out as there is no description of a past completed suicide attempt.

    Critical Classification Rules check:
    *   ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" and ""it would be better if I was dead"" are explicit.
    *   The presence of suicidal thoughts, even with reasons *not* to act, still classifies as IDEATION.
    *   No interrupted actions or past attempts are described.
    *   The focus is on current thoughts.
    *   When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit mention. This is clear.
    *   When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION due to lack of method/plan. This is clear.

It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there."" This is a direct and explicit mention of being suicidal.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there"" refers to a current state of being, even if triggered by a past event. The user is currently seeking a hotline, indicating a present need due to this state.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly states regarding the *last time* they called, ""didn't have a method or anything."" For the *current* situation, there is no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, or preparations for suicide. The user's focus is on finding a non-intervening hotline.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a past intervention (""cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward"") but explicitly clarifies that during that time, they ""didn't have a method or anything."" This means the past event was an intervention due to perceived risk, not a completed suicide attempt by the user. There is no description of a past *attempt* (e.g., overdose, cutting with intent to die).
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes, ""more suicidal."" So, not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method: Yes, ""more suicidal"" indicates thoughts, and no plan/method is present in the current post. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation: No plan/method mentioned. So, not BEHAVIOR.
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action): No, describes a past intervention, not an attempt. The user explicitly states no method/attempt last time. So, not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""It made me 10x more suicidal"" is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.
*   No specific plan or method is mentioned for the current state.
*   The past event was an intervention, not a suicide attempt. The user explicitly stated ""didn't have a method or anything"" at that time.
*   Therefore, the classification falls under IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I dont want to live anymore"" is an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive, which falls under the criteria for suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The statement expresses a current, ongoing feeling (""I don't want to live anymore""). There are no specific immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now.""
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I don't want to live anymore"") but no specific plan or method. According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I don't want to live anymore"" is an explicit expression of death wishes.
*   No plan or method is mentioned, ruling out BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, ruling out ATTEMPT.
*   Since there is an explicit death wish, it is not INDICATOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The user quotes ""If you are actually suicidal"" and then expresses extreme anger at this statement, implying they *are* suicidal and are being dismissed. They also use phrases like ""just ended it silently"" (referring to suicide) and ""They won't believe it until I die."" The user is clearly expressing that they are experiencing suicidal thoughts/feelings and are struggling to ""hold on.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""trying to fucking hold on to whatever the hell I have left"" indicates a current, ongoing struggle. ""still need help"" is a current need. ""until I die"" refers to a potential future outcome, but in the context of their current distress.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I feel like killing my self every day"" and ""this might be my final good bye."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Every day"" indicates ongoing thoughts. ""this might be my final good bye"" suggests immediacy or imminent action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states, ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done."" This is a clear description of preparations for suicide (suicide note, organizing affairs), which constitutes a plan/preparation.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer,"" which indicates past contemplation or seeking help, but *not* a past completed suicide attempt. There is no description of a concrete action taken with intent to die in the past.

I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kms"" (kill myself) multiple times: ""i'm going to kms"", ""i'm going to kill myself very soon"", ""I'm about to kms"", ""kms soon"". It also mentions ""I can't get these thoughts out of my head"" referring to suicide thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post uses ""very soon"", ""about to"", and ""soon"", indicating a future but proximate intent. ""I'm about to explode"" indicates immediate distress. ""I can't stop cutting"" indicates ongoing behavior.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""I can't stop cutting."" This is a method of self-harm and a dangerous action. However, the post does not explicitly state that cutting is the *method* by which they intend to ""kms soon."" It's mentioned as a separate, ongoing struggle. No other specific suicide methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned *for the suicide intent*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""I can't stop cutting"" indicates ongoing self-harm behavior. This is an action that has occurred and continues to occur. No past *suicide attempts* (actions taken with intent to die) are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   It's not INDICATOR because there are multiple explicit mentions of suicide/killing self.
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die/commit suicide (""going to kms very soon"", ""about to kms"").
    *   The critical distinction is between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR. BEHAVIOR requires ""specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods."" While ""cutting"" is an action and a method of self-harm, the post does not explicitly link it as *the specific method* for the stated suicide intent (""I'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am.""). The cutting is presented as a separate, ongoing behavior they ""can't stop."" The primary suicidal intent is expressed without a specified *suicide* method.
    *   It's not ATTEMPT because no past *completed* suicide attempt is described. The cutting is ongoing self-harm, not a described past suicide attempt.
    *   Applying the ""When in Doubt"" rule: ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" The cutting is a method of self-harm, but not explicitly stated as the *suicide method* for the ""kms soon"" statements. The core of the statements about ""kms soon"" lack a specific method. Therefore, it aligns more closely with IDEATION as the intent is strong, but the *specific plan/method for suicide* is not detailed.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states: ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""ruin their lives by killing myself even more,"" ""one of my suicide notes,"" ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot,"" and ""the burden of my death."" This clearly identifies suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I wanna kill myself"" and ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"" indicate current desire. ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" indicates an immediate desire for a method. ""one of my suicide notes I threw away"" refers to a past preparation, but its discovery and the ongoing distress link it to current risk.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""one of my suicide notes I threw away"" is a clear preparation. Even if thrown away, it signifies that a note was written, indicating planning.
    *   ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" explicitly mentions a specific method (shooting) and a desire to act on it immediately.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions writing ""suicide notes"" which is a preparation, but not a completed attempt. There is no description of an actual suicide attempt (e.g., overdose, jumping, hanging) that occurred. The note was thrown away, and the shooting is a wish, not an action taken.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   Specific plans/methods/preparations are mentioned (suicide notes, shooting).
    *   No completed past suicide attempt is described.

    Based on the rules: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" The mention of ""suicide notes"" (preparation) and ""shoot myself"" (specific method) pushes this beyond mere ideation into the BEHAVIOR category. It is not an ATTEMPT as no completed action was taken.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""today"" indicates immediate intent. ""I'm going to OD"" indicates a current intention. ""now I'm back here"" reinforces the present state of suicidal thoughts.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific method (""OD"", ""popping all of them at once"") and specific means (""a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal""). The individual also states ""I have"" these medications, indicating preparation/possession of the means.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes current intent and ongoing thoughts, but does not describe any past completed suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""thinking about suicide"", ""going to OD"") AND a specific plan/method/preparation (overdose with specific medications, and possession of those medications). According to the decision logic, this classifies as BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: The intent is explicit (""going to OD"", ""thinking about suicide"").
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable, as it's a future intent, not a stopped past action.
*   Past vs. Present: The post describes a present intention and plan (""going to OD today""), not a completed past action.
*   When in Doubt: It clearly falls into BEHAVIOR because there are explicit thoughts *and* a specific plan/method/means. It's not IDEATION because of the detailed plan, and it's not ATTEMPT because it's a stated future intent, not a past completed action.

This constitutes an explicit expression of wanting to die/end life, fitting ""not wanting to be alive"" or ""want it to be over.""

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""It's late in the evening,"" ""I feel so bad,"" ""all I want to do"" indicate a current and immediate state of distress and desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a very specific and explicit method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of a past completed suicide attempt. ""I was already suicidal"" refers to a past mental state, not a past action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I was already suicidal"") AND a specific plan/method (""cutting my god damn throat""). According to the decision logic, this classifies as BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""cutting my god damn throat"" is an explicit expression of a death wish with a method.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable as it's presented as a desire.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** This is a stated desire for an action, not an action that was initiated and stopped.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The desire for the method is present.
*   **When in Doubt:**
    *   It's not INDICATOR because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It's not IDEATION because a specific method is mentioned.
    *   It's not ATTEMPT because no completed past action is described.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

227,"Quote about suicide. I recently stumbled upon this quote that said something along the lines of ""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going cause it doenst matter"" much more beautifully phrased thought. Anyone know more about it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill yourself,"" but these are within a quote that the user is asking about, not an expression of the user's own suicidal thoughts or desires. The user is asking for information about the quote itself (""Anyone know more about it?""), not expressing personal distress or suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** There are no urgency or timing indicators related to the user's own state or intent. The post is a neutral inquiry about a quote.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No plan or method is mentioned by the user for themselves.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm behaviors are mentioned by the user for themselves.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The critical rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned"" is crucial here. While the *quote* contains suicidal language, the *user* is not expressing their own desire to die or commit suicide. They are merely referencing and inquiring about a quote.
    *   The post does not express any explicit suicide/death wishes *from the user*. It is a factual inquiry about a quote.
    *   Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for IDEATION (explicit expression of wanting to die *by the user*), BEHAVIOR (plan/method *by the user*), or ATTEMPT (past action *by the user*).
    *   The lowest risk category, INDICATOR, is defined as ""Posts expressing distress, hopelessness, or general dissatisfaction with life WITHOUT any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die."" While this post doesn't even express distress *from the user*, it is the only category that fits a post where the user themselves is not expressing suicidal risk, even if the topic of suicide is mentioned in a secondary context (a quote). The user's own risk is not elevated.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i want to leave earth,"" ""i always end up wanting to die,"" and ""i'm ready to join my dog."" These are clear expressions of wanting to die/end life. ""I want to leave earth"" and ""I'm ready to join my dog"" fall under explicit death wishes, similar to ""want to be gone"" or ""being dead.""

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""i want to leave earth"" and ""now i'm ready to join my dog"" indicate a current and immediate desire/readiness. ""i always end up wanting to die"" indicates an ongoing pattern that culminates in the current state.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons), specific locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research about methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does not describe any past suicide attempts (""I tried to,"" ""I overdosed"") or interrupted attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes ARE mentioned (""want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog""). Therefore, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts ARE present, but there is NO plan/method/preparation mentioned. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   It is not BEHAVIOR because no specific plan, method, or preparation is described.
    *   It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed suicide action is described.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Rule 1 (Explicit vs. Implicit): ""i want to leave earth"" and ""i'm ready to join my dog"" are considered explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   Rule 5 (When in Doubt): Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit death/suicide mention. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION as no method/plan is mentioned.

229,"My grandpa passed away tonight. I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit. Now, I know I can't do that. My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" This is a clear mention of suicide. The phrase ""his passing has saved my life for the time being"" also implicitly confirms a prior suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The suicidal intent (""I was going to kill myself"") is described as a *past* decision (""I had previously made up my mind""). The current state is ""Now, I know I can't do that"" and ""his passing has saved my life for the time being,"" indicating a *current cessation* of that immediate intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific plan: ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" This includes a timing element (""before Christmas hit"") and the decision (""made up my mind""), which constitutes a plan, even without a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past *attempt* (completed action) is described. The post describes a *past plan* that was *not* acted upon.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide wishes were mentioned, so not INDICATOR.
    *   A plan (""was going to kill myself before Christmas hit"") was mentioned, so it goes beyond mere IDEATION.
    *   The post describes explicit suicidal thoughts and a plan (""I was going to kill myself""). This fits the BEHAVIOR category.
    *   No completed action was described, so not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""I was going to kill myself"" is explicit.
*   ""Intrusive Thoughts"": This was a decided plan, not just intrusive thoughts.
*   ""Interrupted Actions"": No action was initiated and then interrupted. The *plan* was averted before initiation.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": While the *current* intent is to *not* act, the post *describes* a past state that clearly falls under BEHAVIOR (explicit suicidal thoughts + a plan). The prompt asks to classify the *post*, which contains this information. The rule ""Even if the person says they don't want to act on thoughts, explicit mention of suicide/death still counts"" supports classifying based on the explicit content mentioned, even if current intent is mitigated.
*   ""When in Doubt"": ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" A plan was mentioned (""was going to kill myself before Christmas hit"").

Therefore, despite the current lack of intent, the post describes a past situation that meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR due to the explicit mention of a plan to kill oneself. The content of the post itself contains BEHAVIOR-level information.

230,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""think about suicide,"" ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" and ""actually want to commit suicide."" This confirms explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The thoughts occurred ""for the whole month of February,"" ""When we fight I always think about suicide"" (ongoing/recurring), and ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"" (current action/behavior). The desire to commit suicide is present (""actually want to commit suicide"").

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"" is a direct indicator of seeking methods and falls under ""research about suicide methods"" as per the BEHAVIOR category definition. This is more than just a thought; it's an active step towards a plan.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of a past *completed* suicide attempt (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I tried to hang myself""). The research is a current behavior, not a past attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific action related to planning/method (researching ways to kill self) is described. This moves it beyond simple ideation.
    *   No completed past attempt is described.

    Therefore, based on the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts AND research into methods, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""death."" The phrase ""Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being."" implies a desire for an end to current existence and a transition to a state of non-being, which aligns with wanting to be dead or not alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** There are no immediate urgency indicators (""tonight,"" ""now""). The statements are general beliefs and desires.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""suicide,"" ""death,"" desire for non-existence). However, there is no plan or method. Therefore, it falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Death and suicide"" are explicit. The desire for a state of non-being after ""Life is useless"" is an explicit expression of wanting to be gone/dead.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""suicide"" and ""death"" moves it past INDICATOR. The absence of a plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""the thought of death"" and describes it as ""beautiful"" in the context of ""never feel pain anymore,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""to be nothing,"" and ""to let go."" This is a clear expression of a desire for death or non-existence as an escape from suffering.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post discusses a general contemplation (""Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?""). It's not immediate (""tonight,"" ""now"") nor a past event (""I tried""). It's an ongoing reflection.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging), locations (bridges), preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""thought of death,"" desire for non-existence to escape pain). However, there is NO plan, method, or preparation mentioned. According to the framework, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""thought of death"" and the associated desire for cessation of pain is explicit.
*   ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION"": It's IDEATION because there is an explicit death mention.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" and ""the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore."" It also says ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day,"" which is a clear death wish. ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer"" reinforces this.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The decision is tied to ""tomorrow"" when the covid test results come in. ""don't think i can hold onto it any longer"" indicates immediate distress and urgency.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a conditional plan: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" It also states ""i'll use any method i can,"" which indicates a readiness to find and use a method, fitting ""seeking information about suicide methods"" or ""acquiring means"" conceptually, even if a specific method isn't named. The *decision to act* based on a trigger is a significant step towards a plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm are mentioned. The statements are about future actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts: Yes.
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes, a conditional plan (""if I'm positive, I'll kill myself"") and a stated intent to use ""any method I can"" to achieve this. This goes beyond mere ideation by including a trigger-based decision and a commitment to finding a method.
    *   This is not an ATTEMPT as it describes a future action, not a past completed one.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" is explicit.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes a future, conditional action.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly falls between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR. Since a conditional plan is stated (""if I'm positive, I'll kill myself"") and there's an intent to use ""any method,"" it moves into BEHAVIOR. The rule states: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" The ""any method"" implies seeking/readiness for a method.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" multiple times (""I cant fucking kill myself ptoperlly"", ""What shoul i do kill mslef""). It also expresses a desire to ""stop being a burden and a disappoinment,"" which is linked to the suicidal thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" indicates a past action. ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" indicates current ideation and seeking future action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific method: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"". This is a concrete method used in a past action. The question ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" also implies seeking a method for future action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing."" clearly describes a past suicide attempt (an overdose with intent to die, even if it didn't succeed in ending life). The phrase ""I cant fucking kill myself ptoperlly"" confirms this was an attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a past suicide attempt (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone""). According to the rules, ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" The presence of a concrete past action with intent to die (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"") overrides current ideation or seeking new methods for classification.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit suicide mention.
*   Intrusive Thoughts: Not applicable, this is direct action/desire.
*   Interrupted Actions: This was an action taken, not just initiated and stopped without completing the action (e.g., putting a noose on, but not taking pills). Taking an entire bottle of pills is a completed action for an attempt, regardless of outcome.
*   Past vs. Present: The dominant element is the description of a past attempt.
*   When in Doubt: The presence of a past attempt (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"") clearly points to ATTEMPT.

**Final Classification based on rules:** The post describes a past completed suicide attempt.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I might kill myself."" This directly indicates suicide content. Phrases like ""I feel like I don't belong in society"" and ""feeling like I'm trying to navigate through Hell every fucking day"" indicate distress and hopelessness but are not explicit suicide content on their own. The presence of ""I might kill myself"" is the key.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I might kill myself"" indicates a current thought and potential future action, but doesn't specify immediate urgency like ""tonight"" or ""now."" It's a present contemplation.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm going to end it tonight"" and ""I will be non existent,"" which are clear expressions of wanting to end life and not wanting to be alive. ""Goodbye world"" also reinforces this.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes"" indicate immediate and current urgency.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post specifies ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil."" This is a clear and specific method (pills) and quantity.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a *future* intended action (""I'm going to end it tonight,"" ""I will be non existent""). It does not describe a *past completed* suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present. A specific plan/method is present. This aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR. It is not ATTEMPT because it describes an imminent future action, not a past completed one.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit death wishes are present.
*   Past vs. Present: This describes an immediate present intent to act in the future, not a past completed action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i want to kill myself."" This is a direct expression of a death wish and suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""i want to kill myself"" indicates a current desire or state. The context about ""last year"" describes past misery, but the suicidal ideation is present-tense.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plan (e.g., how, when, where), method (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" multiple times, ""should die,"" ""deserve to die,"" and ""will end myself."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post mentions ""on my birthday in two weeks"" as a specific future timing for the planned action. It also references a past event: ""my first failed attempt in October.""
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states, ""My initial plan was to kill myself anyways on my birthday"" and ""And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks."" This constitutes a specific plan (when the action will occur), even if a specific method isn't detailed. The `BEHAVIOR` category includes ""specific plans.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states, ""after my first failed attempt in October."" This describes a past completed suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The presence of explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""end myself"") means it's not INDICATOR.
    *   The presence of a specific plan (date: ""on my birthday in two weeks"") means it moves beyond pure IDEATION and into BEHAVIOR.
    *   Crucially, the post describes a past completed suicide attempt (""my first failed attempt in October""). The `ATTEMPT` category definition states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" This rule directly applies here, as a past attempt is mentioned alongside a current plan.

Therefore, despite the presence of current plans (BEHAVIOR), the explicit mention of a past completed attempt dictates the classification as ATTEMPT based on the critical rule.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""my last suicide attempt"" and ""My suicidal thoughts"". It also mentions ""I think about death"".
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Today hits one month from my last suicide attempt"" indicates a past event with a current reflection on recovery. ""My suicidal thoughts kinda left. And by kinda I mean they are gone."" indicates a current positive state regarding thoughts.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses severe distress, tiredness, inability to enjoy things, and ""awful thoughts."" However, it explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" It does not contain any explicit phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" or similar direct expressions of wanting to end life. While ""awful thoughts"" could broadly encompass suicidal ideation, the lack of explicit suicidal phrasing and the direct negation of a plan to hurt self means it doesn't meet the ""explicit mention"" criteria for IDEATION.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current and ongoing distress (""I can't take it anymore,"" ""My eyes are burning,"" ""I'm so tired,"" ""I've been drowning in these awful thoughts""). There is no urgency related to an immediate suicidal act.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" There are no mentions of specific methods, locations, preparations, or research.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and general dissatisfaction with life.
    *   It *does NOT* contain any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die.
    *   It explicitly states the *absence* of a plan to hurt self.
    *   Based on the framework: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The post does not explicitly state a death wish. The ""awful thoughts"" are not explicitly defined as suicidal thoughts, and the direct statement ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"" reinforces the lack of explicit suicidal intent or desire.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The phrase ""drowning in these awful thoughts"" is not equivalent to ""my brain tells me to kill myself,"" which would trigger IDEATION. It's more general distress.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: There is *no explicit death/suicide mention*. Therefore, INDICATOR is the correct classification.

241,"I'm so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive. Yesterday my mom woke me up after work and I was having a dream and after I woke up I felt so fucking angry. I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual! Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me or some stupid shit I don't even know why I typed this out",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""I fucking hate being alive."" - Explicit expression of not wanting to be alive.
    *   ""I want to die or reverse time"" - Explicit wish to die.
    *   ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time"" - Explicit mention of frequent suicidal thoughts.
    *   ""I haven't died because of the old 'your parents will be sad dummy' thing."" - Acknowledges suicidal thoughts and a reason for not acting on them.
    *   ""Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me"" - Expresses a wish for death, even if by external means, indicating a strong desire for an end to life.
    *   ""the embarrassment would kill me"" - This is a hyperbolic phrase, not a literal death wish.
    *   ""the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands."" - This is an expression of extreme aversion, not a literal self-harm or suicide wish.
    *   ""I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself"" - This is ideation of self-harm, but the user explicitly states ""I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself."" This is *imagined* self-harm, not a plan or action, and not explicitly a suicide method.

    *Conclusion:* Multiple explicit mentions of wanting to die, hating being alive, and thinking about dying.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""I fucking hate being alive."" (Current, ongoing)
    *   ""I want to die or reverse time"" (Current, ongoing)
    *   ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time"" (Ongoing, pervasive)
    *   ""Laying in bed as usual! Hopefully the roof collapses..."" (Current state, wish for immediate end)
    *   ""Yesterday my mom woke me up..."" and ""I was hospitalized in highschool..."" refer to past events but are context for the current, ongoing distress and suicidal ideation.

    *Conclusion:* Strong indicators of current and ongoing suicidal thoughts and wishes.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging, weapons) is mentioned.
    *   No specific locations for suicide are mentioned.
    *   No preparations (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means) are described.
    *   No seeking information about suicide methods is mentioned.
    *   The imaginings of self-harm are explicitly stated as not acted upon and are not presented as a suicide plan. The wishes for external events (roof collapse, mattress eating them) are passive wishes for death, not active plans for suicide.

    *Conclusion:* No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is present.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression"" - This indicates a history of severe mental health issues, but it is not explicitly stated as a suicide *attempt*.
    *   ""I've never purposely hurt myself"" - Explicitly denies past self-harm actions.
    *   No mention of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to,"" ""I overdosed"").

    *Conclusion:* No history of suicide attempts is described.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide/death wishes (""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every day"", ""I fucking hate being alive""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   The post does NOT contain specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. This rules out BEHAVIOR.
    *   The post does NOT describe a past completed suicide attempt. This rules out ATTEMPT.

    *Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.*

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I want to die"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The self-harm imaginings are intrusive thoughts, but the primary classification relies on the explicit suicide wishes without a plan.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The core suicidal content (""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every day"") is present.
*   **When in Doubt:**
    *   Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Explicit death/suicide mention present -> IDEATION.
    *   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: No method/plan mentioned -> IDEATION.
    *   Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: No completed past actions -> Not ATTEMPT.

The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight."" This is a clear expression of wanting to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tonight"" indicates immediate timing. ""i'm really hoping"" indicates a current desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""die in my sleep"" describes a desired *outcome* or *circumstance* of death, not an active *plan*, *method*, or *preparation* being undertaken by the individual. There's no mention of acquiring means (e.g., pills), specific actions (e.g., jumping), or preparations (e.g., notes). It's a passive wish for death to occur naturally.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""hoping I will die in my sleep tonight""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations being described. Wishing to die in sleep is a passive desire, not an an active method like taking pills, jumping, or hanging. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   It does not describe a past completed action, ruling out ATTEMPT.

    Applying the ""When in Doubt"" rule:
    *   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: The key distinction is ""specific plans, methods, or preparations."" Wishing to die in sleep is a desire for a passive death, not an active plan or method that the person intends to execute or prepare for. Therefore, it falls under IDEATION. If it said ""I'm going to take all my pills to die in my sleep,"" that would be BEHAVIOR. But ""hoping I will die in my sleep"" is a wish without an active method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Zoloft overdose"" and ""wasn't enough to kill me,"" clearly indicating an intent to die/kill self.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes a past action: ""at 11:30 I took 6 pills."" The event (taking the pills with suicidal intent) has already occurred.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method is mentioned: ""Zoloft overdose"" and ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg."" This is a concrete method and action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""I took 6 pills... wasn't enough to kill me"" describes a past completed action (taking the pills) with the intent to die. This is a past suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a concrete action taken in the past with the intent to die. This directly aligns with the definition of an ATTEMPT. The fact that it ""wasn't enough to kill me"" means the outcome was not fatal, but it was still an action taken with suicidal intent.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""wasn't enough to kill me"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** This was not merely interrupted; the pills were ingested. It was an *attempt*, not just an initiation that was stopped before completion.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The entire post describes a past event and its immediate aftermath.
*   **When in Doubt:** This is clearly an ATTEMPT as it describes a completed past action with intent to die.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" ""At peace knowing it's soon,"" and ""no way I'm living."" These are all explicit expressions of wanting to end life. ""Hope my plan works"" also clearly refers to a suicide plan.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" and ""it's soon"" indicate a current decision with immediate or near-future intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""Hope my plan works though"" explicitly states the existence of a plan. While details of the method are not provided, the *mention* of a plan is sufficient.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts. The post is forward-looking (""destined to do it,"" ""it's soon"").
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A plan is explicitly mentioned (""my plan"").
    *   It is not a description of a past completed attempt.
    *   According to the rules: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" The mention of ""my plan"" falls under ""plan.""
    *   The critical rule ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned"" confirms this.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum."" This is a direct mention of ""suicide.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The desire to find a forum is current (""I just want to find"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** Wanting to ""find an actual suicide forum"" falls under ""research/seeking"" and specifically ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" as defined in the BEHAVIOR category. While not a specific method or location, it is a preparatory step towards acquiring information related to suicide methods or plans.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide content is present (""suicide forum""). The desire to find a ""suicide forum"" constitutes ""seeking information about suicide methods,"" which is a criterion for the BEHAVIOR category. It goes beyond mere ideation by indicating a step towards planning or research.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""suicide forum"" is explicit.
*   **Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR:** The post mentions seeking a ""suicide forum,"" which directly aligns with ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" under the BEHAVIOR definition. This elevates it from mere ideation (wanting to die) to a behavioral indicator (taking a step towards researching or planning).
*   **Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT:** No past completed attempts are described.

Based on the explicit mention of ""suicide"" and the act of ""seeking information about suicide methods"" (by wanting to find a forum), the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""slash my wrists and die"" and ""want an end,"" which are clear expressions of wanting to die and end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die"" indicates immediate and current intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method is mentioned: ""slash my wrists.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""on the verge of trying"" indicates a current strong intent or contemplation of action, not a past completed attempt. ""I tried, I guess"" in the beginning refers to something else (getting away from parents, getting comfort), not a suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts (""die"", ""want an end"") are present, AND a specific plan/method (""slash my wrists"") is mentioned. This aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""slash my wrists and die"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** ""on the verge of trying"" describes a state immediately preceding an action, or a strong intent to act, which falls under BEHAVIOR (plan + imminent action). It's not a completed past attempt.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The suicidal intent and method (""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die"") are present/imminent.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly has explicit thoughts and a method, so it's not IDEATION. It's not a *completed* past action, so it's not ATTEMPT. It fits BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I cannot wait to die"" and ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it."" This clearly indicates a wish to die and preparation for it.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I cannot wait to die"" indicates a current, strong desire. ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" indicates a planned future action related to their death.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned. However, ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" constitutes a *preparation* for death, which is a key criterion for BEHAVIOR. It's a logistical step being considered or planned in anticipation of dying.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I cannot wait to die""). It also contains a clear *preparation* for death (""ill fix all of the funeral costs""). According to the definition, ""BEHAVIOR"" includes ""preparations (acquiring means, writing notes)"". While not acquiring means, preparing for funeral costs is a form of preparation for the act of dying and its aftermath. This moves it beyond mere ideation into the realm of concrete planning/preparation.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I cannot wait to die"" is explicit.
*   The mention of ""funeral costs"" is a concrete preparation, aligning with the ""BEHAVIOR"" definition.
*   It is not a past completed action, so not ATTEMPT.
*   It is more than just a thought, as it involves a logistical preparation, so it's not just IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post asks ""what's really the point?"" and describes being ""destined to live a depressed life."" While this expresses deep despair and a lack of purpose, it does *not* explicitly mention suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive. It does not use phrases like ""going to die,"" ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" or ""want it to be over"" in a direct sense of wanting to die. The phrase ""what's really the point?"" is a rhetorical question about meaning, not a direct statement of suicidal intent or desire for death.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes a general, ongoing state of hopelessness (""won't ever be as good again,"" ""destined to live a depressed life""). There are no immediate or urgent indicators.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""jump from a bridge"" and ""highest chance of death,"" clearly indicating a desire to end life. Phrases like ""hopefully everything pans out the way I want"" in this context also point to a desired outcome of death.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post states ""by the weekend"" and ""I'm gonna pick one,"" indicating a specific, near-future timeline for action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user asks ""what's the best bet if I where to jump from a bridge which one do I have the highest chance of death."" This is a clear indication of seeking information/research about specific methods (jumping) and locations (bridges) to maximize lethality. The phrase ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"" signifies a concrete plan to choose a specific bridge.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm actions. The post focuses on future intent and planning.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""highest chance of death"") AND specific plans/methods/preparations/research (""jump from a bridge,"" asking for ""best bet"" and ""highest chance of death,"" ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend""). This aligns directly with the definition of BEHAVIOR. It is not IDEATION because a method and research for a plan are present. It is not ATTEMPT because no completed past action is described.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit death wish and method mentioned.
*   Past vs. Present: Focus is on present planning for future action.
*   When in Doubt: Clearly falls into BEHAVIOR due to explicit method, location, and research/planning.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped in pain: ""I am here to live in pain,"" ""The pain will never loosen it's grip.""
    *   However, it explicitly states: ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free."" This is a crucial phrase. It signifies a belief that the suffering is eternal and death is not an escape, rather than a wish *to* die or *to* end life. It directly contradicts a death wish.
    *   There is no explicit mention of suicide, killing self, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive.
    *   No phrases like ""going to die"" (in a self-inflicted sense), ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" ""want it to be over."" The phrase ""I will never be free"" is about being unable to escape the pain, not about wanting to end life via death.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   The post describes a current, ongoing state of despair and suffering (""This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain."").
    *   No indicators of immediate intent or past actions related to suicide.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   No past attempts or self-harm behaviors are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Based on step 1, there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned. The statement ""I am convinced that I will never die"" is a key indicator against a death wish.
    *   Therefore, the classification should be INDICATOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** There are no explicit death wishes. The distress is severe but not directed towards ending life. The phrase ""I will never die"" specifically goes against a death wish.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose INDICATOR because there is *no* explicit death/suicide mention. The post describes profound distress and hopelessness, but no desire to end life.

**Conclusion:** The post expresses deep emotional pain, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped, but it does not contain any explicit statements of wanting to die or commit suicide. In fact, the phrase ""I am convinced that I will never die"" suggests a despair about the *inability* to escape pain, rather than a desire for death.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

    *   ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."" (referring to sleep) - This is an implicit but clear desire for non-existence/death.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, explicit suicide/death wishes and past actions are present for the person writing the post.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" - Indicates current feelings.
    *   ""I've struggled... including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" - Indicates a past event.
    *   ""But now I find myself in a different place."" - Indicates a current state.
    *   Conclusion: Both past actions and current ideation are present.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post mentions a past ""aborted attempt"" but does not describe the method used in that past attempt, nor does it describe any *current* specific plans, methods, preparations, or research for suicide.
    *   Conclusion: No current plan/method/preparation.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" - This is a direct description of the user's own past action.
    *   According to the Critical Classification Rules, ""Interrupted actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" An ""aborted attempt"" fits this definition of an interrupted action.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, a past interrupted attempt is explicitly mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide ideation (""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"").
    *   The post describes a past ""aborted attempt at suicide.""
    *   Referencing the Critical Classification Rules:
        *   ""Interrupted actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT.""
        *   An ""aborted attempt"" clearly falls under the definition of an interrupted action.
    *   Therefore, even though there is current ideation, the explicit mention of a past interrupted action classifies the post as BEHAVIOR. This is a higher risk category than just ideation and accurately reflects the past action taken.

Just to bring me back to nothing. No matter how hard I struggle, not matter how much I plan, in the end, it doesn't matter. There's not hope anymore. There's no joy anymore. There's no emotion anymore. No sadness, its just nothing. The pain in numb now, but that's nothing new. I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess. I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I plan on doing it"". This is a direct expression of intent to end life. Other phrases like ""I can't continue this disappointment,"" ""There's not hope anymore,"" and ""No emotion anymore"" indicate severe distress and hopelessness, supporting the suicidal intent. The farewell message ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best"" also strongly points to suicidal intent.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I plan on doing it"" indicates a current, immediate intention.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess."" This is a specific location and implies a specific method (e.g., cutting wrists, drowning) chosen for a particular outcome (""less of a mess""). This constitutes a clear plan and method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts. The focus is on a current plan.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I plan on doing it"").
    *   A specific plan/method/preparation is present (""in the tub"", ""less of a mess"").
    *   Based on the definitions, ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable, this is a stated plan, not an action that was started and stopped.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes a present plan, not a past action.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts *and* a specific plan/method clearly places it in the BEHAVIOR category. It's not an ATTEMPT because it describes a future action, not a completed past one.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses distress (""I just want the pain to go away"") and a need for comfort (""Can someone just hug me please""). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, or phrases like ""going to die,"" ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" or ""want it to be over."" The phrase ""I just want the pain to go away"" is a general expression of suffering, not an explicit death wish.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Just want"" indicates a current state of distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No plan, method, location, preparations, or research is mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm behaviors are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, according to the decision logic, this post falls under INDICATOR.
    *   Critical Rule Check: ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": The phrase ""I just want the pain to go away"" is not considered an explicit expression of a death wish in the same way ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I want to be gone"" would be. It's a general desire for relief.
    *   ""When in Doubt"": Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention. There is no explicit death/suicide mention here. Therefore, INDICATOR is the correct classification.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" - Explicit mention of ending life.
    *   ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" - Explicit mention of wanting to end life.
    *   ""I wish I was dead"" - Explicit death wish.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""IM GOING TO END IT."" - Indicates current intent/desire.
    *   ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" - Indicates current/ongoing thoughts.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific method (e.g., ""I'm going to take pills,"" ""I'm going to jump"") is mentioned for the stated intent to ""end it.""
    *   No specific location or preparations are mentioned for the stated intent to ""end it.""
    *   The post mentions past ""Taking pain killers and antidepressants... secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system"". This describes past self-harm/addictive behavior with severe consequences, but it is framed as a *coping mechanism* and *addiction*, not as a *suicide method* or a *suicide attempt* with intent to die. The intent for these actions was coping, not ending life. There is no current plan to use paracetamol to ""end it.""

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   The paracetamol abuse is described as a past harmful behavior for coping/addiction, not a past *suicide attempt* (an action taken with the intent to die). The post does not state ""I tried to kill myself by taking paracetamol.""

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present: Yes (""going to end it,"" ""wanting to end it,"" ""I wish I was dead"").
    *   Specific plan/method for *suicide* is present: No. The past paracetamol abuse is not presented as a current suicide plan or a past suicide attempt.
    *   Past suicide attempt (completed action with intent to die): No.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases ""going to end it"" and ""wanting to end it"" are explicit.
*   **Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR:** The post explicitly states a desire to end life but *lacks a specific plan or method* for *suicide*. The mention of past paracetamol abuse is described as a coping mechanism/addiction, not a suicide method or attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of IDEATION. If a specific method for the *current* intent to ""end it"" had been mentioned (e.g., ""I'm going to end it by taking all my paracetamols""), it would be BEHAVIOR. But it doesn't.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and wishes without a specific plan or method for *suicide*. The past harmful actions are described as addiction/coping, not suicide attempts.

I was getting over my suicidal thoughts when I was with him, but now they're coming back. I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head. We both unfollowed each other on social media and deleted our conversations. He said he was crying. I felt like crying. I feel like cutting myself again. Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I really want to fucking kill myself."" It also mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" returning and ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" The phrase ""I feel like cutting myself again"" also indicates self-harm tendencies, which are relevant to risk.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language ""I really want to fucking kill myself"" and ""I'm thinking about running away..."" indicates current and immediate intent/planning. ""Now they're coming back"" refers to current thoughts.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A very specific plan is articulated: ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" This includes a specific method (train crushing head) and a specific location (train station near my house).

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"" and ""I feel like cutting myself again,"" implying past suicidal thoughts and past self-harm. However, it does *not* describe a past *completed* suicide attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""I really want to fucking kill myself"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation mentioned: Yes (specific method and location for suicide by train).
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action): No. It mentions past suicidal thoughts and past self-harm, but not a completed suicide *attempt*.

    Based on the rules:
    *   It's not INDICATOR because there are explicit suicide mentions.
    *   It's not IDEATION because there is a specific plan/method mentioned.
    *   It fits the definition of BEHAVIOR because it has explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods (train tracks, train).
    *   It's not ATTEMPT because no *completed* past action is described. The mention of ""cutting myself again"" is a self-harm urge, not a past completed suicide attempt. The train scenario is a current *thought/plan*, not a past action.

    Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I have wanted to die,"" ""I had a few suicide attempts,"" ""be able to kill myself,"" and ""the world lets me die."" This clearly indicates suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Every day for 4,808. I have wanted to die"" indicates an ongoing desire. ""I had a few suicide attempts"" and ""the most successful attempt involved me being saved"" clearly refer to past events.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no *current* specific plan or method mentioned for a *future* suicide action. The ""thorazine drip"" is a desire for a state of being, not a suicide method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states ""I had a few suicide attempts"" and details ""the most successful attempt involved me being saved."" This is a clear description of past completed actions.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes past suicide attempts (completed actions). According to the rules, if it describes a past suicide attempt, it falls under ATTEMPT. The presence of ongoing ideation (""I have wanted to die"") does not override the explicit mention of past attempts.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit death wishes and past attempts are present.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The description ""being saved"" implies the attempt was a concrete action that occurred.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The core of the classification here is the clear description of *past completed suicide attempts*.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""trying to end my own life,"" ""I'm going to try again."" These are clear and explicit expressions of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm going to try again"" indicates future intent. ""tommorow maybe,"" ""next week, maybe next month, maybe next year"" indicate consideration of timing for a future action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" While not naming a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), it describes characteristics of a specific *type* of method, implying a considered plan. This points towards BEHAVIOR.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post states, ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real,"" ""I feel the pain of trying to end my own life,"" ""I feel anger of not being able to get over my own survival instincts,"" and crucially, ""I feel shame for failing."" The phrase ""I'm going to try again"" directly implies past attempts. The ""shame for failing"" confirms past completed actions that were attempts, even if unsuccessful.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A future plan with a described method characteristic is present (BEHAVIOR).
    *   Crucially, past *attempts* are explicitly mentioned (""shame for failing,"" ""I'm going to try again"" after previous attempts).
    *   According to the Critical Classification Rules, ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" The post clearly describes past actions (""failing"" at trying to end life) that qualify as attempts, even if unsuccessful.

Therefore, despite the future planning, the explicit mention of past completed attempts (even if failed) leads to the ATTEMPT classification.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" is a clear and explicit expression of wanting to end their life. ""It's over"" also contributes to a sense of finality and hopelessness often associated with suicidal thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""All I want is courage to end it"" indicates a current desire. ""It's over"" implies a current state of despair.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). It only expresses the desire to ""end it"" and the need for ""courage"" to do so.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide/death wishes (""All I want is courage to end it"") but does *not* include any specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the framework, this falls under IDEATION.
6.  **Critical Classification Rules Check:**
    *   ""end it"" is explicit in this context, confirming it's not just an INDICATOR.
    *   There is no plan or method, so it's not BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm going out of this world"" and ""I'm offing myself then."" It also includes ""Goodbye world,"" which is a farewell statement indicative of ending life. Therefore, explicit suicide content is present.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post provides a very specific future date and time: ""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours."" This indicates a clear, immediate future intention with a precise timeline.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** While no specific *method* (like pills or jumping) is mentioned, the post specifies a precise *date and time* for the intended action (""going out,"" ""offing myself""). This level of detail regarding *when* the act will occur constitutes a ""specific plan"" for its execution. The BEHAVIOR category includes ""specific plans.""

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a future intention (""I'm going out,"" ""I'm offing myself then""), not a past completed action. There is no mention of past attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide wishes are mentioned, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts (""offing myself"") are present.
    *   A specific plan (exact date and time for the act) is present.
    *   According to the rules, ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" The specific date and time for the act is a concrete plan.
    *   It's not an ATTEMPT because it describes a future action, not a completed past one.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I'm going out of this world"" and ""I'm offing myself"" are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   The post focuses on a future, planned action, not a past attempt or interrupted action.
*   The specificity of the date and time elevates it from mere ideation to planned behavior.

Therefore, the post fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR due to explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific plan (date and time) for its execution.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I dont want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefuly,"" ""I dont want to live like this,"" and most clearly, ""I want to kill myself so bad."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""Im done,"" ""I cant take it anymore,"" ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" and ""It will never be better"" indicate a current and ongoing state of distress and suicidal desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into suicide methods. The mention of getting drunk is a coping mechanism, not a suicidal plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""I want to die""). However, there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned. According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

""I have to make it stop"" in this context, following the previous statement and ""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause,"" refers to stopping their own existence to end the perceived negative impact and pain. This counts as an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive/wanting to be gone.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I just can't do this anymore"" and ""I have to make it stop"" indicate a current and urgent feeling.

262,"I lost everyone in my life. I lost all of my friends in a fight recently. They called me selfish and reckless and said that they were done with me.

I feel lost and alone and like no one understands me. I tried going to therapy but I couldn't bring myself to actually talk to him about how I feel because it hurts so much I can't even think about it anymore.

I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital. Both would just make this living hell even more unbearable. Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it. They wouldn't have to try and care for me anymore. I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better. I don't have anything to look forward to other than more mistakes and ruin.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital."" - Explicitly mentions the act of ""doing it"" (suicide) and the potential negative outcomes of an attempt.
    *   ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it."" - ""if I did it"" clearly refers to suicide.
    *   ""They wouldn't have to try and care for me anymore."" - Implies the person's absence/death.
    *   ""I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better."" - Strong expressions of not wanting to be alive and death as a better alternative.
    *   Conclusion: Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this."" - Indicates current, severe distress and proximity to a breaking point.
    *   ""I would have done it already"" - Indicates a past inclination that is still relevant and being held back by fear *now*.
    *   Conclusion: Current urgency and ongoing suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific method (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons) is mentioned.
    *   No specific location is mentioned.
    *   No preparations (notes, acquiring means, specific setups) are described.
    *   No research/seeking information about methods is mentioned.
    *   The phrase ""afraid of botching it"" refers to the *outcome* of an unspecified action, not a specific plan or method.
    *   Conclusion: No specific plan or method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I would have done it already"" indicates a *thought* or *inclination* to act in the past, but it explicitly states the person *did not* act due to fear (""if I wasn't so afraid""). It does not describe a completed action or an interrupted attempt.
    *   Conclusion: No past completed attempt or interrupted attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned (""if I did it"", ""ending up seriously hurt"" from a botched attempt). Therefore, it is not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts (""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it"") but NO specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   It does not include a specific plan/method/preparation, so it is not BEHAVIOR.
    *   It does not describe a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""if I did it"" and the context of ""botching it"" are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** This is not described as an intrusive thought the person is resisting, but rather a desire/inclination that is being held back by fear of negative consequences. It is still a clear suicidal thought.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** No interrupted action is described. ""I would have done it already"" is a hypothetical, not an action initiated and stopped.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes current distress and ongoing suicidal thoughts that are currently being restrained by fear.
*   **When in Doubt:** Fits IDEATION perfectly as there are explicit suicidal thoughts but no plan/method.

263,"Ramble about hating myself. Just joined but I have a problem. I'm a 30 year old Male single parent of a 7 about to be 8 year old son. I can afford my bills (barely) but we have food and a roof over our head. But even before he was born I have had depression. I'm sure his mom cheating on me and leaving us 4 years ago didn't help. ( Not doctor diagnosed but I assume do to always been looking at things as glass being empty and not wanting to live.) Now as I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life. Of course I will wait till he's an adult but I just can't seem to get my life together. Every job I have ever wanted I can't get because my experience is in different fields. Females don't like me because of the dad bod. I feel I'm at the point of just no success. I'm over being a failure. But I don't have motivation. I have tried but i just feel like a waste of space. This thing called a life is too much. I would say I'm suicidal but I don't have the balls to actually do it.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" and ""I would say I'm suicidal."" These are all direct mentions of suicide or death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The urgency is ongoing (""Now as I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable...""). The person states they ""will wait till he's an adult"" and ""11 more years then yes I could be there,"" indicating a future deferral of action, but the *thoughts* are present.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plan, method (pills, jumping, etc.), location, or preparation is mentioned. The user explicitly states, ""I don't have the balls to actually do it.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted attempts are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""I would say I'm suicidal"").
    *   NO specific plan or method is mentioned. In fact, the user explicitly states a *lack* of immediate intent to act (""I don't have the balls to actually do it"") and defers any potential action to the distant future.
    *   According to the framework, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The mentions are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** While there's a reason for not acting, the explicit mention ""I would say I'm suicidal"" still points to ideation.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The ideation is present, but the action is deferred to the future.
*   **When in Doubt:** This falls squarely between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR. Since there is *no* plan or method mentioned, and the user explicitly states they lack the means/courage to act *now*, it remains IDEATION. It does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR (which requires specific plans/methods/preparations).

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I just want off this life"" is an explicit expression of wanting to end life/not wanting to be alive. This clearly indicates suicidal content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm struggling to hold on"" and ""I just want off this life"" indicate a current, ongoing state of distress and desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I just want off this life"") but *no* specific plan or method. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I just want off this life"" is considered an explicit expression of a death wish.
*   No plan or method is present, so it doesn't escalate to BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, so it's not ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I need to kill myself"" and ""me killing myself."" It also says ""life just isn't worth it,"" which is an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I need to kill myself"" indicates a current, immediate desire. The question ""how do I minimise..."" suggests current contemplation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post asks ""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends."" This is a question about the *impact* or *consequences* of suicide, not a specific plan, method, location, or preparation for the act itself. There is no mention of pills, jumping, weapons, specific locations, acquiring means, or writing notes.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I need to kill myself""). However, there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The question about minimizing hurt to family/friends is about the emotional aftermath, not the physical means of suicide. Therefore, it fits the definition of IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I need to kill myself"" is explicit.
*   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: No specific method or plan is mentioned. The question is about the *impact* of the act, not the *method* of the act. This aligns with IDEATION.

It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" explicitly indicates a desire to end life or not be alive. According to the critical rules, ""I want to be gone"" is an explicit expression of death wishes. The context of hopelessness (""no point in trying anymore,"" ""tired of fighting"") reinforces this interpretation.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""By this time next week"" indicates a specific, near-future timeframe, suggesting current and imminent intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location (e.g., bridge), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). It states the outcome (""I'll be gone"") but not *how*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a future intention, not a past completed action or an interrupted attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned (""I'll be gone"").
    *   There is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    *   There is NO description of a past completed suicide attempt.
    *   This combination (explicit thoughts, no plan/method) aligns directly with the definition of **IDEATION**.
    *   Applying ""When in Doubt"" rules:
        *   Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION because there is an explicit death wish.

267,I hope I don't make it. I don't want to survive another attempt because all my parents will tell me is how expensive the medical bill is. I just want to die without having to hear them again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I don't want to survive another attempt,"" and ""I just want to die."" These are all clear expressions of wanting to die or not wanting to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I hope I don't make it"" and ""I just want to die"" indicate current desire. ""another attempt"" refers to a past event (an attempt has already occurred) and implies a potential future one, but the emphasis is on the *past occurrence* of an attempt.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plan, method, or preparation for a *new* suicide action is mentioned in the post.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""I don't want to survive **another attempt**"" is a direct and explicit indicator of a past suicide attempt. The word ""another"" confirms that at least one attempt has already happened.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a past suicide attempt (""another attempt""). According to the classification rules, if a post describes a past completed suicide attempt, it falls under ATTEMPT. Even though there's a current desire to die, the explicit mention of a past attempt takes precedence for classification as per the ""ATTEMPT"" definition and the ""When in Doubt"" rule (Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions). The critical rule ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT"" applies here, even though it's a current *desire* rather than a detailed *plan*. The key is the *past completed action*.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" and ""death is the only escape."" These are direct expressions of wanting to die or end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The thoughts are described as ""intense and are seemingly only getting more intense as the days pass."" The phrase ""I wake immediately with suicidal thoughts"" indicates a current, ongoing, and persistent state. ""Death is the only escape"" expresses a current belief/desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does NOT mention any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does NOT describe any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Suicidal thoughts"" and ""death is the only escape"" are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   The mention of ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" falls under explicit mention, even if not acted upon, confirming IDEATION.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide attempt,"" ""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" and ""intention of dying."" This clearly indicates suicide-related content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The events described (""in the past year or two,"" ""happened long enough ago"") are past events. The user is currently reflecting on them (""this question has been weighing on me,"" ""I'm in a tenuously better situation right now"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user describes ""testing my method"" and ""went until shortly before the point of no return."" This implies a specific method was used and initiated. For the second event, ""I went in with the intention of dying"" and ""Much like the first time I stopped myself"" also implies a method was initiated.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes two specific past events where the user ""went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped"" and ""stopped myself."" These are clear descriptions of *interrupted actions* or *interrupted attempts*.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.
    *   Specific methods were initiated (""testing my method,"" ""went until shortly before the point of no return"") and actions were taken (""stopped myself"").
    *   According to Critical Classification Rule 3, ""If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" Both described events fit this rule perfectly as they were initiated actions that were stopped.
    *   The definition of BEHAVIOR includes ""Interrupted attempts where action was initiated.""
    *   The definition of ATTEMPT requires ""past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome."" Since the user explicitly states they ""stopped"" themselves, these were not completed attempts.

Based on the analysis, particularly the clear description of initiated but interrupted actions, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family?

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I really want to die."" and ""Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone."" It also asks, ""So what do I have to live for?"", which implies a lack of desire to continue living.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The expressions of wanting to die are current and ongoing (""I really want to die,"" ""I'd rather die"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods. The phrase ""I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions"" is metaphorical and not a suicide method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes past negative life experiences (bullying, parental abuse, past actions of the self) but does not describe any past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""I really want to die,"" ""I'd rather die"").
    *   There is NO plan/method/preparation mentioned.
    *   There is NO past suicide attempt described.
    *   Therefore, the classification falls under IDEATION: ""explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I really want to die"" is an explicit expression of death wishes.
*   No interrupted actions or past attempts are described.
*   The post focuses on current feelings and desires.
*   Given explicit death wishes but no plan, IDEATION is the correct choice over INDICATOR or BEHAVIOR.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language ""contemplating,"" ""looking up,"" and ""I wish I had the courage"" indicates current thoughts and desires. There's no past attempt described.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""looking up how to do it,"" which indicates research/seeking information about methods. It also mentions specific methods: ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt. The person states they *wish* they had the courage, indicating no action has been taken yet.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present. Specific plans/methods/research are also present (""looking up how to do it,"" ""jump in front of a car,"" ""stab myself""). This combination fits the definition of BEHAVIOR. It is not an ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described. It is not IDEATION because specific methods and research are mentioned.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains several explicit expressions of not wanting to be alive: ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back."" Additionally, the phrase ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all. If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace"" is an explicit wish for death, even if collective. This clearly indicates explicit death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The expressions ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out,"" and ""I want to leave"" indicate a current and ongoing desire. There are no indicators of past attempts or specific immediate timing for action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plan or method for the individual's *own* suicide is mentioned. The wish for a ""nuclear bomb"" is a general desire for collective death, not a personal method the individual intends to employ for themselves. There are no specific locations, preparations, or research for personal suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all,"" ""If we all died at the same time... Rest In Peace"").
    *   No specific plan or method for personal suicide is mentioned. The nuclear bomb is a wish for an external, collective event, not a personal suicide method.
    *   Based on the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out,"" and ""I want to leave and never come back"" are explicit expressions of death wishes. The wish for a nuclear bomb to ""kill us all"" and ""Rest In Peace"" also falls under explicit death wishes.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit death wishes clearly moves this beyond INDICATOR. The absence of a personal plan or method (the nuclear bomb is a collective, external wish, not a personal method) means it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""pull the trigger"" specifies a method (using a firearm) to end life. This constitutes a specific plan/method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm. The action described is a future intention.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I want to die"") AND a specific plan/method (""pull the trigger""). According to the decision logic, this falls under BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I want to die"" and ""pull the trigger"" are explicit.
*   A specific method is mentioned, moving it past IDEATION.
*   It's a stated intention, not a past completed action, so not ATTEMPT.
*   Focus is on the person writing the post.

Based on the explicit suicidal thoughts and the mention of a specific method (""pull the trigger""), the classification is BEHAVIOR.

Not even one word of advice or help. And every time I couldn't hide my pain she says: ,Smile for once. Why don't you smile?"". It's like she doesn't care for my Problems. And at work my forearms with my wounds are visible for everyone to notice but they just say thinks like work faster, go to bed earlier( sleeping is really hard and I'm tired all the time). I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness. Death seems like the only place where I can be free.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" explicitly expresses a desire for death as a solution, fitting ""wanting to die"" or ""not wanting to be alive.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Death seems like the only place..."" indicates a current state of mind. ""I hurt myself two months ago"" refers to a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific plans, methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations, or research related to *suicide*. The past self-harm is not presented as a *current* suicide plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""I hurt myself two months ago"" indicates past self-harm behavior. However, the post does not state this self-harm was a ""suicide attempt"" with intent to die. It's described as ""hurting myself,"" which falls under ""self-harm behaviors"" in the framework, but not explicitly ""past attempts"" with suicidal intent.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There IS explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned (""Death seems like the only place...""), so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts (""Death seems like the only place..."") but NO plan/method for *suicide*. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   It does not describe a past *suicide attempt* (an action taken with intent to die), as the intent for the past self-harm is not specified as suicidal. It's ""I hurt myself,"" not ""I tried to kill myself.""

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" is an explicit expression of a death wish.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The past self-harm is not described as an interrupted *suicide* attempt.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The current desire for death is present. The self-harm is past and not explicitly a suicide attempt.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit death mention. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION because there is no *current* plan or method for suicide. Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT, not applicable as it's not BEHAVIOR. The past self-harm is not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt with intent to die, so it doesn't elevate to ATTEMPT.

The post clearly expresses a desire for death without detailing a specific plan or method for *suicide*. The past self-harm is noted but doesn't meet the criteria for a past *suicide attempt* (intent to die not stated) or a *current behavior* (no current plan).

275,"More than anything I want help and to get better, but I can't tell anyone. I just moved out of home, I live on campus now. I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much. At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much. I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""long conversations with myself about suicide,"" and ""I think about suicide every day."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current, ongoing feelings and actions: ""everyday,"" ""almost every day,"" ""every day."" This indicates present and ongoing risk.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly states, ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, the existence of ""detailed plans"" constitutes a specific plan or preparation, which is a key criterion for BEHAVIOR.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past suicide attempts or interrupted physical actions are described. The plans are current and written, not past physical attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Not INDICATOR because explicit suicide content is present.
    *   Not IDEATION because specific plans (""detailed plans in my journal"") are mentioned, which goes beyond just thoughts/wishes.
    *   It fits BEHAVIOR because there are explicit suicidal thoughts (""more suicidal I get,"" ""think about suicide every day"") AND specific plans/preparations (""I write detailed plans in my journal"").
    *   Not ATTEMPT because no past completed actions are described. The plans are current, not past attempts.
    *   The rule ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR"" applies directly. Even though the person says they ""would never do it,"" the presence of ""detailed plans"" is the determining factor for BEHAVIOR.

276,:(. I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses extreme distress (""I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal."") but does *not* contain any explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, or phrases like ""going to die,"" ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" ""want it to be over."" It conveys severe emotional pain and feeling overwhelmed, but not an explicit desire for death.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I cant take it anymore"" indicates a current, immediate feeling of distress. No timing for suicidal action is present.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, the post falls under the INDICATOR category. It describes distress and hopelessness without explicitly stating a desire to end life.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases used are indicators of severe distress and feeling overwhelmed, but they are not explicit expressions of wanting to die or be gone.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: There is no explicit death/suicide mention, confirming INDICATOR.

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide."" The phrase ""capable of commiting suicide"" clearly indicates suicidal thoughts and a perceived ability to act on them.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I think I'm capable"" indicates a current assessment of a potential future action. It's not a past event or a general ongoing feeling, but a present capability for a future act.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned. The word ""sober"" describes the state of mind, not a method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide content is present (""committing suicide"").
    *   No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   No past completed attempt is described.
    *   According to the framework: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"". This post fits this criterion.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""committing suicide"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** While not framed as ""my brain tells me,"" the statement ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide"" is an explicit articulation of suicidal thought.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** Focuses on current capability.
*   **When in Doubt:** Falls clearly into IDEATION as explicit suicide is mentioned without a method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrases ""Don't want tot. Do this anymore."" and ""I just want tit to be over."" clearly express a desire to end life or current suffering, which falls under ""not wanting to be alive"" or ""want it to be over."" The typo ""tit"" is understood as ""it"" in context of ""over."" ""I wasn't to be down"" likely means ""I want to be done"" or ""I want to be dead,"" reinforcing the desire for an end.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post expresses current feelings and desires (""Don't want to"", ""I just want"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific plans, methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations, or research mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide/death wishes (""want it to be over,"" ""don't want to do this anymore"") are present. However, there is no plan or method mentioned. This fits the definition of IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I just want tit to be over"" is an explicit expression of a death wish, fitting rule 1.
*   No plan or method is mentioned, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, so it's not ATTEMPT.
*   Since explicit death wishes are present, it's not INDICATOR.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" and ""I will use my suicide."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" indicates past actions. ""I will use my suicide"" indicates future intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions future intent (""I will use my suicide"") but does not specify a concrete method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location. It describes the *purpose* of the future suicide, but not the *how*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This is a direct description of past completed suicide attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes past suicide attempts (""I have attempted suicide 11 times""). According to the framework, if it describes a past suicide attempt (completed action), it falls under ATTEMPT. The critical classification rule ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT"" reinforces this. Even though there's a mention of future intent, the concrete past attempts are the defining factor.

280,"Welcome to the bottom of hell. Was in a bad break up 2 years ago that really messed me up. Fell into depression, stoped studying, flunked college. Managed to find a job, and then get fired 2 months after. Stalked my ex on Instagram for waaay to long which only made me feel more lonely, because she started traveling, made tons of new friends etc. While I found out I have no real friends anymore. The most fucked up thing is I still think about her every day. I've been in 2 short relationships since, but still, my mind won't let me forget her. Tried to kill myself 3 times by now. I've just given up completely. I just want the pain to end. I don't recognise myself any more",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This is a direct mention of suicide. Also, ""I just want the pain to end"" implies a desire for cessation of suffering, which in context of the suicide attempts, reinforces the suicidal ideation.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" clearly indicates past, completed actions. ""I've just given up completely"" and ""I just want the pain to end"" describe current feelings of hopelessness and despair, but the most severe action described is in the past.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific *current* plan or method for a *future* action is mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The statement ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" is a clear description of past suicide attempts. This directly matches the definition of the ATTEMPT category.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes ""past completed suicide attempts"" (""Tried to kill myself 3 times""). According to the classification rules, if a post describes past attempts, it falls under the ATTEMPT category. Even though there are current feelings of despair, the presence of past attempts takes precedence for classification.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Past vs. Present:** The most severe information is the past attempts. The rule states: ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" Here, there are past attempts and current distress/ideation, but no *current* plan. The past attempts are the highest risk indicator.
*   **Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT:** The phrasing ""Tried to kill myself 3 times"" denotes concrete actions that occurred in the past, fulfilling the criteria for ATTEMPT, rather than just plans or interrupted actions (BEHAVIOR).

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""how to accomplish death,"" ""don't want my head to explode via shotgun,"" ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth,"" ""A failed suicide,"" and ""End it now."" It also discusses ""don't kill yourself"" in a critical context. This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""End it now"" indicate immediate urgency. The discussion of methods and fear of accomplishing death suggests a current state of active consideration. ""I've looked into other options"" indicates past research relevant to current planning.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post details specific methods: ""shotgun,"" ""handguns"" with a specific target ""through my upper palate in my mouth,"" and ""overdosing"" (by referencing Mark Linkous and discussing the fear of paralysis from a failed overdose). The user is actively considering and researching these methods, discussing calibers and outcomes. This is a clear assessment of plans/methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post discusses ""Mark Linkous overdosing"" which is a reference to someone else's action, not the author's. While the author states ""I've looked into other options,"" this is research, not a past completed attempt. There is no description of a past *completed* suicide attempt by the author.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Not INDICATOR because there are explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes.
    *   Not IDEATION because there are specific plans, methods, and preparations/research mentioned (shotgun, handgun, overdose, looking into options, discussing caliber).
    *   It is BEHAVIOR because there are explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods/preparations/research about suicide methods.
    *   It is not ATTEMPT because the post does not describe a *completed past suicide attempt* by the author. The discussion of failed suicide is hypothetical or refers to others, not a recounting of their own past action. The ""End it now"" is an urging, not a description of an action already taken.

    Based on the rules, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with specific methods being discussed and researched (""shotgun,"" ""handguns...shooting myself through my upper palate,"" ""looked into other options,"" ""Mark Linkous overdosing"" as a consideration) places it firmly in the BEHAVIOR category.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die or not be alive. This counts as explicit suicide/death content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post expresses current feelings and desires (""Can't do any of it!"", ""Just don't want this anymore"", ""just wanna sleep""). This indicates a present state.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), specific locations, preparations, or research. ""Sleep and never ever wake up"" is a wish, not a concrete plan or method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up""). No plan or method is mentioned. Therefore, it falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is considered an explicit expression of death wishes.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" multiple times. This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""I want to die"" and ""Can someone please help me work out what to do"" indicate a current and ongoing state of distress and desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I want to die"") but does *not* include any specific plan or method. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid.

    *   ""I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over."" - Explicit wish for death/end of suffering.
    *   ""I don't want to be here"" - In context of distress, implies not wanting to be alive.
    *   ""makes me want to not exist"" - Explicit.
    *   ""I want to be done, I want to be out of this"" - In context, implies wanting life to end.
    *   ""I want to disappear."" - Implies not wanting to exist.
    *   ""I do not want to exist anymore."" - Explicit.
    *   Conclusion: Multiple explicit mentions of wanting to die, not exist, or for life to be over.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""right now"" - Current.
    *   ""I'm done"" - Current state.
    *   ""I just can't see a solution or a way out?"" - Current feeling.
    *   ""I want to be done, I want to be out of this"" - Current desire.
    *   Conclusion: The post expresses current and immediate feelings and desires.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""fight the urge to go wandering off into the night"" - This describes an urge to escape or act recklessly, but it is *not* a specific suicide method (like pills, jumping, hanging) or a specific plan/location for suicide. It's too vague to be classified as a ""specific plan, method, or preparation"" for suicide as defined in the BEHAVIOR category.
    *   No mention of specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons).
    *   No mention of specific locations (bridges, buildings, train tracks).
    *   No mention of preparations (notes, acquiring means, specific setups).
    *   No mention of research/seeking information about methods.

    *   Conclusion: No past action history.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**

    *   The post expresses explicit suicide thoughts but *does not* include specific plans, methods, or preparations. The urge to ""go wandering off into the night"" is not a specific suicide plan/method. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   It does not describe a past completed suicide attempt. This rules out ATTEMPT.
    *   Since there are explicit thoughts but no *specific* plan/method, it falls under IDEATION.

6.  **Critical Classification Rules Check:**

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide."" It also says, ""Everyday I'm battling to stay alive"" and ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive."" Furthermore, the user feels ""like people/the world would be better off without me."" These are all clear and explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, and not wanting to be alive.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The indicators are current and ongoing: ""these days,"" ""Everyday,"" ""Most days."" There is no indication of an immediate crisis (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") but the thoughts are persistent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""ideations of suicide"" but provides *no* specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""ideations of suicide,"" ""wish I wasn't alive,"" ""battling to stay alive,"" ""world would be better off without me""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts, but *no* specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt. This rules out ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, the classification is IDEATION, as it involves explicit expressions of wanting to die/suicide without a specific plan or method.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I wish I wasn't alive"" and ""world would be better off without me"" are explicit death wishes. ""Ideations of suicide"" is direct.
*   No interrupted actions or past attempts are described.
*   The post clearly fits the definition of IDEATION: ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""

I just want connection. I can't take this anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""thinking about killing myself."" This is a direct mention of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""thinking about killing myself"" indicates a current, ongoing thought process. ""I can't take this anymore"" indicates current distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does NOT mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does NOT describe any past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? YES (""thinking about killing myself"").
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation? NO (no plan/method).
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action)? NO.

Based on the rules:
-   The presence of explicit suicide thoughts (""thinking about killing myself"") rules out INDICATOR.
-   The *absence* of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out BEHAVIOR.
-   The absence of a past completed action rules out ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The user expresses a desire for their ""pointless situation to stop by crashing into another car."" The subsequent statement, ""I'm afraid that I won't die on impact,"" explicitly confirms that the intent behind crashing is to die. This is an explicit expression of wanting to end their life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates an ongoing, recurring, and potentially immediate impulse or near-action. ""I want...to stop by crashing"" indicates a current desire.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method is mentioned: ""crashing into another car."" The phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" implies a strong impulse or near-action related to this method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""frequently come close to doing it but never can"" indicates that actions are initiated or strongly considered, but not completed. This is not a past completed attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""want...to stop by crashing into another car"" with intent to die).
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes (""crashing into another car"" and ""frequently come close to doing it"").
    *   This combination points to BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The desire to ""stop by crashing"" and the fear of ""won't die on impact"" clearly make this an explicit death wish.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** ""frequently come close to doing it but never can"" fits the description of actions that were almost started or strong impulses, which falls under BEHAVIOR.
*   **Past vs. Present:** Describes current desires and frequent near-actions.
*   **When in Doubt:** It clearly has explicit thoughts and a specific method/near-action, so it's BEHAVIOR. It's not an ATTEMPT because the actions are described as ""never can"" complete.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I'm going to kill myself."" This is a direct and clear mention of suicide. ""Only a matter of when"" further emphasizes this intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm going to kill myself"" indicates a current intent for a future action. ""Only a matter of when"" suggests it's a definite future event, reinforcing urgency.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. No research for methods is indicated.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I'm going to kill myself"") but *lacks* any specific plan, method, or preparation. It does not describe a past completed attempt. According to the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I'm going to kill myself"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable; it's a direct statement of intent.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The statement is about a future intended action, not a past completed one.
*   **When in Doubt:** It clearly falls between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR. Since no method/plan is mentioned, it remains IDEATION.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""Death is an option"" and asks ""Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought?"". This directly addresses suicide/death concepts. Even though the user states ""I won't commit,"" the explicit mention of ""suicidal thought"" and ""death"" as an acceptable outcome means suicide content is present.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes a current state of thinking (""thinking death is an option""). It explicitly states ""I won't commit,"" indicating no immediate intent to act. The ""accident"" scenario is hypothetical and passive, not an active plan.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user explicitly states ""I won't commit."" The mention of ""if somehow I got an accident and die"" is a passive, hypothetical scenario (not an active plan or method to cause an accident) and explicitly states ""not suffering,"" which implies a desire for a painless, non-self-inflicted death. There is no active plan, method, or preparation described.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""Death is an option,"" ""suicidal thought"").
    *   Plan/method: No. The ""accident"" is a passive, hypothetical scenario, not an active plan. The user explicitly states they ""won't commit.""
    *   Therefore, based on the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Death is an option"" and ""suicidal thought"" are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The post discusses ""suicidal thought"" even while disclaiming intent to act, which aligns with the IDEATION rule for intrusive thoughts.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""suicidal thought"" and ""death is an option"" moves it beyond INDICATOR. The lack of an active plan or method (the accident is passive/hypothetical) means it is not BEHAVIOR.

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts/death wishes but no active plan or method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me."" This is a clear and direct mention of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Tonight is the last chance"" indicates immediate urgency and a current intention to act. ""Its been a year since i planned this"" indicates a long-term plan culminating now.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""Its been a year since i planned this"" which indicates a specific plan. Crucially, it also says ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything."" This signifies preparations and the acquisition of means, even if the specific method isn't named. Having ""stuff prepared"" is a strong indicator of a concrete plan and means.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of a past completed suicide attempt. The planning has been ongoing, but the action is described as imminent (""Tonight"").
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""kill me"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation mentioned: Yes (""planned this"", ""stuff prepared"").
    *   This combination directly points to the BEHAVIOR category. It's not an ATTEMPT because the action hasn't been completed yet (it's planned for ""Tonight""). It's more than IDEATION because there's a plan and preparations.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""kill me"" is explicit.
*   ""stuff prepared"" explicitly indicates preparation for an action.
*   The action is described as imminent (""Tonight""), not a past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.
*   The presence of a plan and preparations (""planned this"", ""stuff prepared"") moves it beyond simple IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" (""I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself""). Although it states an inability for a direct act, it immediately follows with an alternative method of self-destruction with the intent to die: ""I've decided to stop eating all together and starve myself I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends."" ""This just ends"" in this context clearly refers to ending life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I've decided to stop eating all together"" indicates a current decision and an ongoing/immediate plan.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""stop eating all together and starve myself"" is a specific method (starvation) and a clear plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past completed suicide attempts are described. The action of stopping eating is a current decision/plan, not a past completed action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""kill myself"", ""this just ends"") AND a specific plan/method (""stop eating all together and starve myself""). This aligns with the BEHAVIOR category. The initial statement about being ""too much of a pussy to kill myself"" does not negate the subsequent explicit plan for self-starvation with the intent to die.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" and ""this just ends"" (in context of self-starvation) are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** While the person says they are ""too much of a pussy to kill myself"" (implying a direct, quick method), they immediately outline an alternative, slower method of self-destruction with the clear intent to die. This is not just an intrusive thought but a stated decision and plan.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The plan to stop eating is current.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of both explicit death wishes and a specific method/plan (""starve myself"") clearly places this in BEHAVIOR, not IDEATION. It is not an ATTEMPT as it describes a current decision/plan, not a past completed action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" explicitly mentions ""wish to be gone."" According to the rules, ""want to be gone"" is an explicit mention of a death wish, even if qualified by ""don't always."" This indicates the presence of explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""for now, in this moment as I write this"" indicates current feelings of distress and loneliness. The ""wish to be gone"" is presented as something that isn't constant but is part of their internal state (""I don't always wish to be gone"" implies that sometimes they *do*).
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts. The post describes past difficult life experiences but not suicidal actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""wish to be gone""). Therefore, it is not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts (""wish to be gone"") but NO plan/method. This aligns with the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan/method, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Rule 1: ""Phrases like... 'I want to be gone' ARE explicit expressions of death wishes when in context of distress."" The post is clearly in distress, and ""wish to be gone"" is present. This confirms it's not INDICATOR.
*   Rule 5: ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention."" Since ""wish to be gone"" is an explicit death mention, IDEATION is the correct choice over INDICATOR.
*   Rule 5: ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" No method/plan is mentioned, so it remains IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm depressed constantly, **suicidal**, and lonely."" It also mentions ""delay the pain my **death** will cause."" These are direct mentions of suicide and death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language used (""constantly,"" ""delay the pain,"" ""Why push on"") indicates an ongoing state of distress and suicidal thoughts, rather than an immediate plan for ""tonight"" or ""now.""
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), no specific location, no preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), and no seeking information about methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts (""I tried,"" ""I overdosed"") or interrupted attempts.

The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late,"" ""I wont have much time to live,"" and ""Goodbye."" These are all clear expressions of suicidal intent and the expectation of death.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I just slit my wrists"" indicates an action that has *just occurred*. ""will post it once i have done it"" confirms the action was completed before posting. ""if you are seeing this then its already too late"" further emphasizes that the action is in the past and irreversible from the perspective of the post.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post details a specific method (""slit my wrists,"" using a ""dremel and put the saw atachment on"") and preparation (""looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is,"" ""marked where the my artery should be""). This goes beyond just a plan; it describes the execution of the plan.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a concrete, completed action: ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines."" This is not an interrupted action or a future plan, but a past event.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a *past completed suicide attempt*. The user states they ""just slit"" their wrists and ""took"" the dremel and ""followed the lines."" This directly aligns with the definition of ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Highly explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The language ""I just slit my wrists"" and ""I took my dremel... and followed the lines"" indicates a completed action, not an interrupted one. ""if you are seeing this then its already too late"" reinforces completion.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The emphasis is on an action that *has just occurred* (past tense), not a current thought or future plan.

These are direct expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire not to be alive by the author. (Note: The mention of the friend being suicidal is irrelevant for classifying the author's post).
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself"" indicate a current and ongoing state of suicidal ideation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors by the author.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""I'm suicidal myself"", ""I don't want to keep going myself""), so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but there is NO plan/method. This aligns with the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan/method/preparation, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.
    *   Applying the ""When in Doubt"" rule: Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit mention. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION due to no method/plan.

The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts without any specific plan or past attempt.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"". This is a direct reference to suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""If I become worse and... kill myself"" indicates a conditional future possibility, not an immediate action (""now"", ""today"") or a past event (""I tried"", ""I did"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of past attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""kill myself""). Therefore, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself""), but there is NO plan or method mentioned. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan, method, or preparation, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   It describes a potential future action, not a past completed attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""kill myself"" is an explicit expression of suicide.
*   No plan or method is specified, distinguishing it from BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, distinguishing it from ATTEMPT.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or methods.

It really took everything of me to be so vulnerable in such a dark moment, but it's gone.

It seems like an invitation by the universe to make people laugh at me for this and just push me harder. Really i dont know anymore",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I wanted to die when i made that post"". Although it also says ""i just don't want to die"", the explicit mention of having wanted to die, combined with current profound hopelessness (""meaningless torture right now"", ""no hope""), indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts. According to the rules, ""Even if the person says they don't want to act on thoughts, explicit mention of suicide/death still counts.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""wanted to die when I made that post"" refers to a past desire. However, the current state is described as ""meaningless torture right now"" and ""I have no hope,"" indicating ongoing severe distress and a struggle with suicidal ideation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research regarding suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I wanted to die"") but does not include any specific plans or methods. This aligns with the definition of IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I wanted to die"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The post states ""I wanted to die"" even if followed by ""I just don't want to die,"" which still counts as explicit mention of suicidal thoughts.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The ""wanted to die"" is a past thought, but the current feeling of hopelessness and ""meaningless torture"" suggests ongoing ideation or a strong struggle with it. The explicit mention of the past desire is sufficient for IDEATION.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION because there is explicit mention of wanting to die. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION because there is no plan/method. Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT, not applicable as no attempt is described.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

I don't know anyone who has the same interests. I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point."" It also includes ""I'm ready to say goodbye,"" which, in context, strongly implies an intention to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""at this point,"" ""am trying,"" and ""ready to say goodbye"" indicate a current and immediate state of suicidal ideation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post *does not* mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods. The phrase ""am trying to kill myself"" expresses a strong current intent but lacks the specificity of a plan or method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""am trying to kill myself"" describes a current state of intent/desire, not a past completed attempt or an initiated physical action that was interrupted. It doesn't describe *what* physical action was taken or stopped.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present. However, there is no specific plan, method, or description of an initiated physical action that would qualify it as BEHAVIOR. It is not a past completed attempt.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself"" is clearly explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The phrasing ""am trying to kill myself"" without any description of *how* or *what* action is being taken/attempted does not meet the criteria for an ""interrupted attempt where action was initiated"" as defined for BEHAVIOR (which typically implies a physical action started and stopped). It reads more as a strong statement of current suicidal intent/desire.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, the rule states ""Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" No method or specific plan is mentioned. Therefore, it remains IDEATION.

301,The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it. My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of. I could do it right now. The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die and I'm scared of the emptiness after death that all I can do is cry myself to sleep and hope that I don't wake up and do wake up at the same time. It's a neverending cycle. I'm done.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""killing myself"" and ""hope that I don't wake up,"" which are clear expressions of wanting to die/end life. ""I'm done"" in this context also points to ending life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""The only thing preventing me,"" ""I could do it right now,"" and ""The only reason I haven't"" indicate a current, immediate struggle and potential for action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of."" This indicates that means *were* considered or available at some point, and parents have *removed* them. However, the user *does not state a specific current plan, method, or preparation* they possess or are actively pursuing (e.g., ""I have pills,"" ""I'm going to the bridge,"" ""I'm writing a note""). The phrase ""I could do it right now"" refers to the *capability* or *immediacy of the urge*, not a specific *method*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted attempts. The post describes current thoughts and struggles, and what *prevents* action, not past actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""killing myself,"" ""hope that I don't wake up""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   There is NO specific plan, method, or preparation *stated by the user*. The mention of parents removing means implies a *lack* of current specific means for the user, not that the user has a specific plan.
    *   No past completed action is described.
    *   Therefore, it falls under IDEATION, as it has explicit suicidal thoughts but lacks a specific plan/method.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""killing myself"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** No interrupted actions are described.
*   **Past vs. Present:** Focus is on present thoughts and struggles, not past attempts.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose IDEATION because no specific method/plan is mentioned by the user. The post emphasizes the *lack* of means due to parental intervention and the *fear* preventing action, rather than a concrete plan.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself."" It also mentions ""no point in me being alive."" These are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts and death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself"" indicate a current and ongoing desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I'm better off dead"" is an explicit expression of wanting to be dead.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Can't stand this anymore"" indicates a current state of distress. ""I'm better off dead"" is a current feeling.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I'm better off dead"") but does not include any specific plans, methods, or preparations. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules applied:**
*   ""I'm better off dead"" is an explicit death wish.
*   There is no plan or method mentioned to elevate it to BEHAVIOR.
*   There is no description of a past completed action to classify it as ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself."" It also refers to ""set a date"" in a past context, implying a suicide date.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The current state is positive (""made the decision to live,"" ""situation is no longer as desperate""). However, the post describes *past* suicidal thoughts, plans, and preparations (""I came extraordinarily close to killing myself,"" ""my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** Yes, the post mentions ""my letters were written"" (preparation) and ""I had a set plan"" (specific plan). It also states ""I was days away from going through with,"" indicating a well-formed plan close to execution.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes coming ""extraordinarily close to killing myself"" and having ""letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with."" This indicates preparations and a very near-attempt, but not a completed action. It fits the definition of an ""interrupted attempt"" or significant preparation.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Not INDICATOR because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Not IDEATION because specific plans (""set plan"") and preparations (""letters were written"") are mentioned.
    *   It describes explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"") AND specific plans/preparations (""letters were written,"" ""set plan,"" ""days away from going through with""). This aligns with BEHAVIOR.
    *   It does *not* describe a *completed* suicide attempt. The phrasing ""came extraordinarily close"" and ""days away from going through with"" indicates it was not completed.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""killing myself"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The description of having letters written and a set plan that was ""days away from going through with"" strongly aligns with the ""Interrupted attempts where action was initiated"" or ""preparations"" part of the BEHAVIOR category, even if the physical action wasn't started. It's more than just thoughts.
*   **Past vs. Present:** While the current sentiment is positive, the post *describes* past high-risk behavior (planning, preparation). The classification is based on the highest risk described in the post, regardless of current feeling.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR due to the explicit mention of a ""set plan"" and ""letters were written."" Between BEHAVIOR and ATTEMPT, choose BEHAVIOR because the attempt was not completed (""days away from going through with,"" ""came extraordinarily close"").

Therefore, the post describes explicit suicidal thoughts with specific plans and preparations that were very close to being executed, fitting the BEHAVIOR category.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains ""wished I wasn't alive"", ""wanted things to be over"", and ""wish that I had just done it"" (referring to ending life). These are all explicit mentions of suicide/death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post primarily discusses past wishes and regret for past inaction (""not doing it years ago"", ""since about 2012"", ""first time I thought about it""). It also expresses a current feeling (""I'm angry"", ""wouldn't be here now"" as a desired outcome of past action). There is no immediate urgency for a *current* action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states ""I'm angry at myself for not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it"". This indicates that a past action *was not* taken, or is a hypothetical wish about past inaction, not a description of a completed past attempt. Therefore, there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""wished I wasn't alive"", ""wish that I had just done it"").
    *   NO plan/method is mentioned.
    *   NO past suicide attempt is described (it's regret for *not* acting).
    Based on the framework, this falls under IDEATION: ""explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" The critical rule about ATTEMPT states it ""Must involve a concrete action that occurred in the past.""

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""still wanting to die,"" ""I'm depressed and suicidal,"" ""thinking about killing myself,"" and ""get ready to die."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""still wanting to die,"" ""I'm depressed and suicidal,"" and ""there are times where i just get ready to die"" indicate current and ongoing suicidal thoughts and a state of readiness.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user states, ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a clear preparation for suicide. Additionally, ""thinking about the things i should cancel before so that my family doesn't have to"" indicates further preparations. While no specific *method* (like pills or jumping) is mentioned, concrete *preparations* are described.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes preparations and a state of readiness, but it does not describe a *completed* past suicide attempt. The note is a preparation, not an attempt. The ""getting ready to die"" is a current state of mind and readiness, not a physical action that was initiated and stopped.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   Specific preparations (writing a note, administrative considerations) are present.
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is described.

    According to the rules: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" The written note and administrative thoughts are clear preparations.
    The rule ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT"" is relevant here in spirit, as the person is ""getting ready to die"" but is interrupted by administrative thoughts, indicating a readiness for action that is stalled, coupled with concrete preparations (the note). This aligns with BEHAVIOR.

However, there is NO explicit mention of the *poster themselves* wanting to die, kill themselves, end their life, or not wanting to be alive. The references to ""removing the flaws and imperfections in the human race"" and ""purify the human race"" are about a societal/historical context, not the poster's personal desire to die.

I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I'm suicidal myself"". This is a direct and explicit mention of suicide by the person writing the post.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I'm suicidal myself"" indicates a current state. ""I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this"" also indicates current distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes the *friend's* history of attempts and issues, but there is no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, or preparations for *the poster's own* suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post details the *friend's* multiple past suicide attempts (""They have multiple suicide attempts per month""). However, the poster does *not* describe any past completed suicide attempts of *their own*.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The poster explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself,"" which means it's not `INDICATOR`.
    *   The poster expresses suicidal thoughts but does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for *their own* suicide. This rules out `BEHAVIOR`.
    *   The poster does not describe a past completed suicide attempt of *their own*. This rules out `ATTEMPT`.
    *   Therefore, the classification falls under `IDEATION` because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die/commit suicide (""I'm suicidal myself"") by the poster, but without specific plans, methods, or preparations.
    *   The critical rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned"" is crucial here. While the friend's situation is severe, the classification must be based on the poster's own statements.

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""end my own life,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""suicide"" multiple times. It discusses the utilitarian logic for suicide and the internal debate about acting on these thoughts. This clearly identifies suicide content.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned (""end my own life,"" ""killing myself,"" ""suicide""). Therefore, it is not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts, but NO plan/method/preparation mentioned. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan/method/preparation mentioned, so it is not BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself"" are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The post describes an internal conflict and a ""cry for help"" regarding the thought of killing oneself, which falls under IDEATION.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The focus is on current thoughts and a potential future decision, not past actions.
*   **When in Doubt:** It clearly falls between INDICATOR and BEHAVIOR. Since there are explicit suicide mentions but no plan, it's IDEATION.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit mentions of wanting to die: ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die.""

So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself"" and ""masturbating to the thought of killing myself."" This clearly indicates suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself"" indicates an ongoing or recent thought. ""I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself"" describes a past action related to these thoughts. The core suicidal thought is current/recent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post describes a thought process and a coping mechanism, not a concrete plan to act on suicidal thoughts.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes ""masturbating to the thought of killing myself."" This is a behavior linked to the ideation, but it is not a suicide *attempt* (an action taken with intent to die). It's a disturbing coping mechanism. No past suicide attempts (e.g., overdose, cutting with intent to die) are described.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""wanting to kill myself"").
    *   NO specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The act of masturbating is *to the thought* of suicide, not an action *of* suicide or a step in a suicide plan.
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is described.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""wanting to kill myself"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The phrasing ""kept thinking about wanting to kill myself"" aligns with ideation, even if it's a distressing thought.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The masturbation is not an interrupted attempt to die; it's a separate behavior linked to the suicidal thoughts.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The suicidal thoughts are presented as current/recent.
*   **When in Doubt:**
    *   Definitely not INDICATOR due to explicit suicide mention.
    *   Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR: No plan or method is specified. The described behavior (masturbating) is *to the thought* of suicide, not a step in a suicide plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR (which requires specific plans/methods/preparations).

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" in the context of severe distress, self-harm history, and being told to ""kill herself"" (indirectly, but contributing to the environment) is an explicit expression of questioning the value of life, which aligns with ""not wanting to be alive"" or ""want it to be over."" This meets the criteria for explicit suicidal thoughts/death wishes per Critical Rule 1.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The self-harm incident occurred ""A few months ago"" (past event). The questioning of life's worth (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"") is ongoing/general.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations for *suicide* mentioned in the post. The past action was self-harm described as an attempt ""to relieve some of the pain,"" not explicitly as an attempt to die.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a past self-harm incident (""used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain"") and general ""issues with self harm in the past."" This is self-harm, not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt (action with intent to die).
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There IS an explicit suicide/death wish (""wonder if it's even worth it anymore""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts (""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"") but NO plan/method for *suicide*. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   The past action was self-harm to relieve pain, not an attempt to die. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for ATTEMPT (requiring intent to die). It also doesn't meet BEHAVIOR, as there's no *current* plan or method for suicide.
    *   Applying Critical Rule: ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention."" This applies.

I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do?

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""act on my suicidal thoughts."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The user is ""considering going to the hospital"" *now* and is ""spiraling worse,"" indicating current distress and the presence of these thoughts in the present. They are looking for immediate solutions (""what the hell do I do?"").

They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead."" These are clear expressions of wanting to die and anticipating death. The phrase ""my family and friends would rather 'kill me'"" also reinforces the theme of death, even if referring to medication.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Soon"" and ""within 4 weeks"" (for the institutionalization) indicate a near-future timeframe for both the desired death and a significant triggering event. ""Daily"" for heroin use indicates ongoing behavior.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily."" Heroin is a specific substance, and daily use is a specific pattern of behavior. While not explicitly stated as ""I am using heroin to kill myself,"" when combined with the clear expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead""), this can be interpreted as a specific method being employed or a means to hasten death. The user is describing a concrete, dangerous action (daily heroin use) that aligns with their stated desire for death. This moves beyond mere ideation into a specific, self-destructive behavior that serves as a potential method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""I once took a anti psychotic"" which is a past experience with medication, not a suicide attempt. ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily"" is a current, ongoing behavior, not a past completed suicide attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific method/behavior (daily heroin use) is mentioned in conjunction with the desire for death. While the intent to use heroin *as the sole suicide method* isn't explicitly stated as ""I'm going to overdose,"" the combination of specific dangerous substance use and a clear desire for imminent death (""Soon I will be finally dead"") strongly suggests that the heroin use is seen as a means to achieve that desired outcome. This constitutes a specific method/plan within the context of suicidal thoughts.
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is described.

    Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a specific, ongoing, self-destructive behavior (daily heroin use) that serves as a potential method for achieving the desired death fits the definition of BEHAVIOR. The ""When in Doubt"" rule for IDEATION/BEHAVIOR states: ""Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" Heroin is a specific method, and daily use is a specific pattern of behavior.

321,"What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem. I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly asks about the ""position of the gun... for hitting the brain stem,"" which is a direct inquiry about a fatal method to end one's life. The dismissal of common deterrents (""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you"") further reinforces the suicidal intent. This clearly indicates explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The question is posed in the present tense, seeking immediate information for a potential action. It's not about a past event or a general feeling, but a specific inquiry for current planning.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Specific methods:** ""gun"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Specific target/details:** ""hitting the brain stem"" indicates a specific target for lethality.
    *   **Research/seeking:** The entire post is a direct question seeking information about the optimal way to use a specific suicide method (gun) to ensure lethality. This constitutes research and preparation.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes, by asking about a fatal gun position.
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes, a ""gun"" is a method, and asking about the ""best position for hitting the brain stem"" is specific research/preparation for that method.
    *   According to the rules, if explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation, it classifies as BEHAVIOR.

**Conclusion:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and actively seeks specific information (research) about a method (gun) and its application (""position... for hitting the brain stem""). This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR.

322,"there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head. everything just keeps getting worse, my mum saw my self harm scars and got angry at me and told me i have nothing to be upset over and i'm dramatic and stuff lol",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself."" This is a direct and explicit mention of suicidal thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself"" and ""it wont leave my head"" indicate ongoing, persistent thoughts rather than an immediate plan. ""everything just keeps getting worse"" indicates ongoing distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""my mum saw my self harm scars."" This indicates a history of self-harm, which is a significant risk factor, but it does not describe a past *suicide attempt* (an action taken with intent to die). The core suicidal statement is about *thoughts*.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts (""thought about killing myself"") are present. However, there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The self-harm scars indicate past self-harm, but the post's core suicidal content is about current/ongoing *thoughts*, not a past *suicide attempt*.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""killing myself"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** ""it wont leave my head"" aligns with intrusive thoughts, and the explicit mention of ""killing myself"" confirms IDEATION.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The self-harm scars are past, but the suicidal thoughts (""thought about killing myself,"" ""it wont leave my head"") are presented as ongoing/present.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""killing myself"" moves it past INDICATOR. The lack of a plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR. It's not an ATTEMPT because it describes ongoing thoughts and past self-harm, not a past completed suicide attempt.

Therefore, the post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method.

323,"I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash. I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it. I'm sick of life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself"" and ""Let's just do it."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Let's just do it"" indicates a current desire or immediate intent to act.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted attempts are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""killing myself,"" ""Let's just do it"") but does *not* include any specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the framework, this falls under IDEATION. The phrase ""Let's just do it"" expresses intent to act on the suicidal thoughts, but without specifying *how*, it remains within the IDEATION category, as it lacks a concrete plan/method.

**Critical Classification Rules applied:**
*   It's explicit suicide content, ruling out INDICATOR.
*   There's no specific plan/method, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
*   There's no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.
*   The presence of explicit suicide thoughts and the expression of intent (""Let's just do it"") without a method aligns perfectly with the definition of IDEATION.

324,"Just a few more hours. Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again. I'm just so tired. Not even sleep can fix this type of tired. My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better. I am not fighting anymore because I give up. I give up fighting for a body that I don't want to live in anymore. I am living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that wants to die. My body has lost the fight and my mind has won. Goodbye.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""I'm going to attempt again,"" ""I've tried to overdose three times,"" ""I want to die,"" ""a mind that wants to die,"" ""don't want to live in anymore,"" and ""my first attempt."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide content and death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again"" indicates immediate and current urgency. ""Since I've got out"" and ""at the beginning of this year"" refer to past events.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""I'm going to attempt again,"" which, combined with the history of ""tried to overdose three times,"" clearly implies a specific method (overdose) and an imminent plan.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states ""I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out"" and mentions ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year."" These are clear descriptions of past completed suicide attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide thoughts and mentions a plan/method for a future attempt (""going to attempt again,"" implying overdose based on history). This would lean towards BEHAVIOR.
    *   However, the post also *describes past completed suicide attempts* (""I've tried to overdose three times,"" ""my first attempt"").
    *   According to the ""Critical Classification Rules"" under ""When in Doubt"" for BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: ""Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions. If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""

    Given the explicit description of multiple past completed attempts, even with a current plan, the rule dictates classifying it as ATTEMPT. The presence of documented past attempts is the strongest indicator here.

My father is a pedophile,  my family on both sides wants nothing to do with me. And to top things off. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" in the context of overwhelming and unbearable life circumstances (fighting it but ""can't anymore"") is an explicit expression of wanting to cease the current state of existence, which implies a desire for life to end. This aligns with ""want to be gone"" or ""want it to be over"" as per the explicit vs. implicit rule. It's not just general distress; it's a desire for the *end* of the suffering, which is tied to the end of life in such a severe context.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore"" indicates a current breaking point. ""I just want this pain to end"" expresses a current desire.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are described.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes, ""I just want this pain to end"" is interpreted as an explicit desire for life/pain to cease, aligning with ""want to be gone"" or ""want it to be over.""
    *   Plan/method/preparation? No.
    *   Past suicide attempt (completed action)? No.

    Based on the decision logic and critical rules:
    *   The post contains explicit death wishes/desire for cessation of life (""I just want this pain to end"" in this context). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations. This rules out BEHAVIOR.
    *   There are no past completed actions. This rules out ATTEMPT.

    Therefore, it fits the definition of IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die/end life, but without specific plans/methods.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal"". It also contains phrases like ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go,"" which are clear expressions of wanting to die or end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""past this summer"" indicates a timeframe for these thoughts. ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"" suggests a current contemplation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm suicidal"", ""time for me to go""), but there is no plan or method mentioned. According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""I'm suicidal"" and ""time for me to fucking go"" are explicit.
*   ""Intrusive Thoughts"": Not applicable.
*   ""Interrupted Actions"": No actions described.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": The post describes current thoughts and feelings, not past actions.
*   ""When in Doubt"": The presence of explicit suicide mention (""I'm suicidal"") rules out INDICATOR. The absence of a plan/method rules out BEHAVIOR. The absence of a completed past action rules out ATTEMPT. Therefore, IDEATION is the correct category.

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""It's over for me,"" ""kill myself,"" ""an accident that should have never been here,"" ""I cant take it anymore,"" ""I have heard hanging is painless,"" ""I should have killed myself a long time ago,"" ""Believe me, I tried.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I'm planning on killing myself."" It also includes phrases like ""Adios i can't. It's not worth it."" and ""this life for me isn't it,"" which are clear expressions of not wanting to be alive and intent to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The timing is explicitly future-oriented (""at 30 or 25,"" ""innnn 8 yrs or so""). While the *planning* is current, the intended action is distant in the future.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""killing myself"" but provides NO specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), NO specific location, and NO preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes beyond a general ""I'm sorry to the people i know in advance"" which isn't a concrete action). The ""plan"" is about the *timing* (age 25/30), not the *method*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide wishes are present (""I'm planning on killing myself""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts, but NO specific plan/method/preparation. The ""planning"" refers to the future *intention* and *timing*, not the *means*.
    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt.

    According to the definitions:
    *   **IDEATION:** ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" This perfectly matches the post. The user expresses a clear intent to commit suicide but lacks the specific ""how.""
    *   **BEHAVIOR:** Requires ""specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods."" The post does not provide these specifics. The ""plan"" is a future date, not a method.

    Therefore, based on the lack of specific methods or preparations, despite the explicit mention of suicide and future intent, it falls under IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""suicide rate"" but this is a general statistic and an observation about others, not an explicit statement of the user's own desire to die or commit suicide. The phrase ""teetering on the edge lately"" indicates distress and being close to a breaking point, but it is not an explicit mention of wanting to die or end life. There is no direct expression of ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" or ""I don't want to be alive"" regarding the user themselves.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""lately"" indicates an ongoing state of distress. No immediate urgency.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No plan, method, location, or preparation mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** There are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned by the user for themselves. The mention of ""suicide rate"" is a general observation. ""Teetering on the edge"" indicates distress and hopelessness, but not explicit suicidal ideation. Therefore, it falls under INDICATOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours,"" which, in context, is an explicit expression of wanting to end life. The farewell ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling"" further reinforces this.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""within 24 hours"" indicates a very immediate and urgent timeframe.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) or specific location is mentioned. No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, specific setup for a method) are described. ""Gone"" refers to the outcome, not the method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts are mentioned. The post is focused on future intent.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicide"", ""gone within 24 hours""). However, there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation described.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   ""I'm gone within 24 hours"" is an explicit expression of a death wish in context.
*   There is no specific method or preparation mentioned to elevate it to BEHAVIOR. The urgency indicates strong intent, but not a concrete plan.
*   It's not an ATTEMPT as it describes future intent, not a past completed action.

Based on the definitions:
*   **INDICATOR** is ruled out due to explicit mention of suicide/death wish.
*   **BEHAVIOR** requires specific plans, methods, or preparations, which are absent.
*   **ATTEMPT** requires a past completed action, which is not present.

Therefore, it falls under **IDEATION** due to explicit expressions of wanting to die/end life, with urgency, but without a specific plan or method.

My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""it's killing me"" is used metaphorically to express extreme distress and suffering, not a literal desire to die or commit suicide. There is no explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, ""going to die"", ""want to be gone"", ""don't want to survive"", or ""want it to be over.""

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time."" This clearly identifies suicidal content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post mentions ""now after four months I'm self harming again"" and ""I'm bloodying myself up now,"" indicating current actions. The phrase ""I should do it now and save time"" indicates immediate urgency and intent to act.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes ""I'm bloodying myself up now,"" which is a current physical action of self-harm. While not explicitly stated as the *lethal* method for suicide, it is a severe self-injurious behavior occurring concurrently with explicit and urgent suicidal ideation. The framework for BEHAVIOR includes ""preparations"" and ""interrupted attempts where action was initiated."" The ongoing self-harm can be seen as a severe behavior or preparation in the context of immediate suicidal intent.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend"" and ""Now after four months I'm self harming again."" This indicates a history of self-harm and current self-harm. There is no mention of a past *suicide attempt* (an action taken with intent to die).

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself,"" ""do it now""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   The post describes current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") alongside the explicit and urgent suicidal ideation (""I should do it now""). This is more than just thoughts; it involves a current physical action.
    *   According to the Critical Classification Rules, ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" While not a specific *lethal* method explicitly named, the current self-harm is a concrete physical action happening *now* in conjunction with the immediate suicidal intent. This constitutes a behavior that goes beyond mere ideation. The self-harm is a severe action initiated by the individual, making it align with the 'BEHAVIOR' category's emphasis on actions, preparations, or initiated attempts. It's not a past completed attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the presence of current self-harm (""bloodying myself up now"") combined with explicit and urgent suicidal ideation (""I should do it now and save time"") classifies this as BEHAVIOR.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a method (""blow my head off"", ""kill me"") but frames it as a request for *someone else* to act, not a self-initiated plan or preparation by the poster (e.g., acquiring a weapon, planning a location, or researching methods for *themselves* to commit suicide). There are no details of personal preparations or active seeking of means.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts/wishes are present (""deserve death"", ""please kill me"").
    *   However, there is no *self-initiated* plan, method, or preparation described by the person writing the post. The methods mentioned are external requests.
    *   According to the rules, ""IDEATION"" is for ""explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""My only option is to cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now"". These are clear expressions of wanting to end life/commit suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""My only option is to cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now"" indicate a current consideration or desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does NOT mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods. It discusses the *idea* of ending life as a solution to problems, but not *how* it would be done.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""cut my life short"", ""ended my life""). However, there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. According to the decision logic, this falls under **IDEATION**.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Cut my life short"" and ""ended my life"" are explicit expressions of death wishes, confirming it's not just an INDICATOR.
*   No method or plan is mentioned, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, so it's not ATTEMPT.
*   The classification aligns with the IDEATION definition: ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning,"" and ""if I was gone."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes actions that happened ""in the last 4 days"" and ""Yesterday."" This points to past actions. The phrase ""I want to die"" indicates a current desire, but the most severe content is historical.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post details a specific method and quantity used: ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers."" This is a specific method, but it's described as a completed past action, not a current plan.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and provides a detailed account: ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning."" This is a clear description of a past suicide attempt, where actions were taken with intent to die.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide content (IDEATION).
    *   It describes a specific method (pills) and action taken, but this action is in the past, not a current plan (BEHAVIOR if it were current, but it's past).
    *   The key phrase is ""Yesterday I took... I honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning,"" which describes a *completed past suicide attempt*.
    *   According to the ""ATTEMPT"" definition: ""Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome. Must involve a concrete action that occurred in the past... If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""
    *   This post perfectly fits the ATTEMPT category due to the detailed description of the past overdose with intent to die.

And of course I can't consoling about it because I know some Petersonain victim blamer is going to come here and tell me to work harder; even though I am doing all the right things.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** I am looking for explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, ending life, or not wanting to be alive. The post describes a ""horrible life,"" ""life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" feeling ""bullied, harassed, treated like shit,"" and having ""no way out"" of their current situation. While these indicate severe distress and hopelessness, there is no direct or explicit statement like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" or ""I wish I was dead."" The phrase ""no way out"" refers to their life circumstances (family, culture, lack of partner), not an explicit desire to end their life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** There are no indicators of immediate or past suicidal intent or actions. The post describes ongoing feelings and past experiences of mistreatment.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is absolutely no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned.
    *   Therefore, according to the framework, it falls into the `INDICATOR` category.

6.  **Critical Classification Rules Check:**
    *   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The post expresses severe distress and hopelessness but does not contain phrases like ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I want to be gone"" as explicit expressions of death wishes. It describes a desire for their life circumstances to change, not for life itself to end.
    *   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: I would choose IDEATION if there was ANY explicit death/suicide mention. Since there isn't, it remains INDICATOR.

The post clearly expresses distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but it does not contain any explicit statements about wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life. It fits the definition of INDICATOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm feeling suicidal"", ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more"", and ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide"". This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current feelings (""I'm feeling suicidal"", ""I am scared"", ""I am not able to deal"", ""I am getting panic attacks"", ""I'm not able to sleep properly"", ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more"", ""I feel like a burden"", ""I feel the only escape""), triggered by a past event (""Yesterday I was caught"") and an immediate future event (""I am going to get to know what is the decision of the management today""). The urgency is high due to current distress and an impending decision.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide"" but does not mention any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), specific location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes thoughts and feelings, but no past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm feeling suicidal"", ""my suicidal thoughts"", ""only escape...is suicide"").
    *   NO specific plan or method is mentioned.
    *   NO past completed suicide attempt is described.
    *   Based on the rules, explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan/method classify as IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I'm feeling suicidal"", ""my suicidal thoughts"", ""only escape...is suicide"" are all explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more"" confirms explicit mention of suicide thoughts.

338,"Coward.?. I know the way I will end it. Yet the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks kn amd i jump away at the last minute. I really thought I had put all this suicide ideation behind but . i really am up against a wall and rock or however that saying goes. I have been through SO MUCH and even just one thing is so twisted and brutal that .my whole story is just too much for anyone to hear . I really don't think I have anyone except my two friends I have known for a decade . One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted.and my mom, I also have my mom. There is someone I love deeply but I am pretty sure they want nothing to do with me and honestly.all the pain I have gone through is nothing compared to the pain I feel now for knowing I fucked up something good with someone I love. No I do not want someone else or meet someone new. My heart is too tired and fragile. This person I love knows me.after them. I really do not want anyone. And I was doing better but my living situation. And all the accumulated trauma. And getting no justice at all. Amd seeing the people who fucked me up get their happily ever after and I am left wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink. I do not want to hurt the few people who love me or even the person I love .but i really do think nobody would care.and my death would make many happy probably. I just want to know how not to be a coward and jump away when I see it approaching. I really do not want to do this . But I know this is all I have left. How do I stay on the tracks? I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks. But when I see it, I panic and jump away and start crying. Help?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""I know the way I will end it,"" ""suicide ideation,"" ""wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink,"" ""my death,"" and ""How do I stay on the tracks?"" This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post discusses current distress (""I really am up against a wall""), current desires (""I am left wanting to jump""), and current contemplation of a plan (""How do I stay on the tracks?""). It also references past actions (""the times I have tried,"" ""the first time I actually attempted"").

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific plan/method is present: ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink."" Preparations are mentioned: ""I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks."" The user is also seeking advice on how to execute this plan (""How do I stay on the tracks?"").

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes past interrupted actions related to the train method (""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks kn amd i jump away at the last minute,"" ""when I see it, I panic and jump away""). Crucially, it also states, ""One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted."" This is a clear description of a past completed suicide attempt, regardless of outcome, as per the ATTEMPT definition.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific plan/method/preparation is present (train, schedule, location), which would point to BEHAVIOR.
    *   However, the post also describes a past completed suicide attempt (""the first time I actually attempted"" where 911 was called).
    *   According to the ""Critical Classification Rules,"" specifically ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions,"" and ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""

    Given the explicit mention of a past ""attempt"" where 911 was called, this overrides the current plans/interrupted actions and places the classification into ATTEMPT.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""end it all"" multiple times, ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't"" (a clear euphemism for suicide), and ""end it."" This confirms explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""I'm finally free,"" ""finally moving forward,"" ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" and ""it could finally be my time"" indicate current intent and preparation for a future action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrases ""looking into my options to end it all"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"" are strong indicators of seeking specific methods or making preparations. While no *specific* method is named, the act of ""looking into options"" and ""getting ducks in a row"" signifies active planning/research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors. The focus is entirely on current intent and future potential actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present, so not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, AND there are clear indicators of planning/preparation/research (""looking into options,"" ""getting ducks in a row""). This moves it beyond IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""Gonna end myself soon"" explicitly states an intent to commit suicide. ""to OD on"" further confirms this intent through a specific action.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""soon"" indicates a near-future intention. ""Gonna end myself"" indicates current intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on"" clearly specifies the method (overdose), the means (specific medications), and implies possession/preparation.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a future intention (""Gonna end myself soon"") and current possession of means, not a past completed action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""Gonna end myself soon"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes (""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on"").
    *   Describes past suicide attempt: No, it's a future intent.

**Conclusion based on rules:**
*   It's not INDICATOR because explicit suicide is mentioned.
*   It's not IDEATION because specific plans/methods/preparations (medications, overdose) are mentioned.
*   It fits BEHAVIOR because it has explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/methods/preparations.
*   It's not ATTEMPT because it describes a future intention, not a past completed action.

I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood"" and ""I feel like I just need to do it"" (referring to suicide, as siblings told them ""suicide is never the answer""). This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I feel like I just need to do it"" indicates current suicidal ideation. ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life"" refers to past actions, but these are relevant for assessing action history and method.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states, ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life"". This describes a specific method (knife) and a specific action (to my wrist), which constitutes a plan and preparation (acquiring means and positioning).

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut"" describes *interrupted attempts*. According to the Critical Classification Rules, ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" The user initiated the action with a specific method but did not complete it.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""seeing me dead"", ""need to do it""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   Specific plans/methods/preparations are described (""knife to my wrist 3x""). This rules out IDEATION.
    *   The actions described (""had a knife to my wrist... couldn't cut"") are *interrupted attempts*. The Critical Classification Rules explicitly state that interrupted actions are classified as BEHAVIOR.
    *   It is not ATTEMPT because the actions were not completed (""couldn't cut"").

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with specific, initiated but uncompleted actions (interrupted attempts) falls under the definition of BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""before I kill myself."" This is a clear mention of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""before I kill myself"" indicates a current state of mind where suicide is a potential future action, contingent on not feeling loved. It's a present desire/condition for a future act.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The ""fucked up stuff"" and ""everything I have done to others"" refers to general past actions, not suicide-related actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: YES (""kill myself"").
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation: NO (no plan/method).
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action): NO.
    *   Therefore, according to the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I kill myself"" is explicit.

Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide. You can't fix that shit.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Fuck life, I'm out."" which, in context of distress, indicates a desire to end life. More explicitly, it states ""Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide."" This is a direct mention of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm out"" implies immediate intent or desire. ""Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide"" indicates a current, ongoing mental state.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""the thought of suicide"" but does not describe any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes past coping mechanisms (""I've always had a solution to my issues when I was younger"") and contrasts them with the *current* presence of ""the thought of suicide."" It does not describe any past completed suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""I'm out"", ""the thought of suicide""). Therefore, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but there is NO plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is described.
    *   Based on these points, the post fits the definition of IDEATION: explicit expressions of wanting to die/commit suicide, but without specific plans, methods, or preparations. The phrase ""the thought of suicide"" directly aligns with this.

Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write. Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states: ""my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace?"" and ""It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal."" It also mentions ""For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts"" in a general sense, but the preceding text confirms the author's own experience with such thoughts. This clearly identifies suicide/death wishes or thoughts.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes a past period (""During lockdown here in Denmark, we had a long winter... At some point my thoughts came to... It made me realize... Never really thought I would act it out.""). The current tone is reflective and supportive, not urgent. However, the *content* being described is past suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations, or research about suicide methods. The author explicitly states, ""Never really thought I would act it out.""

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The author explicitly states, ""Never really thought I would act it out,"" indicating no past attempts or interrupted attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts were mentioned (""what if I wasn't in this world"", ""on the verge on becoming suicidal"").

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I think i'm gonna try to end myself again tonight"" and ""I think i'm going to try and end it tonight again."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tonight"" and ""atm"" indicate immediate and current urgency. The word ""again"" suggests a history, but the primary focus is on a planned action for ""tonight.""
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post specifies a method: ""Probably by trying to overdose."" This is a concrete plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The word ""again"" implies past attempts or a history of suicidal thoughts/actions. However, the core of the post is about a *future planned action* (""gonna try... tonight""), not a description of a completed past attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are mentioned.
    *   A specific plan/method (""overdose"") is mentioned.
    *   This points to BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""end myself"" is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable, as this is a future plan, not a past interrupted action.
*   **Past vs. Present:** While ""again"" references the past, the dominant theme is the *present intention and plan* for ""tonight.""
*   **When in Doubt:**
    *   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR because a specific method (""overdose"") is mentioned.
    *   Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: The post describes a *future planned action* (""gonna try... tonight"") with a method, not a *completed past action*. Therefore, it is BEHAVIOR. If it were solely ""I overdosed last week,"" it would be ATTEMPT. But here, it's about what they *will do* tonight.

The post describes explicit suicidal thoughts (""end myself"") and a specific method (""overdose"") planned for ""tonight."" This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" and ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all."" These are clear expressions of wanting to die/death.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""in the next month or two"" indicates a timeframe, suggesting a future event, not immediate, but definite. ""I know I'm at the end"" indicates a current state of mind.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned in the post.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.

However, there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases used are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit death wishes moves it beyond INDICATOR. The absence of a plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR. There is no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""suicide is on my mind."" It also uses phrases like ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it"" and ""I'm ready to do it,"" where ""do it"" clearly refers to suicide in context. The phrase ""I hope I can get the peace I need"" also strongly implies peace through death given the preceding suicidal ideation and plan.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post uses ""about to lock myself,"" ""It's currently 6 in the morning here... and I'm about to lock myself,"" and ""I'm ready to do it."" These indicate immediate and current intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post details a specific plan: ""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills."" This includes specific methods (knife, pills) and a specific location (bathroom). It also describes preparations (""about to lock myself"").
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly states, ""I'm so scared I've never done anything like this before,"" indicating no past attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (Step 1) AND a specific plan/method/preparation (Step 3). According to the Decision Logic, this classifies as BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""do it"" is explicit in context. ""suicide is on my mind"" is directly explicit.
*   ""Interrupted Actions"": This describes an imminent action, not an interrupted one. The person is *about to* act, not describing an action that was started and stopped. This aligns with BEHAVIOR.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": The focus is entirely on current intent and imminent action.
*   ""When in Doubt"": It clearly falls into BEHAVIOR because there are explicit thoughts AND a specific plan/method. It's not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described; in fact, the user states they've never done anything like this before.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"" and ""I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""constantly round and round"" and ""over 100 times a day"" indicate ongoing and frequent thoughts/contemplation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" indicates that the individual is actively thinking about *how* to commit suicide. While a specific method isn't named, the *act of contemplating method* falls under ""specific plans"" or ""research about suicide methods"" as defined for the BEHAVIOR category. It's a step beyond just having the thought of wanting to die; it involves thinking about the practicalities.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, ruling out INDICATOR.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts by explicitly stating the contemplation of *method*. This distinguishes it from IDEATION, which is defined as ""WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""
    *   The contemplation of method aligns with the BEHAVIOR category's criteria: ""explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods."" Contemplating method is a form of planning or research.
    *   There are no past completed actions described, ruling out ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, BEHAVIOR is the most appropriate classification.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child!

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I jsut want to die."" This is a clear expression of a death wish.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I jsut want to die"" indicates a current feeling. The context of returning to a difficult household by Jan 19th suggests ongoing and future distress, but the suicidal ideation itself is presented as a current desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** I have searched the entire post for any mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods. There is absolutely no information regarding a plan or method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes significant past trauma and ongoing distress, but it does not mention any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes, ""I jsut want to die.""
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation? No, there is no plan or method.
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action)? No.

    Based on the decision logic: If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I jsut want to die"" is explicit.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of wanting to die places it firmly in IDEATION, above INDICATOR. The absence of a plan or method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR. There are no past completed actions, so it's not ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree,"" which is a clear expression of wanting to end life. It also explicitly mentions ""suicide hotline.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving..."" indicates immediate and current thoughts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present. A specific plan/method (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") is also present. This aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" is an explicit death wish with a method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""I've struggled with suicide before."" - Explicit mention of suicide.
    *   ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" - Explicit mention of suicide (as the reason for hospitalization).
    *   ""I dont see any future ahead for me."" - Implies hopelessness.
    *   ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well."" - Explicit death wish (""joining her"" implies dying).
    *   ""I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing"" - ""my passing"" in this context strongly implies suicide.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""I've struggled with suicide before."" - Past.
    *   ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" - Past.
    *   ""I dont see any future ahead for me."" - Current/future outlook.
    *   ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well."" - Future conditional.
    *   ""I will cause with my passing"" - Future intent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific methods, locations, preparations, or research are mentioned for a *current* plan.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" This is a strong indicator of a past suicide attempt or a severe suicidal crisis that required medical intervention, which aligns with the definition of a ""completed past action"" leading to hospitalization.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and future intent (""joining her,"" ""my passing"").
    *   Crucially, it explicitly describes a past completed action related to suicide: ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" This implies a past suicide attempt or a serious action/crisis that led to hospitalization.
    *   According to the ""ATTEMPT"" definition: ""Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome. Must involve a concrete action that occurred in the past... If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" While there isn't a current *plan*, there is current *ideation* alongside the past attempt. The presence of any past attempt elevates the classification to ATTEMPT. ""Hospitalized for it"" is a concrete past event.

    Therefore, the highest classification is ATTEMPT due to the clear mention of past hospitalization for suicide.

Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit mentions of wanting to end life: ""I wake up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" ""Tired of living"" directly expresses a wish not to be alive. ""Stop it"" in this context, following intense despair and ""tired of living,"" clearly implies stopping their life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" indicates a current and urgent timeframe.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes past emotional struggles and coping mechanisms (Prozac, talking, new activities) but does not describe any past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""tired of living,"" ""stop it""). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the framework, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Tired of living"" and ""stop it"" are considered explicit expressions of death wishes in this context, moving it beyond INDICATOR.
*   No specific plan or method is detailed, so it does not escalate to BEHAVIOR.
*   No completed past attempt is described, so it is not ATTEMPT.

I used to have dreams and all that good shit and I thought this would never happen to me. But I tried making some art and I just got tired and exhausted when it ended up like shit. I used to love making shit. I used to love trying and experimenting and wasting time because it wasn't a waste to me. But capitalism and instant gratification has irreparably fucked up my brain. I don't want to anymore. It wasn't supposed to happen to me but it did. I don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have. I don't know anything anymore. I hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't. And that's life too. Is it alright to work a corporate job you're content with and live a mediocre existence? All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide and be depressed. Would've been better for me to not be here at all.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide and be depressed."" It also says, ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all,"" which is an explicit wish for non-existence/death. The repeated ""I don't want to anymore"" expresses severe distress and loss of will, which, in context with the explicit suicide mention, reinforces the presence of suicidal thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Constantly contemplate suicide"" indicates an ongoing state. ""I don't want to anymore"" and ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" describe current feelings. There are no immediate or urgent timing indicators for action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts or interrupted actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""contemplate suicide"") and a wish for non-existence (""not be here at all""). However, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Contemplate suicide"" and ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The contemplation is stated as a personal state, not just an intrusive thought being fought off. Even if it were, it's still IDEATION.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** No interrupted actions.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The contemplation is present/ongoing.
*   **When in Doubt:** It's clearly beyond INDICATOR due to explicit suicide mention. It does not contain a plan/method, so it's not BEHAVIOR. It does not describe a completed past action, so it's not ATTEMPT. Therefore, IDEATION is the correct classification.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly asks ""When to know if suicide is better."" It also refers to ""the release is better"" in the context of suicide being better, indicating a desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""When to know if suicide is better"" is a general question about timing, not an immediate statement of intent. It reflects ongoing distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""suicide is better"") but does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, it falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""suicide is better"" is explicit. ""release is better"" is contextualized by the explicit suicide mention.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post discusses current feelings and a hypothetical future consideration (""When to know if...""), not a past completed action.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""suicide"" means it's not an INDICATOR. The lack of a plan/method means it's not BEHAVIOR. The lack of a past completed action means it's not ATTEMPT. This confirms IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I wanna go sleep forever"" explicitly indicates a desire to die/end life. The context ""can't take this shit no more I'm sick and tired of my shitty life"" reinforces this as a suicidal wish.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I wanna go sleep forever"" and ""can't take this shit no more"" indicate current and immediate distress and desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly lists specific medications (""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"") and quantities. This constitutes a specific method (overdose) and preparation (having the means readily available).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or actions taken.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I wanna go sleep forever"") AND a specific plan/method/preparation (listing specific pills and quantities). This matches the criteria for BEHAVIOR. It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""I don't want to bail out anymore"" (implying not stopping suicidal actions), ""I tried with a knife"" (explicit past suicidal action), ""I have to do it"", ""I should've done it a long time ago"" (explicit intent/regret about suicide), and ""I want this to end"" (contextually, ending life).
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times"" (past), ""I tried with a knife"" (past), ""I have a rope"" (present possession/preparation), ""I have to do it"" (current urgency/resolve).
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""I tried with a knife"" (specific past method), ""I have a rope"" (specific current method acquired), ""There's a building"" (specific location considered).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times"" indicates past interrupted actions or attempts. ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" explicitly describes a past suicide attempt, where an action was taken with intent to die, regardless of the outcome.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts: Yes.
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes (rope, knife, building).
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action): Yes, ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This falls under the definition of an ATTEMPT (""actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome"").

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" refers to the immediate future. ""Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" refers to a potential future event and action, but the word ""again"" points to a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plan or method is detailed for the current wish for death or the potential future attempt.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates a past suicide attempt. The word ""again"" confirms that such an action has occurred previously.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.

    *   ""chop me up"" and ""Can someone harvest my organs?"" are specific details about the desired method and post-mortem actions, indicating a detailed plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts. The post describes a current desire and plan.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""looking for someone to kill me"") AND specific plans/methods/preparations (being killed by someone, body hidden, chopped up, organs harvested). This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

*   Intrusive Thoughts: Not applicable.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable, as it's a future plan, not an interrupted action.
*   Past vs. Present: This is a present desire and future plan, not a past attempt.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   ""fantasizing about my death"" - Explicit mention of ""death.""
    *   ""I have no desire to die. But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it."" - While stating no *desire* to die, the phrase ""some days I consider it"" directly refers to acting on the suicidal thoughts/fantasies of death. This is an explicit acknowledgment of considering suicide.
    *   Conclusion: Yes, explicit suicide/death content is present.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""now going on 10 years"", ""Every fucking day"", ""some days I consider it"" - Indicates an ongoing, general struggle, not immediate urgency.
    *   Conclusion: General/ongoing.

    *   No specific locations are mentioned.
    *   No preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.

    *   ""Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here."" - Confirms no past action was taken.
    *   Conclusion: No past attempts or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts (""suicidal thoughts"", ""fantasizing about my death"", ""some days I consider it"") are present.
    *   No plan or method is mentioned.
    *   Therefore, the classification should be IDEATION.
    *   The phrase ""I have no desire to die"" is a nuance, but it's immediately followed by ""But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it,"" which confirms the presence of ideation, even if resisted. This aligns with the ""Intrusive Thoughts"" rule: ""Even if someone says 'my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to,' this is still IDEATION because suicide is explicitly mentioned.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death"" are explicit. ""Some days I consider it"" (referring to acting on these thoughts) also makes it explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The post describes fighting these thoughts and not wanting to act on them, but still having them and *considering* them. This fits the IDEATION definition for intrusive thoughts.

    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts, but *no* specific plan, method, or preparation. The post explicitly states an *inability* to harm self. This perfectly matches the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan/method, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I just really wish to end my life"" is an explicit expression of a death wish.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" in the context of extreme distress (""lost control,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""want to scream help"") is interpreted as an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive or wanting the suffering to end, which falls under the criteria for explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language (""I just want to cry,"" ""I can't breathe,"" ""I don't want to live this again"") indicates current and immediate distress.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned.
    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, based on the decision logic, if explicit suicide thoughts are present but no plan/method, it classifies as IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I don't want to live this again"" is considered an explicit expression of a death wish in this context of severe distress.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of an explicit death wish (""I don't want to live this again"") moves it beyond INDICATOR. The absence of a plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post clearly expresses a desire not to continue living (""I don't want to live this again""), which is an explicit suicidal thought. However, it lacks any specific plans, methods, or preparations. This perfectly matches the definition of IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""my reason to die"" and ""I decided this is it"" in the context of ending life, especially with the mention of leaving a note. This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I decided this is it"" and ""I left a note"" indicate a current or very recent decision and action related to ending life.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific preparation: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" While no specific *method* (e.g., pills, jumping) is described, leaving a suicide note is a significant preparatory action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of a *completed* past suicide attempt. The action of leaving a note is a *preparation* for a future or imminent action, not a description of a past completed attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""reason to die"", ""decided this is it"").
    *   A clear preparation/action (""left a note"") is described.
    *   According to the rules: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR"".
    *   The ""left a note"" is a preparatory action, placing it beyond mere ideation. It does not describe a *completed* past attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.

Based on the analysis, the presence of explicit suicide thoughts combined with a preparatory action (leaving a note) classifies this as BEHAVIOR.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore. What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight? I just want to be normal. How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states: ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since."" and ""I just. Want. To die."" and ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"". This clearly identifies suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""I just. Want. To die."" and ""How do I kill myself..."" indicate current and immediate desire and intent. The mention of middle school indicates a long history, but the current phrasing points to present urgency.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" directly falls under ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" as described in the BEHAVIOR category. It's an inquiry about a method and a specific condition for that method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die"" and ""I was fired for being suicidal"". These describe past ideation or distress, but *not* a past completed suicide attempt (a concrete action taken with intent to die).

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""I want to die"", ""kill myself""), so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There is explicit mention of suicide thoughts AND a clear element of ""seeking information about suicide methods"" (""How do I kill myself...""). This moves it beyond simple IDEATION.
    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt.

    Based on the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts and the active seeking of information about a method (""How do I kill myself...""), the classification is BEHAVIOR. This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR: ""Posts with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods. This includes... Seeking information about suicide methods"".

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains several phrases indicating a desire to end life or not be alive: ""No point in it all,"" ""I need something to really push me over the edge"" (implying ending life), ""I feel like I wasn't meant for this world,"" ""question what the point of moving on is,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void"" (explicitly wanting to end life and face death), and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" (explicitly stating a desire for an active, non-natural end). These are explicit expressions of wanting to die or end life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language indicates a current and ongoing state of distress and a present desire for an end (""I need,"" ""I'm really starting to question,"" ""One last push is all I need"").

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned. ""One last push"" is metaphorical, not a concrete plan.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""One last push... free from it all... eternal void,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"").
    *   No specific plan or method is mentioned.
    *   Based on the framework: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" are explicit expressions of a death wish.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly falls into IDEATION as there are explicit death wishes but no plan/method. It's beyond INDICATOR due to explicit death wishes, and not BEHAVIOR or ATTEMPT due to lack of plan/action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" and ""suicide.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** There are no urgency or timing indicators related to the *poster's own* state. The post is a general observation about why people commit suicide.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned by the poster for themselves.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm behaviors are mentioned by the poster for themselves.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The most critical rule here is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned."" The post is a general commentary about suicide and the reasons people reach that point (""we've bottled everything up,"" ""painful emotions,"" ""snap and break down""). It does not express the *poster's own* suicidal thoughts, wishes, plans, or past attempts.
    *   Therefore, it does not fit `IDEATION` (no personal desire to die), `BEHAVIOR` (no personal plan/method), or `ATTEMPT` (no personal past action).
    *   The `INDICATOR` category is defined as ""Posts expressing distress, hopelessness, or general dissatisfaction with life WITHOUT any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die."" The post *does* mention the word ""suicide."" However, this mention is a general discussion of the topic, not an explicit expression of the *poster's own* desire to die or commit suicide. Given the constraint that the risk must correspond to the person writing the post, and that I must choose one of the four categories, `INDICATOR` is the most appropriate. The post discusses underlying emotional states (distress, painful emotions) that can lead to suicide, which aligns with the broader context of distress, even if it's framed generally. The ""WITHOUT explicit mention of suicide"" in the `INDICATOR` definition is interpreted here as ""without explicit mention of *the poster's own* desire to die or commit suicide."" Since the post is a general commentary and does not express personal suicidal intent, it represents the lowest level of risk classification among the given options.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""If I kill myself,"" ""leave this world forever,"" and ""I'd be dead."" This clearly indicates suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""If I kill myself"" and ""before I leave this world forever"" indicates a current contemplation or desire, although conditional, it's not a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note beyond a symbolic ""middle finger""). The ""middle finger"" is a symbolic act, not a physical preparation for the act of suicide itself.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""kill myself"", ""leave this world forever""). So, not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   Since there is no specific plan/method/preparation, it is not BEHAVIOR.
    *   It describes a potential future action/desire, not a past completed attempt. So, not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""If I kill myself"" and ""I leave this world forever"" are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   No specific plan or method is detailed.
*   No past completed action is described.

Based on the rules, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method points to IDEATION.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live"" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" These are direct expressions of not wanting to be alive and wishing for death.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tired of having to live"" indicates a current, ongoing state. ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" is a future projection of a desired outcome.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""wants to kill their self"" and ""end their pain."" This directly identifies suicide content. The phrase ""why do people stop them?"" further reinforces the focus on suicidal thoughts and potential intervention.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""If someone wants to kill their self"" and ""Asking for a personal reason"" indicates a current, ongoing thought process or desire, rather than a past event or an immediate plan with a specific timeline. It's not ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but it's not a historical account either.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research into methods. The question is general about intervention, not about *how* to do it.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

So some how she convince me not to. Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep suicide by a train is on my mind.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I been suicidal"", ""I thought jumping in and drowning"", ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", ""I'm planning on doing it"", and ""if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"". All are explicit mentions of suicide or wanting to die.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   Past: ""when I was 10 or 11 I came home... I thought jumping in and drowning... she convince me not to."" This describes a past event where suicidal thoughts and a method were present, but the action was interrupted.
    *   Current/Future: ""Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday... suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"". This indicates current suicidal ideation, a specific future plan, and current research/seeking information about a method.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Past: ""jumping in and drowning since it was pretty deep and I didn't know how to swim"" - specific method (drowning) and location (lake).
    *   Current/Future: ""suicide by a train"", ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"", ""put neck on the train tracks"" - specific method (train/train tracks), specific timing/plan, and seeking information about the method's efficacy.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning... So some how she convince me not to."" This describes an action that was initiated or very nearly initiated but was stopped/interrupted. According to Critical Classification Rule 3, ""If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT.""

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and wishes. This eliminates INDICATOR.
    *   The post contains specific plans, methods, and preparations for suicide (train, train tracks, planning date, seeking information). This eliminates IDEATION and points towards BEHAVIOR.
    *   The past event (""run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning... she convince me not to"") was an *interrupted* action, not a completed attempt. Critical Classification Rule 3 states interrupted actions are BEHAVIOR.
    *   The current plan is for the future (18th birthday) and involves seeking information about a method. This is not a past completed action.
    *   Therefore, the post clearly falls under BEHAVIOR due to the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts, specific plans/methods, preparations (planning date), research into methods, and a past interrupted action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and that the poster ""keep thinking about it"" (referring to ending life).

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations, or research for suicide are mentioned. The phrase ""it's now ok to try"" refers to a *thought* or *feeling* about the possibility, not a concrete plan or method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts through my life"" but does not describe any past suicide attempts or self-harm actions by the poster. The attempt mentioned is by ""someone who I know,"" not the poster.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""keep thinking about it,"" ""ok to try"" in context of ending life). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. There is also no description of a past completed attempt by the poster. Based on the rules: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""just want my life to end"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die/not wanting to be alive. This clearly indicates suicide content as per the definition (""not wanting to be alive"", ""want it to be over"").
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""just want my life to end"" indicates a current/ongoing desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about suicide methods.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""just want my life to end"") but no specific plan or method. According to the framework, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""just want my life to end"" is an explicit expression of a death wish.
*   ""Intrusive Thoughts"": While intrusive thoughts are mentioned, the direct statement ""just want my life to end"" is a direct expression of desire, not just a description of a thought. Even if it were purely intrusive thoughts about suicide, the rule states that explicit mention of suicide still counts as IDEATION.
*   ""When in Doubt"": The presence of an explicit death wish (""just want my life to end"") moves it from INDICATOR to IDEATION. The absence of a plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""nearly killing myself one night"" - Explicit mention of a past suicidal action.
    *   ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking."" - Explicit mention of future suicidal action (jumping/falling from height).

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""nearly killing myself one night"" - Past event.
    *   ""it'll only take one day"" - Future, potential action, implying impulsivity (""without thinking"").

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**

    *   ""over a bridge"" - Specific method (jumping/falling) and specific location.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""nearly killing myself one night"" - This describes a past action that was taken with intent to die, even if not completed. This fits the definition of a past attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   Specific plans/methods are present (""building"", ""bridge"").
    *   A past suicide attempt is described (""nearly killing myself one night"").
    *   According to the Critical Classification Rules, ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" The phrase ""nearly killing myself one night"" strongly indicates a past completed action with intent to die, regardless of outcome, fitting the ATTEMPT category. The mention of future plans (stepping off a building/bridge) reinforces the severity but the past attempt takes precedence for classification.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i want to take myself out."" This is a clear and direct expression of suicidal intent. Other phrases like ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i need a way out,"" and ""i just need it to stop"" indicate severe distress and a desire to end suffering, reinforcing the suicidal ideation.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language used (""i need help,"" ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i want to take myself out,"" ""what do i do, please?"") indicates a current and immediate state of distress and suicidal desire.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** While no specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping"") is named, the phrase ""i want to take myself out but i'm scared it'll be painful. what do i do, please?"" indicates a consideration of the *method* and a desire to find a *less painful way* to enact the suicidal intent. The question ""what do i do, please?"" in this context can be interpreted as seeking information or guidance on *how* to commit suicide without pain. This aligns with ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" as described under the BEHAVIOR category.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""i want to take myself out""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by expressing concern about the *painfulness* of ""taking myself out"" and asking ""what do i do, please?"", which implies seeking a method or information about methods. This moves it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR, as it involves contemplation of the *how* and seeking information related to execution.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""i want to take myself out"" is explicit.
*   ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR"": The concern about pain and the question ""what do i do, please?"" strongly suggest the individual is considering the *method* and seeking information/guidance on execution, which fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR (specifically ""Seeking information about suicide methods"").

I work 8 hours on the weekends and I like to sleep afterwords, just a nap right? Who doesn't like an after work nap? Well, apparently my family because as of today I am the most useless person alive. My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way. It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone, they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay. I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I have been thinking on how to die painlessly,"" ""It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone,"" and ""I want to die."" This clearly identifies suicide content and death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""for the past 6+ months I have been thinking"" indicates ongoing thoughts. ""I want to die"" indicates a current desire.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way"" indicates active seeking or research for a method. Even though a specific method hasn't been found, the act of ""thinking on how to die"" constitutes seeking information about suicide methods, which is a criterion for BEHAVIOR.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts. The ""contemplating"" mentioned earlier refers to thoughts, not actions.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to die"").
    *   There is mention of seeking a plan/method (""thinking on how to die painlessly"").
    *   According to the framework, ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" The active thought process of finding a painless way to die, even if unsuccessful so far, falls under seeking methods/preparation.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""I want to die"" and ""thinking on how to die"" are explicit.
*   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: The presence of ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" moves it beyond simple ideation into active consideration of methods, fitting the ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" criteria for BEHAVIOR.
*   Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: No past concrete action was taken, so it is not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the post fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR.

382,"Must end this shit show. I hate my parents. They have always had a job and friends. They have no idea what it is like. They just judge me and label me mentally ill.

I hate how I took the meds and just complied for months and months. I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it. I don't want to wuss out and then regret sending them.

It's motherfucking imploding and yet he still happily laughs and slurps his soup. My life is ruined. I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop. I have nothing and am on Reddit constantly. I have nothing to do and nothing I want to look at. I hate everything and everyone. I fucking hate.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop."" It also says, ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it,"" where ""do it"" strongly implies suicide in context. ""Must end this shit show"" also points to ending life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""before I do it"" indicates an intended future action. ""5 years pretty much nonstop"" indicates chronic, ongoing ideation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (pills, jumping, etc.) is mentioned. However, ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it"" describes a preparatory step. Sending emails *before* a suicidal act is a form of preparation, similar to writing a note, which is listed under BEHAVIOR.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts are described. The user states they have *thought about* killing themselves, not *attempted* it.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""killing myself""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There is explicit suicide ideation AND a preparatory step (""emails to send... before I do it""). This preparatory step (akin to writing notes/goodbyes) moves it beyond mere IDEATION.
    *   No past completed actions are described, so it's not ATTEMPT.
    *   The presence of explicit thoughts and a preparatory action (""emails to send... before I do it"") aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR (""Describing preparations (acquiring means, writing notes)"").

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I've only thought about killing myself"" is explicit.
*   The ""emails to send... before I do it"" is a clear preparatory action, which is a key component of the BEHAVIOR category.
*   No interrupted actions or past completed attempts are mentioned.

Based on the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and the description of a preparatory step (sending emails before the act), the classification is BEHAVIOR.

I ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""Ending it soon"" is a clear and explicit expression of wanting to end life. The follow-up ""I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here"" in context confirms suicidal intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Ending it soon"" and ""as soon as it gets here"" indicate immediate or very near-future intent and action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Specific method:** ""14 grams of dextromethorphan""
    *   **Preparations:** ""I ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail"" and ""I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here"" describe acquiring means and a concrete plan for execution.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts are mentioned. The focus is on a future, planned action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""Ending it soon"") AND a specific plan, method, and preparation (ordering a specific substance, intending to take it all upon arrival). This aligns directly with the definition of BEHAVIOR. It is not an ATTEMPT because the action has not yet occurred; it is a planned future action.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Ending it soon"" is explicit.
*   A specific method and preparation are detailed, moving it beyond IDEATION.
*   The action is planned for the future, not a past completed attempt.

When did Human thought it would be cool living so much?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post questions the value of living (""how people can want to live?"", ""how they actually find important to stay alive?""), and expresses aversion to the prospect of continuing life for many more years (""I have to live 60 fucking years left""). However, it does *not* contain explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""killing self,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""being dead,"" ""not wanting to be alive,"" ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" or ""want it to be over."" It expresses a profound dissatisfaction with life and a lack of desire to continue living, but not an explicit wish for death or to end life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** No immediate urgency. The post is a general reflection on the burden of life.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and general dissatisfaction with life.
    *   It does NOT contain any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die in the explicit terms defined for IDEATION. It questions the *value* of living rather than explicitly stating a *desire for death*.
    *   Comparing with IDEATION examples: ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I don't want to be alive,"" ""I wish I was dead."" The user's post does not use such direct language.
    *   Therefore, it aligns with the definition of INDICATOR: ""Posts expressing distress, hopelessness, or general dissatisfaction with life WITHOUT any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The post implies a lack of desire to live but does not use phrases like ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I want to be gone"" as explicit death wishes. It's more of a philosophical lament about the burden of life.
*   **When in Doubt (INDICATOR/IDEATION):** I choose INDICATOR because there is no *explicit* death/suicide mention. The post's language, while negative about life, does not cross the threshold into explicitly stating a desire for death or to end life.

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""passive suicidal,"" ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal,"" and ""suicide by cop.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post discusses a general scenario (""someone who's passive suicidal,"" ""they may just think"") rather than the poster's current state or past actions. It's an observation about potential reactions of others.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""Suicide by cop"" is mentioned as a potential method, but it is attributed to a hypothetical ""someone,"" not the poster themselves.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No mention of the poster's past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The core rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned"" is paramount here. While the post contains suicide-related vocabulary, the *poster* is not expressing their own suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. They are discussing a general concept or warning about how *others* might behave. Therefore, there is no direct indication of the *poster's* suicide risk. It expresses distress or concern about a situation, but not personal suicidal intent.

386,"Doctor says I might have Type 1 Diabetes, and I had a plan in mind ever since. The visit was recent, but the doctor says I might have type 1 diabetes.

Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden. My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens. Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though. Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump if my condition goes south quick and, with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go. Had a couple ideas for how to do it, but getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible. Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""had a plan in mind ever since,"" ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" (referring to suicide via insulin), ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it,"" and ""Thought about doing it a couple times."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The plan is contingent on a future event (""if it turns out I do [have diabetes]""). The statement ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" indicates a current intention/plan. Past thoughts and ideas are mentioned, but the focus is on a potential future action with a specific method.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes a specific method: ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" using a ""pump."" It identifies this as ""the way I choose to go"" and ""the easiest and most accessible."" This constitutes a specific plan and method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens."" This does not describe a suicide attempt; it sounds like an adverse medical reaction or accidental overdose, not an intentional action to end life. The phrase ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up"" explicitly states that no action was taken in the past due to logistical difficulties, reinforcing the current preference for an easier method (the pump). No completed past suicide attempt is described.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned.
    *   Specific plans/methods are described (insulin pump, 100s of units of insulin).
    *   No completed past suicide attempt is described.
    *   Therefore, the classification should be BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""the way I choose to go"" is explicit.
*   Interrupted Actions: No interrupted action is described; past thoughts didn't lead to action due to hassle. The current plan is for a future, easier method.
*   Past vs. Present: While past thoughts are mentioned, the core of the post is about a current plan and method contingent on a future event (getting the pump).
*   When in Doubt: The presence of explicit suicide thoughts AND a specific method/plan clearly places it in BEHAVIOR, not IDEATION or ATTEMPT.

The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""think that might be the way I choose to go"") and a specific plan/method (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" via a ""pump""). There is no description of a completed past suicide attempt.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday? well I do"". This clearly identifies suicidal thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" indicates immediate urgency and a present opportunity.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user states ""I have a chance right now."" This implies an opportunity or access to means, but it does *not* specify a particular method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) or location. It lacks the *specificity* required for a ""plan"" or ""method"" under the BEHAVIOR definition.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or self-harm actions are mentioned.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill yourself"", ""I do"").
    *   There is urgency (""right now"").
    *   However, there is *no specific plan, method, or preparation* described. ""A chance"" is too vague to be considered a specific method or plan.
    *   According to the rules: IDEATION is ""explicit expressions of wanting to die... WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" BEHAVIOR requires ""explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations"".
    *   Since no specific method or plan is detailed, despite the urgency and perceived opportunity, it falls under IDEATION. The ""When in Doubt"" rule for IDEATION/BEHAVIOR states: ""Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" ""A chance"" is not a method or a specific plan.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right?

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide."" It also includes phrases like ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit,"" which, in context, expresses a disregard for life and existence, akin to not wanting to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""I'm finally considering suicide"" indicates a current, ongoing thought process. ""I don't want to do this anymore"" reflects current distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does NOT mention any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does NOT describe any past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""considering suicide""). However, there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. Therefore, based on the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Considering suicide"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The consideration is current.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""considering suicide"" moves it from INDICATOR to IDEATION. The absence of any plan/method keeps it from being BEHAVIOR. There is no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

    *   The post states: ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't."" This explicitly negates the presence of a plan or the resolve to execute one.
    *   No specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, weapons) are mentioned.
    *   No specific locations (bridges, buildings, train tracks) are mentioned.
    *   No preparations (notes, acquiring means, specific setups) are mentioned.
    *   No research/seeking information about methods is mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to"" - Explicitly states *no past attempts*.
    *   No interrupted attempts are described.
    *   No self-harm behaviors are described.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""wanting to"", ""feel like killing myself"", ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would"", ""no other reason to live"", ""dying alone"").
    *   There is NO plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The post explicitly states the *absence* of attempts and the *lack of courage/guts* to act.

    Therefore, based on the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The statements are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and death wishes.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable here, as the person expresses a desire (""wanting to"", ""feel like"") rather than just intrusive thoughts they are fighting.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** No interrupted actions are described.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes current feelings and desires, with a clear statement of no past attempts and no current resolve to act.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly falls between INDICATOR and IDEATION (choosing IDEATION due to explicit mentions) and between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR (choosing IDEATION because no plan/method is present, and the post explicitly states the lack of ability/guts to act).

The post contains clear, explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires, but explicitly states the absence of a plan, method, or past attempts.

The school called and said I can be considered a truant but luckily I saw the voicemail first and deleted it. And just for anyone whose confused I can't do that class. My fat ass of a guidance councillor was too busy eating chips to check her email and pull me out of the college level class early on. What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail? I got a fifty last term and the only way to pass is to get a 80 this term. That's impossible. Plus I only have a week left. And my parents, mostly mom, are pure evil when it comes to school and mental health. Killing myself is the only escape.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape,"" and ""So goodbye everyone."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""tonight,"" ""I'm ending my life,"" and ""I'm gonna just delete everything and just slit my wrists"" indicate immediate and current intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions:
    *   ""I'll find a way"" (general intent to find a method).
    *   ""I've already written my suicide note and put it on my notes app"" (preparation).
    *   ""slit my wrists with some scissors"" (specific method).
    *   ""when everyone is going to bed"" (specific timing/circumstance).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of a past *completed* suicide attempt. The writing of the note is a preparation, not an attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned.
    *   Specific plans, methods, and preparations are mentioned.
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is described.
    *   Therefore, this falls under BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit.
*   Intrusive Thoughts: Not applicable; this is direct intent.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable; describes planned action and preparations, not an interrupted attempt.
*   Past vs. Present: Focus is on present intent and immediate future action.
*   When in Doubt: The presence of explicit suicide thoughts AND specific plans/methods/preparations clearly points to BEHAVIOR. It is not an ATTEMPT because no completed past action is described.

This post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""ending my life,"" ""killing myself"") and specific plans/preparations (""written my suicide note,"" ""slit my wrists with some scissors,"" ""tonight""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The family is ""keeping their heads up and watching me"" *now* because of the revealed plan, indicating current relevance and urgency.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly mentions ""my plan to kill myself."" While the specific details of the method or location are not provided in the post, the *existence* of a ""plan"" is stated. According to the rules, ""Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" The word ""plan"" is mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a ""plan"" that was revealed, leading to intervention. It does not describe a past *completed* suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Not INDICATOR because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Not IDEATION because a ""plan"" is explicitly mentioned, moving it beyond just thoughts/wishes.
    *   It fits BEHAVIOR because there are explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") AND a specific ""plan"" is mentioned, even if details are omitted. The family is reacting to the *plan*.
    *   Not ATTEMPT because it describes a plan that was revealed and is being prevented, not a past completed action.

**Critical Classification Rules applied:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""kill myself"" is explicit.
*   ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" The post explicitly states ""my plan,"" which qualifies as a plan being mentioned.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": The post refers to a current ""plan"" that led to present-day family intervention, not a past completed action.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""im gonna kill myself."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""3 weeks from now"" provides a specific future timing. ""Im gonna... and then im gonna kill myself"" indicates a current intention for a future act.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** While no specific *method* (like pills or jumping) is mentioned, a clear *preparation* and *timeline* are described: ""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks... and then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now."" This withdrawal and specific timeline constitute a plan/preparation leading up to the suicidal act.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts; the post describes a future planned action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""im gonna kill myself"").
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes, the withdrawal for 3 weeks and the specific timeline (""3 weeks from now"") are described as preparations and part of the plan for the suicidal act.
    *   Therefore, this fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""im gonna kill myself"" is explicit.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable, as it's a future plan.
*   Past vs. Present: Focus is on a planned future action.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""Would this kill me"" explicitly asks about death, and the context of listing multiple medications and alcohol strongly implies a suicidal intent to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""Would this kill me"" indicates a current consideration or active planning for a potential immediate action. It's not past, nor general.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post provides highly specific methods and quantities: ""Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol."" This is a detailed enumeration of means for a suicide attempt (overdose/poisoning).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts. The question is hypothetical and forward-looking, not a description of something already done.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes (""Would this kill me"" in the context of specific lethal means).
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes, very specific substances and quantities are listed, indicating a concrete plan for an overdose.
    *   This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR: ""Posts with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods."" It does not describe a *completed* past action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Would this kill me"" combined with the detailed list of substances is an explicit expression of death wishes and a concrete plan.
*   The presence of specific methods (pills, alcohol, specific quantities) moves it beyond IDEATION.
*   It is a plan being considered, not a past completed action, therefore it is BEHAVIOR, not ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""planning to end it,"" ""suicide,"" and ""thinking of doing it."" The phrase ""I'll get what I want"" in context refers to ending life.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** I have carefully read the post. There is no explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, ""going to die"", ""want to be gone"", ""don't want to survive"", or ""want it to be over"". The post expresses profound feelings of being a ""lost cause,"" a ""burden,"" and a ""failure,"" along with hopelessness about their future and past attempts to improve their situation. However, these are expressions of distress and despair about life circumstances, not a desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes an ongoing state of hopelessness and failure (""constantly stuck,"" ""always going to fail""). There are no immediate or urgent indicators related to suicidal intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific suicide plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably"" refers to attempts to fix life problems (like finding jobs), not past suicide attempts. There is no description of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, the classification should be INDICATOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The post expresses severe distress and hopelessness but *lacks* any explicit statement of wanting to die or end life. Phrases like ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I want to be gone"" are not present in the context of ending their life.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses strong feelings of sadness, loneliness, and depression (""feel like shit"", ""alone and depressed"", ""fucking sad""). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive. Phrases like ""going to die"", ""want to be gone"", ""don't want to survive"", or ""want it to be over"" are not present.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post indicates current distress (""right now"", ""I need to vent""). This suggests an immediate need for support due to current feelings, but not immediate suicidal intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, according to the decision logic, this points to INDICATOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The post expresses severe distress but does not contain any explicit or implicitly clear death wishes. It's about feeling sad and alone, seeking connection, not about wanting to die.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: There is *no* explicit death/suicide mention, so it remains INDICATOR.

The post describes severe emotional distress, loneliness, and depression, and a desire for connection, but it does not contain any explicit statements about wanting to die or commit suicide. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'INDICATOR'.

I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains several explicit mentions of wanting to end life or not wanting to continue: ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more,"" and ""lately it feels like I just can't continue."" These are explicit expressions of death wishes/not wanting to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I wrote a note today"" indicates immediate preparation. ""Lately"" and ""anymore"" indicate current and ongoing distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""I wrote a note today"" is a clear preparation for suicide, specifically mentioned in the BEHAVIOR category definition (""Describing preparations (acquiring means, writing notes)"").
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The mention of ending up in the ER and being transported to a hospital ""last night"" describes a past crisis event. However, it does *not* explicitly state that this was a suicide *attempt*. It sounds more like a consequence of reaching out for help or a mental health crisis, rather than a concrete action taken with intent to die. The post does not say ""I tried to kill myself and ended up in the ER.""
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes present (""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more,"" ""lately it feels like I just can't continue.""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   There is a specific preparation mentioned: ""I wrote a note today."" This moves it beyond IDEATION and into BEHAVIOR.
    *   The post does not describe a past completed suicide attempt (a concrete action with intent to die). The ER visit is not explicitly described as an attempt. Therefore, it is not ATTEMPT.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts *and* a specific preparation (""writing notes"") aligns perfectly with the definition of BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""Tried to end my life"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The use of ""Tried"" and ""didn't work"" indicates past actions, not current intent or future plans. The word ""again"" reinforces that this is a repeated past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No current plan or method is mentioned. The post refers to a past action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""Tried to end my life again"" clearly describes a past suicide attempt. The ""didn't work"" confirms an action was taken with suicidal intent, regardless of the outcome. This directly aligns with the definition of ""ATTEMPT"" which states ""Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome.""
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a past suicide attempt. Therefore, the classification should be ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Tried to end my life"" is explicit.
*   The phrasing ""Tried didn't work"" implies a completed action that failed, rather than an interrupted action. It was an action taken with intent to die.

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** I will scan the post for any explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, ending life, or not wanting to be alive.
    *   The post describes a long history of physical symptoms, medical treatments, and frustration with lack of improvement.
    *   The phrase ""Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much."" expresses severe distress and despair related to their unresolved health issues.
    *   However, there is *no explicit mention* of ""suicide,"" ""killing self,"" ""ending life,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""being dead,"" ""not wanting to be alive,"" ""going to die,"" ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" or ""want it to be over"" in the context of ending their life. The hopelessness is tied to their medical condition not improving.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes a chronic condition (""7 months ago now,"" ""Now I feel hopeless""). There are no urgency indicators related to suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is absolutely no mention of any suicide plans, methods, specific locations, preparations, or research about suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Based on step 1, there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned. The distress is clearly articulated, but it does not cross the threshold into explicitly stating a desire to end life.
    *   Therefore, according to the decision logic: ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned → INDICATOR"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases ""I feel hopeless"" and ""I really don't know what to do anymore"" are expressions of severe distress and frustration with their physical condition, but they are *not* explicit expressions of a death wish or suicidal intent. They do not meet the criteria for ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I want to be gone"" when those phrases imply a desire for self-inflicted death. The context here is medical frustration.

    *   ""I just deserve to be dead.""
    *   ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head.""
    *   ""I want someone to stomp me out...""
    *   ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot.""
    These phrases clearly indicate a desire for death or to be killed.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The expressions are current desires and wishes (""I deserve,"" ""I want,"" ""I wish"").

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head."" - This explicitly names a method (bullet).
    *   ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat..."" - This explicitly names a specific method (slit throat).
    Although the user states ""I have no plans,"" the presence of specific methods desired (even if passively, i.e., wishing someone else would do it) moves this beyond simple ideation. The definition of BEHAVIOR includes ""specific plans, methods..."". The mention of ""bullet"" and ""slit throat"" are specific methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts AND specific methods are mentioned (""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my throat""), even if the user states they have no *personal* plans to execute them. The presence of specific methods, even in a passive wish, aligns with the BEHAVIOR category. The critical rule ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR"" applies here because specific methods are articulated. The ""no plans"" statement is overridden by the specificity of the desired methods of death.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The mentions are explicit.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of specific methods (""bullet,"" ""slit throat"") pushes it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR, despite the ""no plans"" statement. The rule ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned"" is key.

Therefore, the presence of specific methods, even if framed as a passive wish for someone else to inflict them, classifies this as BEHAVIOR.

    *   ""I'm only alive by obligation."" - Explicitly states not wanting to be alive, but is currently alive due to external factors.
    *   ""But the second they're gone, so am I."" - This is a clear, conditional statement of intent to end life. It explicitly links the speaker's death to the parents' death.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""I will die alone."" - Future, but stated as a current conviction.
    *   ""I'm only alive by obligation."" - Current state.
    *   ""But the second they're gone, so am I."" - Conditional future intent. While not immediate, it's a clear statement of intent to end life under a specific future condition. The *desire* not to be alive is present.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide/death wishes (""I will die alone,"" ""I'm only alive by obligation,"" ""the second they're gone, so am I""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   It does NOT contain a plan or method. This rules out BEHAVIOR.
    *   It does NOT describe a past completed attempt. This rules out ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of IDEATION: ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" The conditional future intent (""the second they're gone, so am I"") still counts as an explicit expression of wanting to end life.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I will die alone"" and ""the second they're gone, so am I"" are explicit expressions of death wishes. ""I'm only alive by obligation"" is an explicit statement of not wanting to be alive.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit death/suicide mentions. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION as no plan/method is mentioned.

I'm talking to some friends now. not about them or anything, just random stuff. it's helping, but I'm just lying here wondering if I should tell them. every conversation I have with them these days, I'm just thinking ""this might be our last conversation"". during our dnd sessions, I'm thinking it could be my last. then I read this post on tumblr about the aftermath of suicide on people left behind and I started crying. and there's four friends in particular I'd be worried about and I can't help but think about them and hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling. and now it's just a guilty downward spiral but I can't do much about it right now, and I don't want to worry any of my friends by telling them how bad it is, like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad. I don't know what I want anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ones"" (urges), ""thinking of killing myself,"" and ""hate myself for thinking of killing myself."" It also references ""the aftermath of suicide.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tonight"" indicates current urges. ""been happening again for a while now"" indicates ongoing struggle. ""every conversation I have with them these days, I'm just thinking 'this might be our last conversation'"" indicates current, persistent thoughts. The phrase ""I have a plan but no date set kind of bad"" indicates a current state of having a plan.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post explicitly states, ""I have a plan but no date set kind of bad."" While no specific method or location is detailed, the *existence* of a plan is clearly stated by the individual. This is a direct match for the ""BEHAVIOR"" category criteria.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal ones,"" ""thinking of killing myself"").
    *   A plan is explicitly mentioned (""I have a plan"").
    *   According to the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""suicidal ones"" and ""I have a plan"" are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The person acknowledges having thoughts of killing themselves and a plan, even if they hate themselves for it.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The focus is on current urges, thoughts, and the present existence of a plan.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""I have a plan"" moves this definitively from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR. There is no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with the explicit statement of having a plan (""I have a plan"") classifies this as BEHAVIOR.

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" multiple times (""if I've had suicidal thoughts,"" ""lying about the suicidal thoughts,"" ""it starts to happen more and more frequently"" referring to suicidal thoughts). The phrase ""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" is a strong metaphor for feeling trapped and overwhelmed, implying a desire to escape a difficult situation, which in context with ""suicidal thoughts"" reinforces the distress and potential for wanting to end suffering.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""it starts to happen more and more frequently"" indicates an ongoing and worsening frequency of these thoughts. ""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" indicates a current state of despair.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research about suicide methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are mentioned (""suicidal thoughts"").
    *   No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   No past attempt is described.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""nearly killing myself."" This is a direct reference to suicidal action. ""I fucking hate living"" and ""rotting away"" express distress and hopelessness but are not explicit death wishes on their own.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Nearly killing myself"" refers to a past event. ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"" and ""I fucking hate living"" refer to current, ongoing feelings, but do not indicate immediate suicidal intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no current plans, methods, or preparations for suicide mentioned by the user. The ""shooting up the school"" is attributed to what the ex-friend bullied them into *nearly* doing, not a current plan of the poster.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""Nearly killing myself"" indicates a past action that was initiated with suicidal intent but was not completed. This aligns with the definition of an ""interrupted attempt"" or a failed attempt where the action was started but did not result in completion.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The presence of ""nearly killing myself"" means it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There are no *current* explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die now"") to classify it as IDEATION.
    *   The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" describes a past action that was initiated but not completed. According to the Critical Classification Rules, ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" This fits the description of ""nearly killing myself."" It implies an action was taken or almost taken with intent, but not completed.
    *   It is not ATTEMPT because ATTEMPT requires a ""past *completed* suicide attempt - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome."" ""Nearly killing myself"" implies it was *not* completed.

    Therefore, the past interrupted action (""nearly killing myself"") classifies the post as BEHAVIOR.

Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""Survived OD,"" ""kill yourself,"" and ""I wanted to"" (referring to dying from the overdose). This clearly indicates suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The primary focus is on a past event: ""Survived OD,"" ""When I sat there and swallowed 120+ pills,"" ""I held off going to the hospital."" The phrase ""Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up"" refers to processing the *past* event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes a specific method that was *executed* in the past: ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle."" This is not a future plan but a past action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post is a direct recount of a past suicide attempt: ""Survived OD."" The detailed description of swallowing pills and drinking liquor confirms a concrete action was taken with intent to die.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post describes a completed action in the past with intent to die (""Survived OD,"" ""swallowed 120+ pills... wanted to""). According to the framework, this falls under ATTEMPT. The rules state: ""ATTEMPT: Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome."" This perfectly matches the content.

The other one, now that I think of it, didn't tell me anything beyond his own experiences which weren't related to mine. Does anyone else feel the way I do? I have no issues with myself, but the world never fails to remind me how horrible it is. All words are meaningless. Every action is malicious.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""Suicide has become my quick solution."" This is a direct and clear mention of suicide as a desired outcome or solution. The phrase ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all"" also hints at a desire to escape life, which aligns with suicidal ideation, but ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" is the definitive explicit mention.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""has become"" suggests an ongoing or current state of mind where suicide is viewed as a solution. It doesn't specify immediate timing (like ""tonight"" or ""now"") but indicates a present consideration.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods. It only states suicide as a ""solution.""
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes, ""Suicide has become my quick solution.""
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation? No, there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned.
    *   Describes past suicide attempt? No.

    Based on the framework, the post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end life (""Suicide has become my quick solution"") but lacks specific plans, methods, or preparations. This aligns directly with the definition of **IDEATION**.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" is an explicit expression of a death wish/suicidal thought.
*   There are no specific plans or methods, so it doesn't escalate to BEHAVIOR.
*   There are no past completed actions, so it doesn't escalate to ATTEMPT.

It slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away. I wonder if a long-term cure even exists.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post describes severe depression and the difficulty of ""keeping on"" or ""keeping going."" It expresses feeling ""mangled (psychically)"" and wonders if a ""long-term cure even exists."" However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, killing self, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, ""going to die,"" ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" or ""want it to be over."" The phrase ""hard to keep going"" in this context refers to the struggle of living with depression, not an explicit desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes an ongoing, chronic state of depression (""Every day feels like..."", ""never really goes away""). There are no indicators of immediate intent related to suicide.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Based on the analysis, there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned. Therefore, according to the decision logic, the classification should be INDICATOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The distress is clear, but the language does not cross the threshold into explicit death wishes or wanting to be gone in the context of ending life. It focuses on the struggle of living with depression.
*   **When in Doubt:** There is no explicit death/suicide mention, so it clearly aligns with INDICATOR over IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I get suicidal thoughts"" and implicitly refers to acting on these thoughts with ""im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide content by the user. The mention of the dad's suicide provides context but the user's own thoughts are the focus for classification.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The suicidal thoughts are current and ongoing (""I can't stop thinking about it,"" ""I get suicidal thoughts"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does NOT mention any specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research about suicide methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does NOT describe any past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts by the user.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The user expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (""I get suicidal thoughts"") but provides no plan or method. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION."" The phrase ""im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" confirms the presence of the thought/desire to ""do it"" (commit suicide), even if expressing perceived inability to act, it still falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I get suicidal thoughts"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** ""I get suicidal thoughts but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it"" fits this rule; explicit mention of suicide thoughts, even with hesitation, counts as IDEATION.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The user's suicidal thoughts are present.
*   **When in Doubt:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present, so it's IDEATION, not INDICATOR. No plan/method, so it's IDEATION, not BEHAVIOR. No past completed attempt, so it's IDEATION, not ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i wanna off myself, obviously."" and ""if i killed myself"". This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language ""i wanna off myself"" indicates a current desire/state. There are no specific immediate timing indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" but the desire is present.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), specific location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about methods.

I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" - This is a *plan* for a joint suicide. While the specific method isn't stated, the *agreement* to act together under a specific condition constitutes a plan/preparation.
    *   ""I'm ending it."" - A definitive statement of intent to act.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I've been cutting my self for a long time"" - Self-harm, but described as subverting pain, not a suicide attempt.
    *   Mention of the other person's ""failed attempt to commit suicide"" is irrelevant for classifying *this user's* risk.

Just shoot yourself already"" -mom. ""You know I always invite you with my girlfriend? But you never want to come. I'm not leaving you alone; you are leaving yourself alone. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM"" -Dad. ""What? Did you try to kill yourself again? So be it, You are too coward to actually do it, anyway"" -Dad. ""Did you vomit your food again? I'm tired of this shit. You are wasting MY MONEY. You know what? I won't buy you food anymore because you vomit it anyways. That valuable money could serve other purpose and don't you dare tell your mother about this because you are the one that started this problem"" -Dad.

To be continued.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""take a gun and kill yourself"" (Mom's quote, but directed at the user) - Explicit.
    *   ""If you disappeared..."" (Mom's quote) - Implies wishing death/absence.
    *   ""Just shoot yourself already"" (Mom's quote, directed at the user) - Explicit.
    *   ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" (Dad's quote, referencing user's past action) - Explicit.
    *   ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"" (Dad's quote, referencing user's past/future action) - Explicit.
    *   ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" (Dad's quote, referencing user's past self-harm/attempt) - Explicit.
    *   All these confirm explicit suicide/death wishes and actions are highly relevant to the user.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""again"" is used multiple times, indicating past actions that are potentially ongoing or recurrent. ""Did you try..."" refers to a past event. ""Are you going to try..."" refers to a future/recurrent event. The post itself is current, reflecting the ongoing impact of these statements.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""take a gun"", ""shoot yourself"" (methods mentioned by parents, but in context of user's situation).
    *   ""cut your wrists"" (method explicitly linked to the user's past actions by the father).

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" - This is a direct reference to a past suicide attempt by the user. The word ""again"" confirms it's not a hypothetical, but a repeated action.
    *   ""Did you vomit your food again?"" - Implies an eating disorder, often co-occurring with suicidal ideation/self-harm.
    *   ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" - This implies a history of self-harm, which can be an interrupted attempt or a form of suicidal behavior. Given the ""try to kill yourself"" context, it leans towards past attempts or severe self-harm.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   Specific methods are mentioned (gun, cutting wrists).
    *   Crucially, there are clear references to *past completed actions* by the user: ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"". These phrases indicate that the user has a history of suicide attempts and self-harm. According to the definition, ""ATTEMPT: Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die..."". The parent's quotes confirm these past actions.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Highly explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** ""cut your wrists again"" could be interrupted or completed self-harm. However, ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" is a clear past attempt.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post is about the user's current distressing situation, but the quotes from parents directly reference the user's *past actions* of trying to kill themselves and cutting wrists. This directly fits the ATTEMPT category.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" is a definitive indicator of a past attempt, overriding BEHAVIOR or IDEATION.

Therefore, the classification should be ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and ""need a way to Kim's"" (likely a typo for ""kill myself"" or ""end this""). It also asks about ""least painful way to kill yourself,"" which directly relates to suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrasing ""What's the least painful way..."" and ""I just need a way"" indicates a current desire and immediate seeking of information.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user is directly asking for a ""way to kill yourself"" and ""least painful way."" This constitutes ""Research/seeking: asking about methods, looking for ways"" as per the framework. While a specific method isn't stated by the user, they are actively seeking one.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned. So, not INDICATOR.
    *   The post goes beyond just expressing a wish to die; it explicitly asks for a *method* (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""). This falls under ""seeking information about suicide methods.""
    *   According to the framework, ""Seeking information about suicide methods"" is a characteristic of BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with actively seeking information about methods classifies this as BEHAVIOR.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""suicidal note"" explicitly mentions suicide. The user is expressing an intention related to suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I think I'm going to write"" indicates a current intention or plan for the near future. ""Again"" implies this has happened before, but the current statement is about a present intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""write a suicidal note"" is a specific preparation for suicide. It falls under ""preparations"" in the BEHAVIOR definition.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** While ""again"" suggests past instances of writing notes, the post describes a *current* intention to write one, not a past completed suicide attempt. It's a preparation, not an attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide content is present (""suicidal note""), so not INDICATOR.
    *   There is a specific preparation (""write a suicidal note""), so it's more than just IDEATION.
    *   The post describes explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicidal note"") AND a specific preparation (""write a suicidal note""). This aligns with BEHAVIOR.
    *   It does not describe a past completed suicide attempt (a concrete action to die), so not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""suicidal note"" is explicit.
*   ""write a suicidal note"" is a preparation, fitting the BEHAVIOR category.
*   It's a current intent/preparation, not a past completed attempt.
*   Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, it clearly has a preparation, so it's BEHAVIOR.
*   It's not a completed past action, so not ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""slaying myself"" is an explicit mention of killing oneself.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I will end up"" suggests a future possibility, but the core statement is a current expression of suicidal thought.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations, or research is mentioned for the ""slaying myself"" part.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""slaying myself"") but does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation. This fits the definition of IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""slaying myself"" is explicit.
*   No plan or method is specified, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
*   No past completed action is described, so it's not ATTEMPT.
*   It clearly expresses a desire to die, so it's not INDICATOR.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states: ""my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" This is a direct mention of ""suicidal ideation."" Although the user also states ""I don't want to die— I want to live,"" the presence of ""suicidal ideation"" itself is the key factor. According to Critical Classification Rule 2, ""Even if someone says 'my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to,' this is still IDEATION because suicide is explicitly mentioned."" The user here acknowledges having ""suicidal ideation.""

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The ""suicidal ideation"" is presented as a current internal state (""my suicidal ideation stems from...""). The overall tone is one of ongoing struggle and distress.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is absolutely no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide. The post is about general life paralysis and self-worth issues.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal ideation"" is explicitly mentioned. So, not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method? Yes. The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" but provides no details of a plan or method.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation? No.
    *   Describes past suicide attempt (completed action)? No.

**Conclusion based on rules:**
The presence of ""suicidal ideation"" makes it fall under the IDEATION category, as there are no specific plans or methods described. Critical Classification Rule 2 reinforces this: the acknowledgment of having ""suicidal ideation"" is sufficient for IDEATION, even if the user states they don't *want* to die.

I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head."" It also mentions ""what if I don't die."" This clearly identifies suicide content and a death wish.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I wanna get..."" indicates a current desire/thought. ""I'm hesitant"" and ""I'm not risking it"" describe the current state of mind and a decision *not* to act on the plan *at this moment*.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post describes a very specific plan: ""get my dad's handgun"" (method/means) and ""shoot myself in the head"" (specific action and location). Even though the person states they are ""not risking it"" due to fear of disability, the specific plan is clearly articulated.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm actions. The post is about a current thought process and a decision *not* to act on a specific plan.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are mentioned.
    *   A specific plan/method is described (""dad's handgun"", ""shoot myself in the head"").
    *   No past completed suicide attempt is mentioned.

**Applying Critical Classification Rules:**
*   The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts (""shoot myself in the head"") and a specific method/plan (""dad's handgun"", ""shoot myself in the head"") moves this beyond IDEATION.
*   The hesitation and decision *not* to act on it *at this moment* due to a specific fear (disability) does not negate the fact that a specific plan was formulated and described. This is not an ""interrupted attempt"" as no action was initiated; it's a detailed plan being considered and then rejected for a specific reason.
*   This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR: ""Posts with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods.""

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""If my breathing doesnt go back to normal I cant see myself having a life worthliving."" These are clear expressions of not wanting to be alive or wishing for death, aligning with Critical Rule 1 (""I want to be gone"" / ""don't want to survive"").
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The expressions are current and ongoing (""anymore,"" ""can't see myself having a life"").
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific suicide methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? Yes (""my life isn't worth living anymore"").
    *   Plan/method mentioned? No.
    *   Past suicide attempt described? No.
    *   Based on the framework: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" is treated as an explicit expression of death wishes (Rule 1).
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of life not being worth living pushes it from INDICATOR to IDEATION. There is no plan/method, so it's not BEHAVIOR. There is no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon"" and ""by February I think I'll be gone"". This clearly indicates explicit suicide content and death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""soon"" and ""by February"" indicate a future intent and a timeline, though not immediate, it is a planned future action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned. The post only indicates the *intent* and a *timeline*, not the *how*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The focus is on future intent.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"", ""be gone""). However, there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. Therefore, according to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon"" and ""by February I think I'll be gone"" are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   No specific method or plan is detailed, only the intent and a rough timeline.
*   No past completed action is described.

Based on the rules, explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan/method classify as IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I just want to die"" and ""gonna end my life"". This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""this month"" indicates a specific timeframe for the intended action, suggesting a future intention. ""gonna end my life"" also indicates future action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states the intention to ""end my life this month"" but does *not* specify any particular method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) or location, nor does it describe any preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). The timing (""this month"") is present, but not a *method*.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a future intention (""gonna end my life this month""), not a past completed action or attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide wishes are mentioned (""want to die"", ""gonna end my life""). Therefore, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   There is NO specific plan/method/preparation mentioned (e.g., ""pills"", ""jump"", ""noose""). The ""this month"" adds a timeframe but isn't a method.
    *   It does not describe a past completed suicide attempt.

    Based on the definitions:
    *   **IDEATION:** ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" This matches perfectly. The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and intent (""gonna end my life"") but lacks the *specific method* required for BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughs."" This is a direct indicator of suicide content. It also mentions ""suffering"" and ""mental illnesses,"" which indicate distress.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""suicidal thoughs helped me to understood the world"" indicates that the person has or has had suicidal thoughts. While it's framed as something that helped them understand, the presence of these thoughts is clear. There's no immediate urgency indicated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") but the existence of the thoughts is present.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughs."" However, it does NOT include any specific plan, method, or preparation. According to the decision logic: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""suicidal thoughs"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The rule states that even if someone says they don't want to act on thoughts, explicit mention of suicide/death still counts as IDEATION. While the post doesn't say ""I don't want to act,"" it acknowledges the presence of these thoughts.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The mention of ""suicidal thoughs"" is sufficient for IDEATION, even if framed as a past or ongoing experience rather than an immediate intent.
*   **When in Doubt:** Since explicit ""suicidal thoughs"" are mentioned but no plan/method, IDEATION is the correct choice over INDICATOR or BEHAVIOR.

**Conclusion:** The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughs"" but lacks any specific plan or method. This fits the definition of IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"" and ""If I kill myself"". This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post mentions ""It's getting to the point where I consider checking myself into a hospital multiple times a day"" which indicates current distress. More importantly, it states ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out."" This sets a specific future timeframe and indicates an intent to plan.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, the phrase ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out"" explicitly describes an intention to *plan* and *prepare*. Setting a specific future date (""on my birthday"") for this planned action further reinforces this. This falls under the ""preparations"" aspect of the BEHAVIOR category.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide wishes are present.
    *   There is a clear indication of *planning* and *preparation* (setting a date, stating intent to plan it out), even if the method is not yet specified. This moves it beyond simple IDEATION.
    *   There is no description of a *completed past action*, so it's not ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, it fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""If I kill myself"" is explicit.
*   Intrusive Thoughts: Not applicable, it's a stated solution.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable.
*   Past vs. Present: Focus is on present thoughts and a future plan.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""attempt this weekend"" and ""my death will be following very soon too."" Phrases like ""do this once and for all"" and ""get it over with"" also strongly imply ending life in this context.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""this weekend"" and ""very soon too"" indicate immediate future timing and urgency.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** While no specific method (like pills or jumping) is mentioned, the post clearly describes a preparation: ""It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" This is a significant preparation for a planned suicide. The phrase ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" also indicates a planned action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts. The post focuses on future intent and preparation.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present. Specific preparations (writing a will) and a planned timing (""this weekend"" for an ""attempt"") are also present. This aligns with the definition of BEHAVIOR. It is not ATTEMPT because it describes a future action, not a completed past one.

*   Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit suicide content is present.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable (future intent).
*   Past vs. Present: Focus is on present intent and future plan/preparation.
*   When in Doubt: It clearly goes beyond IDEATION due to the mention of preparation (will) and a planned ""attempt"" this weekend. It is not ATTEMPT as no past completed action is described. Therefore, BEHAVIOR is the correct category.

427,"I don't want to. The final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October is coming up. But for the first time i don't wanna die, it's not like i wanna live either but i have stuff to do and I'm in the middle of making plans to move and i don't want to waste money to then die right after. But i really cannot live if i fail. The right time is gone, i have no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep. It's like for the first time in my life I'm almost happy, I'm almost enjoying doing stuff for my new room and I'll have more space to put all the projects i have in mind, I'm having millions thoughts of stuff i wanna do (probably just mania acting up), it's like i have a purpose or something. I'm in a decent place right now and i want to keep doing things. I don't know how much I'll have to wait before i finally get some antidepressants but I'm feeling better nonetheless and i don't even know how I'll do it",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains explicit mentions of suicide/death wishes, albeit with mixed feelings.
    *   ""whether or not I'll live till October"" - directly references living/dying.
    *   ""i don't wanna die"" - explicitly mentions death, indicating a past desire to die.
    *   ""i really cannot live if i fail"" - a strong conditional statement about not wanting to live.
    *   ""no place to jump from"" - mentions a specific suicide method.
    *   ""the blades i used to cut won't go that deep"" - mentions a specific self-harm/suicide method.
    *   ""I don't even know how I'll do it"" - implies a future suicidal action, even if the method is unknown.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""The final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October is coming up."" - Future conditional, specific deadline.
    *   ""for the first time i don't wanna die"" - Current sentiment, but acknowledges past desire.
    *   ""The right time is gone"" - Past opportunity for action.
    *   ""I'm in a decent place right now"" - Current positive state.
    *   The underlying conditional ""cannot live if I fail"" creates a future risk.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""no access to my meds"" - Implies pills as a potential method if accessible.
    *   ""no place to jump from"" - Explicitly mentions ""jumping"" as a method, even if currently unavailable.
    *   ""the blades i used to cut won't go that deep"" - Explicitly mentions ""blades"" and cutting as a method, even if deemed ineffective for suicide.
    *   While the user states ""I don't even know how I'll do it,"" the preceding discussion *mentions specific methods* (jumping, blades, implied meds) that have been considered, even if currently ruled out or unavailable. This constitutes ""mentioning specific methods"" as per the BEHAVIOR definition.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""the blades i used to cut"" - Indicates past self-harm behavior, but not a completed suicide attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Not INDICATOR, as there are explicit mentions of death wishes and suicide-related thoughts/methods.
    *   Not ATTEMPT, as no past completed suicide attempt is described.
    *   Between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR:
        *   IDEATION is ""explicit expressions of wanting to die... WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""
        *   BEHAVIOR is ""explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods. This includes: - Mentioning specific methods (pills, jumping, hanging, etc.).""
    *   The post *does* mention specific methods (""jump,"" ""blades,"" implied ""meds""), even if it's to state their current unavailability or inadequacy. The act of *considering and mentioning* these specific methods, even in a negative context (e.g., ""no place to jump from""), moves it beyond general ideation. The user is thinking about *how* they might do it, even if a viable plan isn't currently formed. This aligns with the BEHAVIOR category's inclusion of ""mentioning specific methods.""

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""cannot live if I fail"" is explicit.
*   **When in Doubt (IDEATION/BEHAVIOR):** Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned. Specific methods (jumping, blades, meds) are mentioned, even if unavailable or ineffective. This pushes it to BEHAVIOR.

428,"I feel as if all I've done through school and my other trials all just go to support the things I hate and that we're only seen as special if people need or want something from us. School and work have drained me the fuck out of all my motivation in the things I love. And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time.

This neverending process only helps the things I hate the most, and I don't know what to do anymore with my life.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses profound distress, exhaustion, a feeling of being trapped, and a loss of will/purpose (""don't know what to do anymore with my life""). However, it *does not* contain any explicit phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be alive,"" or similar direct expressions of wanting to end life. Phrases like ""don't know what to do anymore with my life"" indicate hopelessness but are not explicit death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes an ongoing, pervasive feeling of despair and exhaustion (""neverending process,"" ""don't know what to do anymore""). There are no immediate or time-bound indicators of suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains NO explicit suicide/death wishes.
    *   Therefore, according to the decision logic, it falls into the **INDICATOR** category.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases used, while indicative of severe distress and hopelessness, do not meet the criteria for explicit death wishes (e.g., ""I'm going to die soon,"" ""I want to be gone""). ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" is a statement of despair, not an explicit desire for death.
*   **When in Doubt:** The post clearly lacks *any* explicit death/suicide mention, confirming it is not IDEATION.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses significant distress and hopelessness but lacks the explicit suicidal ideation required for IDEATION or higher categories.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out, shoot myself with a gun,"" ""Its a net gain for the world if i die,"" ""I'm just waiting for the end,"" and ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold."" This clearly identifies suicide/death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"" indicates a future intention that is not strictly conditional. ""I'm just waiting for the end"" and ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness"" indicate a current state of readiness.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions specific methods: ""slitting my wrist and bleeding out"" and ""shoot myself with a gun."" It also describes preparations/planning for the aftermath: ""My body probably wouldn't be found for months... And if im far enough away and cut off enough, then it'll never be know that I died."" This indicates specific methods and planning.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""start cutting myself to try and ease my pain,"" which is self-harm, but framed as a future action, not a past suicide attempt. There is no mention of past completed suicide attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned: Yes.
    *   Plan/method/preparation mentioned: Yes (specific methods, planning for isolation/discovery).
    *   Describes past suicide attempt: No.
    *   Therefore, this falls under **BEHAVIOR** (explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation).

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit death wishes are present.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** ""start cutting myself"" is a planned action, not an interrupted suicide attempt. The primary suicide methods are plans.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The focus is on present feelings and future plans/readiness, not past completed attempts.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of explicit suicide thoughts and *specific methods* clearly places this in BEHAVIOR, not IDEATION. There is no past completed action to classify it as ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** I will scan the post for any explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, ending life, or not wanting to be alive.
    *   The post expresses extreme distress, paranoia (""This world is shit"", ""people around me are out to get me"", ""Am I just paranoid as fuck?"", ""I seriously don't know what's real""), feelings of being unlovable (""why am I so unlovable""), and a desire for love and truth.
    *   However, there are no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" ""I wish I was dead,"" ""I don't want to be alive,"" or similar explicit expressions of wanting to end life. The distress is high, but the explicit suicidal ideation is absent.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post uses ""right now"" indicating immediate emotional distress, but not immediate suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is absolutely no mention of any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or research related to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Based on the analysis, there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned.
    *   Therefore, according to the framework, the classification should be INDICATOR.

6.  **Critical Classification Rules Check:**
    *   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases used (""I want to cry my damn eyes out"", ""why am I so unlovable"") are expressions of severe emotional pain and distress, not explicit death wishes. The post does not contain phrases like ""I'm going to die soon"" or ""I want to be gone"" in a context indicating a desire for death.
    *   **When in Doubt:** The post clearly falls into the INDICATOR category because it expresses distress, hopelessness, and general dissatisfaction without any explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die. It does not meet the criteria for IDEATION, BEHAVIOR, or ATTEMPT.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains numerous explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that,"" ""guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning,"" ""attachment point for a noose,"" ""jump in front of their speeding car,"" ""offing myself,"" ""I want to die,"" ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide,"" ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself,"" ""ideating."" This confirms the presence of explicit suicidal ideation.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post mentions ""for years now"" and ""constant companion for years now"" for the thoughts, indicating ongoing ideation. Crucially, it states ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide"" and ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself,"" which are current and immediate indicators of the state of mind and preparedness. The planning actions (""I've contemplated and devised,"" ""I've calculated,"" ""I've tested,"" ""I've determined,"" ""I even figured out"") are described as past actions that led to the current state of having plans.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** This is a strong component of the post.
    *   ""contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation."" (General planning)
    *   ""calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning."" (Specific method: ingestion of isopropyl alcohol; specific detail: quantity calculation for a guaranteed outcome)
    *   ""tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass."" (Specific method: hanging/noose; specific preparation: testing equipment/location)
    *   ""determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house... so that I can potentially jump in front of their speeding car"" (Specific method: jumping in front of a car; specific planning: timing and location)
    *   ""I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me."" (Specific preparation: avoiding interruption/discovery)
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes extensive planning and preparation, including testing and calculating, but it explicitly states, ""But I don't do it. I don't deserve to."" There is no description of a completed past suicide attempt. The actions described are preparatory steps, not attempts at dying.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned. (Rules out INDICATOR)
    *   Specific plans, methods, and preparations are detailed. (Rules out IDEATION)
    *   There is no description of a *completed* past suicide attempt. The user states they *don't* act on the plans. (Rules out ATTEMPT)
    *   Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR, as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts coupled with detailed plans and preparations.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I wanna kill myself"" and other phrases are explicitly clear.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** The testing and calculating are preparatory actions, not interrupted attempts. The user states ""But I don't do it.""
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes current contemplation and existing plans, built on past planning actions.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of detailed plans and preparations clearly pushes it beyond IDEATION into BEHAVIOR. The lack of a completed action keeps it from being ATTEMPT.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""i shouldn't kill myself"", ""i'm not interested in being talked down at all"", ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"", and ""i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living."" This clearly identifies explicit suicidal thoughts and intentions.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates a clear and immediate timeframe for an intended action. This points to high urgency.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** While a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is not mentioned, the post refers to ""the day i chose is very soon,"" which is a specific plan regarding *timing*. It also discusses preparatory actions like ""calling my grandparents,"" ""telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother,"" which are considerations for final goodbyes, falling under ""preparations."" The combination of a chosen, imminent day and thoughts of final goodbyes constitutes ""specific plans"" and ""preparations"" as defined for the BEHAVIOR category.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" indicating long-standing ideation, but it does not describe any *past completed suicide attempts*.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide wishes are present, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   There are ""specific plans"" (chosen day ""very soon"") and ""preparations"" (considering goodbyes). This moves it beyond IDEATION.
    *   No past completed action is described, so it's not ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, it fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR (explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans/preparations).

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" is explicit. ""the day i chose is very soon"" and ""do this"" are explicit in context of distress.
*   **When in Doubt (IDEATION/BEHAVIOR):** The presence of a chosen day (""very soon"") and considering final goodbyes (""calling people?"", ""telling friends I love them"") are strong indicators of ""specific plans"" and ""preparations,"" even without a named method. This firmly places it in BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"". It also says ""I Just want to be out of my misery,"" which, in the context of being suicidal, implies a desire to end life/suffering. This meets the criteria for explicit suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" indicates a current, ongoing, and heightened state of suicidality. ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" indicates withdrawal, which can be a concerning sign of isolation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research about methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""most suicidal"", ""want to be out of my misery"").
    *   There is NO plan/method mentioned.
    *   Therefore, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""Most suicidal"" is explicit. ""Want to be out of my misery"" in this context is also considered explicit for death wishes.
*   **When in Doubt:** It's clearly beyond INDICATOR due to explicit suicide mention. It does not contain a plan/method, so it's not BEHAVIOR. It does not describe a past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT. This confirms IDEATION.

434,I just want to die. Why is it so hard to die. I just want to kill myself but I can't find a suitable way to go,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself."" These are clear expressions of suicidal ideation and death wishes. The phrase ""can't find a suitable way to go"" further reinforces the desire to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself"" indicates a current and ongoing desire. ""Why is it so hard to die"" and ""I can't find a suitable way to go"" refer to the present state of this desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""I can't find a suitable way to go."" This explicitly indicates the *absence* of a specific plan or method. While it implies a desire to find one, it does not *mention* a specific method, location, preparation, or actively *seek* information within the post itself. It's a statement of frustration about the lack of a method, not the description of a method or active research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""want to die"", ""want to kill myself"").
    *   There is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The post explicitly states the *lack* of a suitable way.
    *   According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION.""
    *   The critical rule for BEHAVIOR states ""explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods."" The post does not describe any specific plans, methods, preparations, or active research. ""Can't find a suitable way to go"" is not the same as ""seeking information about suicide methods"" as described in the BEHAVIOR definition. It's expressing the *frustration* of not having found one.
    *   When in doubt between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR, choose BEHAVIOR only if ANY method/plan is *mentioned*. Here, the *absence* of a method is mentioned. Therefore, it remains IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses being ""in the low point,"" having ""zero social skills/low self esteem/lonely,"" and asking for ""ADVICE"" on whether moving to another country is ""worth it"" for ""better living."" It indicates distress and dissatisfaction with current life circumstances. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive. Phrases like ""going to die,"" ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" or ""want it to be over"" are also absent. The question ""Is it worth it?"" pertains to the value of moving abroad, not the value of life itself.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post indicates a current ""low point"" and a desire for immediate ""ADVICE,"" but this urgency is related to seeking solutions for life problems, not immediate suicidal intent. There are no past or future timing indicators related to suicide.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, the classification should be INDICATOR. The post expresses distress, loneliness, and a desire for a better life, which aligns perfectly with the definition of INDICATOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** No explicit or implicit death wishes are present. ""Low point"" signifies distress, not suicidal ideation.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable.

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains the phrase ""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP"". This is a death wish, but it is directed *at another person* (""the guy who reported my post""), not at the person writing the post. The critical rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned."" Therefore, there is no explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive *by the poster about themselves*.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Not applicable as the death wish is not self-directed.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** Not applicable as the death wish is not self-directed.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** Not applicable as the death wish is not self-directed.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned by the poster *about themselves*, the classification should be INDICATOR. The post expresses strong negative emotion (anger, hatred) but not suicidal intent from the poster.

437,"I will kill my bullie. Hello guys, for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill  only yourself, but others. I have a problem, this women is bullying me and other people with her for couple of years now. I will kill her. I tried every possible thing to make her stop, but she is the most jealous person I have ever met in my life, so I will kill her, to finally live my life in peace. Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""suicide"" in a general statement (""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others""). However, the explicit intent expressed throughout the post is ""I will kill my bullie,"" ""I will kill her,"" and ""how to murder her."" There is no explicit mention of the *poster* wanting to kill *themselves*, end *their own* life, or wanting to die. The focus is entirely on harming another person. The critical rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I will kill her"" indicates a current intent, but it is directed outwards, not towards the self.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The user asks ""Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?"", which is seeking a plan/method, but for harming another person, not themselves.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""I tried every possible thing to make her stop"" refers to attempts to resolve the bullying situation, not past self-harm or suicide attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned by the poster for themselves, the classification falls into INDICATOR. The post expresses severe distress and intent to harm another, but it does not contain any self-directed suicidal ideation or behavior.

438,I'm on the verge of suicide. 19F I seriously cannot do this anymore. My mental health really bad and the stress of college is making. Honestly the stress might kill me before I even kill myself. I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""I just want to end it all."" These are clear mentions of suicide and wanting to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""I'm on the verge,"" ""cannot do this anymore,"" and ""I just want to end it all"" indicate a current and immediate state of distress and suicidal intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The statement ""I know exactly what to do"" strongly implies the existence of a specific plan or method, even if the details are not provided in the post. This goes beyond mere ideation and suggests a formulated course of action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A plan/method is implied (""I know exactly what to do"").
    *   No past attempt is described.
    *   According to the rules, ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR."" The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" fulfills the ""plan/method"" criterion.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit mentions are present.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes current feelings and a current known plan.
*   **When in Doubt:** The presence of ""I know exactly what to do"" pushes this from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR, as it indicates a specific plan is formed. It is not an ATTEMPT as no past completed action is described.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I just wanna die"" and ""Someone kill me dude."" Both phrases clearly express a desire for death and align with wanting to die or ending life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""I just wanna die"" and ""Someone kill me"" indicate a current and ongoing desire.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), specific location, preparations (e.g., notes), or research for methods. The phrase ""Someone kill me"" expresses a desire for an external action, but it does not constitute a self-initiated plan or method by the person writing the post.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""I just wanna die"", ""Someone kill me""). No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. Therefore, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I just wanna die"" and ""Someone kill me"" are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   No plan or method is specified.
*   No past attempt is described.

Based on the criteria, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts/wishes without a concrete plan or method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses profound distress, unhappiness, loneliness, and depression (""am tired of being unhappy lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed and always rejected""). It pleads for a ""miracle"" to ""take all thoughts away from my mind,"" ""take all gayness away all gender disphoria all depresion everything negetive out my life."" However, it *does not* contain any explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, or phrases like ""want to be gone,"" ""don't want to survive,"" or ""want it to be over"" in the context of ending life. The desire is for a change in circumstances and identity, and for suffering to cease, not for life itself to end.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post reflects ongoing distress (""always had unhappy life,"" ""am tired of""). There are no immediate timing indicators like ""tonight,"" ""today,"" or ""now"" related to suicidal action.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is absolutely no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains NO explicit suicide/death wishes.
    *   Therefore, according to the decision logic, it falls into the **INDICATOR** category. The person is expressing severe distress and hopelessness about their life situation, but not explicitly stating a desire to end their life. They are asking for a transformation or removal of their suffering.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"" in the question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"". This is a direct and explicit mention of suicide content. The context of the question, linking it to chronic, unresolving pain, suggests the user is experiencing or contemplating such thoughts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""It's been 8 months, with no change in sight"" indicates ongoing distress. The question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" implies a current state of mind where the concept of being suicidal is relevant to their pain experience.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""suicidal"") but no specific plans, methods, or preparations. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"". The critical rule ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention"" applies here as ""suicidal"" is explicit.

442,"Will somebody just love me. This year has absolutely destroyed me mentally. I don't think I can go on much longer. Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose. My substance abuse is rooted in the need to be loved. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm married and I feel alone in my own head. I wish my partner would care about me the way I do about them. I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need. The damage that caused me has been irreparable. Fuck polyamory and open relationships too. I hate now this is normalized now. Not only do I feel distant from my friends, family and everything else around me but also my lover who's supposed to guide me through this pain and make me feel right. After covid, all the other shite that's happened this year too. I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over. I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death and not feel so guilty. Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again. The only person who truly understands the pain I'm feeling",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" and ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death."" These are clear expressions of wanting to die or end life. The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" also directly links a future action to the end of life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I don't think I can go on much longer"" suggests a near-term end. ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" sets a specific condition/timeline for the desired end, indicating a planned sequence of events leading to suicide.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** While no specific method (like pills or jumping) is mentioned, the phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" acts as a *preparation* or a *specific condition/timeline* before the intended end. This falls under ""preparations: specific setups"" or ""specific plans"" as it outlines a prerequisite action before the final act. It's not just a general desire to die, but a desire linked to the completion of a specific task.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life,"" but this refers to someone else, not the user. There is no mention of past suicide attempts by the user.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts AND a specific preparation/condition (""One last record for me to make and its finally over"") that precedes the intended end. This moves it beyond mere IDEATION. The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" implies a specific, self-imposed condition or timeline for ending life, which qualifies as a form of preparation or plan.
    *   There is no description of a completed past suicide attempt by the user.

    Therefore, based on the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific preparatory action/condition linked to the desired end, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die"". This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I want to die"" indicates a current desire. ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it"" implies a future, but undefined, action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"". This explicitly indicates that there is *no specific plan or method* mentioned. It expresses a general intent for an outcome but no concrete means.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to die"").
    *   There is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"" confirms the absence of a concrete plan.
    *   Therefore, this falls under IDEATION: ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I want to die"" is an explicit expression of death wishes.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""starve myself"" with the intent to die, ""hanging myself,"" ""access to a gun"" (as preferred methods for death), ""I'll at least be dead by the end of the week,"" and ""I just want my death to come faster."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I've started to try and starve myself"" indicates an ongoing action. ""by the end of the week"" provides a specific timeframe for the desired outcome. ""I just want my death to come faster"" indicates immediate desire.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""I've started to try and starve myself"" is a specific method being initiated.
    *   ""hanging myself"" is a specific method mentioned.
    *   ""access to a gun"" is a specific method mentioned.
    *   The user is actively engaging in a method (starvation) and expressing preferences for other specific methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""I've started to try and starve myself"" describes an *ongoing* or *initiated* action, not a *completed past suicide attempt*. It's an action being taken *now* with suicidal intent.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Not INDICATOR because explicit suicide/death wishes are present.
    *   Not IDEATION because specific plans/methods (starvation, hanging, gun) are mentioned, and one (starvation) has been initiated.
    *   This fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR: ""Posts with explicit suicidal thoughts AND specific plans, methods, preparations, or research about suicide methods. This includes... Describing preparations (acquiring means, writing notes)... Interrupted attempts where action was initiated."" The starvation is an initiated action with suicidal intent.
    *   Not ATTEMPT because the post describes an *ongoing/initiated* action (""I've started to try and starve myself,"" ""if I keep starving myself I'll at least be dead by the end of the week"") rather than a *completed past suicide attempt*. The rule states ATTEMPT must involve a concrete action that *occurred in the past*. The starvation is current and future-oriented.

    *Critical Classification Rules Check:*
    *   Rule 3 (Interrupted Actions): ""I've started to try and starve myself"" is an initiated action, which falls under BEHAVIOR.
    *   Rule 5 (When in Doubt): Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT, choose BEHAVIOR because the action described (starving oneself) is ongoing/initiated, not a completed past event.

445,"Melancholy. Work sleep work sleep work sleep. I just don't want to go on anymore. It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up. I deserve a chance to show everyone exactly how bad I've been hurting, and fuck you if you think I'm selfish. I just need a chance to help myself. I need to be able to feel at least some small happiness again. How do I go on?",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""I plan my suicide every single day,"" and discusses ""escapism"" through suicide planning. It also mentions ""realistic and practical plans"" and ""the most appealing idea... is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up."" These are clear and explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I just don't want to go on anymore"" indicates a current state. ""I plan my suicide every single day"" indicates ongoing, daily planning. The discussion of ""realistic and practical plans"" and ""the most appealing idea"" refers to current, active thoughts about future actions.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post clearly outlines plans and methods: ""I plan my suicide every single day"" (general planning). Specific methods include ""using a pistol"" and ""douse myself in gasoline and light up."" A potential location is mentioned: ""way out in the desert.""

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes current planning and intentions, but it does *not* describe any past *completed* suicide attempts. Phrases like ""My life has already been over for six years now"" are metaphorical for emotional state, not a physical attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes and mentions of suicide. So, not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts AND specific plans/methods/preparations. So, it's not just IDEATION.
    *   The post describes current planning and specific methods, but not a past completed action. This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR. It does not describe an ATTEMPT because no completed action is mentioned.

6.  **Critical Classification Rules Check:**
    *   Explicit vs. Implicit: The mentions are explicitly suicidal.
    *   Intrusive Thoughts: Not applicable; the person states they *plan* it.
    *   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable; no interrupted actions are described.
    *   Past vs. Present: The focus is on current planning and future intentions, not past completed actions.
    *   When in Doubt: The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts (""I plan my suicide"") combined with specific methods (""pistol,"" ""gasoline and light up"") clearly places it in the BEHAVIOR category. It's not ATTEMPT as no past completed action is stated.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidale all my life,"" ""I would wanna go to the angels,"" ""I can't go on like this,"" ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it,"" and ""I just can't pull myself together and just do it."" All these clearly indicate suicidal thoughts and wishes to die.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   **Current/Immediate:** ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" ""Today I failed because..."" ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it."" This indicates a current, active suicidal process, specifically an interrupted action.
    *   **Past Events:** ""When I was four..."", ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists."", ""When I was 19 I laid on a road..."", ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train."" These describe multiple past events and attempts.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   **Current:** ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" This describes a specific method (hanging) and preparation (chair, rope), indicating an initiated but interrupted action.
    *   **Implied Current Plan:** ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it.""

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly details multiple past suicide attempts:
    *   ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists."" (Action: cutting wrists)
    *   ""When I was 19 I laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over."" (Action: lying on road)
    *   ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train."" (Action: jumping in front of a train)
    *   The phrase ""But everytime I try I fail"" further confirms a history of attempts.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide content, moving it beyond INDICATOR.
    *   It contains specific plans/methods and an interrupted action (""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck""), which would typically classify it as BEHAVIOR according to Rule 3 (""Interrupted Actions... this is BEHAVIOR"").
    *   However, the post also clearly describes *multiple past completed suicide attempts* (""tried to cut my wrists,"" ""laid on a road,"" ""jumped in front of a train"").
    *   The definition for ATTEMPT states: ""Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome. Must involve a concrete action that occurred in the past... If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""
    *   Given that the post explicitly describes past completed attempts, even with a current interrupted action, the critical rule ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT"" takes precedence.

**Final Classification based on rules:** The presence of clear descriptions of past completed suicide attempts (""tried to cut my wrists"", ""laid on a road"", ""jumped in front of a train"") alongside current suicidal ideation and an interrupted action leads to the ATTEMPT classification.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"" - Directly questions suicidal behavior.
    *   ""if I die then I die"" - Explicit mention of death/dying and acceptance.
    *   ""willing to accept when my time has come"" - Explicit acceptance of death.
    *   ""Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier."" - Explicit mention of dying.
    *   ""I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be."" - Expresses a desire not to prolong life, aligning with not wanting to be alive.
    *   ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it"" - Explicitly mentions ""end it"" (life), even while denying plans.
    *   *Conclusion:* Yes, there is explicit mention of death, dying, and not wanting to prolong life.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""As of right now"" - Current state.
    *   ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's"" - Past action with ongoing implication.
    *   ""if I die then I die"" / ""willing to accept when my time has come"" - General, ongoing acceptance of a potential future event.
    *   *Conclusion:* Describes a current state of mind and a past action supporting that mindset.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it"" - Explicitly states no plans.
    *   ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's"" - This is an act of omission/self-neglect, which could indirectly lead to death, but it is not a direct, active *method* of suicide (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging, weapons) or a *preparation* (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) as defined in the BEHAVIOR category. The framework emphasizes active means.
    *   *Conclusion:* No specific active plan, method, or preparation for *committing* suicide is mentioned.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's"" - This is a past action. However, it is not a past *attempt* (e.g., overdose, hanging attempt) or *self-harm behavior* (e.g., cutting, taking pills with intent to harm but not necessarily die) as defined by the framework's examples. It's a passive act of self-neglect rather than an active, direct suicide attempt.
    *   *Conclusion:* No past active suicide attempts or direct self-harm behaviors are described.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit death wishes (""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come"", ""not worth pushing my life further""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I don't have any plans to end it."" While stopping doctor visits is mentioned, it's a passive act of omission, not an active *method* or *preparation* for suicide as defined in the BEHAVIOR category (which lists active means like pills, jumping, acquiring means). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a completed past suicide attempt. This rules out ATTEMPT.
    *   The criteria for IDEATION are ""explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" This perfectly matches the post: explicit death wishes are present, but active plans/methods are explicitly denied or are passive acts of omission.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""if I die then I die"" is explicit.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit death wishes. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION because there is no *active* plan/method/preparation described, and the post explicitly denies plans. Stopping doctor visits is passive self-neglect, not an active suicide method.

I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, too depressed to have actual friends, to ugly to have a significant other, and too lazy and my thyroid is too fucked up to make losing weight an option unless I starve myself or something",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself."" Even though the user states they are ""too much of a coward to kill myself,"" the phrase itself introduces explicit suicide content. This aligns with Rule #2 (Intrusive Thoughts), where explicit mention of suicide, even with a disclaimer, still counts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The statement ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" indicates a current thought process. There are no immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight"" or ""now"" for action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plan or method for *suicide* is mentioned. The phrase ""unless I starve myself or something"" is presented in the context of weight loss, not as a specific suicide method or plan. While starvation can be lethal, its primary context here is body image/weight, not a direct suicide plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts or interrupted actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide wishes are mentioned (""kill myself""). Therefore, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but there is NO specific plan or method for suicide. This fits the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no specific plan/method/preparation for suicide mentioned, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The phrase ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" falls under this rule. The thought of suicide is present and explicitly stated, even if the user expresses an inability to act. This confirms it's IDEATION.
*   **When in Doubt:** Between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION because ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned. Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION because no specific plan or method for suicide is described.

A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it.

Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""thinking about suicide"" but explicitly states it's about ""a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide."" The author is providing advice on how to help *others*, not expressing their own suicidal thoughts or wishes. The critical rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned"" is key here. Therefore, for the *author*, there is NO explicit mention of suicide, killing self, wanting to die, etc.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Not applicable to the author's own state. The post is general advice.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** Not applicable to the author's own state. No plan or method is mentioned for the author.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** Not applicable to the author's own state. No past attempts or self-harm behaviors are mentioned for the author.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Based on the analysis, the author of the post is not expressing any explicit suicide/death wishes for themselves. The mention of suicide is entirely in the context of helping someone else. Therefore, according to the decision logic, ""If NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned"" *for the author* -> INDICATOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people mentioned."" - This rule is paramount. The post is about helping a *friend* who is struggling with suicidal thoughts, not the author themselves.
*   The author is not expressing distress or hopelessness for themselves, nor are they expressing any desire to end their own life.

Therefore, the post falls under the 'INDICATOR' category as it does not contain any explicit suicidal expressions from the author.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""no reason to live"" - Explicitly states lack of reason to continue living.
    *   ""it just seems like the end to me."" - Implies end of life.
    *   ""I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that."" - Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and acceptance of it.
    *   ""will only drive me further to killing myself."" - Explicitly mentions ""killing myself.""
    *   ""I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die."" - Explicitly mentions ""time to die.""
    *   Conclusion: Yes, there are multiple explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, and not wanting to be alive.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""Now I'm a waste of life..."" - Current state.
    *   ""it just seems like the end to me."" - Current feeling.
    *   ""I feel like I am finally becoming content with that."" - Current acceptance of suicide.
    *   ""I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end."" - Immediate and critical loss of a coping mechanism, indicating heightened current risk.
    *   Conclusion: Strong indicators of current distress and a sense of immediate crisis due to loss of medication.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   The post mentions ""stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily."" While these are self-destructive behaviors and risk factors, they are not described as a *specific suicide method or plan* (e.g., ""I will overdose on X pills,"" ""I will jump from Y location"").
    *   The mention of ""I took my last Ativan today"" describes the cessation of a coping mechanism, not a plan to use Ativan for suicide.
    *   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging, weapons) are outlined as a means to commit suicide.
    *   No specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods are mentioned.
    *   Conclusion: No specific plan, method, or preparation is described.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily"" are current self-harm behaviors/coping mechanisms, not past suicide attempts.
    *   No description of past completed suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to overdose,"" ""I cut myself with intent to die,"" ""I put a noose around my neck"").
    *   Conclusion: No past suicide attempts are mentioned.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""killing myself,"" ""time to die,"" ""suicide is their life's purpose""). This rules out INDICATOR.
    *   The post does *not* contain specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. This rules out BEHAVIOR.
    *   The post does *not* describe a past completed suicide attempt. This rules out ATTEMPT.
    *   Therefore, the classification falls under IDEATION, as it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and wishes without a specific plan or method. The mention of stopping medication and drinking heavily are risk factors and self-destructive behaviors, but not a *suicide plan* as defined. The critical rule ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned"" confirms IDEATION since no method/plan is mentioned.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""drowning yourself,"" ""guaranteed death,"" ""transition to death,"" and ""I think its the best option for me."" This clearly indicates suicide and death content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post asks a question about the method (""Is drowning yourself painful?"") and states a conditional future intent (""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that.""). While conditional, it expresses current contemplation and a potential future action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method, ""drowning yourself,"" is identified. A general location, ""bottom of the ocean,"" is also mentioned. The user is actively considering and researching this method (""Is drowning yourself painful?"").
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm actions. The post is about future contemplation and potential action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific plan/method (""drowning yourself,"" ""ocean"") is mentioned, along with research into it.
    *   It is not a past completed attempt.
    *   Therefore, it fits the criteria for BEHAVIOR (explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation/research).

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""drowning yourself"" is explicit.
*   Intrusive Thoughts: Not applicable.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable.
*   Past vs. Present: Focus is on current contemplation and potential future action.
*   When in Doubt: This clearly falls under BEHAVIOR because a specific method is mentioned and being contemplated/researched.

I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate?

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes:
    *   ""Is life actually worth living anymore?"" (Implies questioning life's value)
    *   ""I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life..."" (Expresses severe distress and reluctance to continue)
    *   ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"" (Explicit mention of suicide)
    *   ""I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this."" (Refusal to continue living in current state)
    *   ""I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out."" (Explicit expression of not wanting to be alive and wanting to end it)
    *   ""I don't see what there is to live for."" (Explicitly states lack of reason to live)
    *   ""Surely, I can just call it quits now?"" (Explicit expression of wanting to end life)
    *   ""Death seems a better option to me than living in this world."" (Explicit expression of preferring death)
    *   ""I think it's time for me to accept defeat."" (Implies giving up on life)

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The language indicates current and immediate thoughts/feelings: ""anymore?"", ""now?"", ""I don't know if I can take it anymore"", ""I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this"", ""I don't want to live"", ""I want out"", ""I don't see what there is to live for"", ""call it quits now?"", ""Death seems a better option to me"", ""I think it's time for me to accept defeat."" All point to present state.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post expresses strong suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, but it does **not** mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes current feelings and thoughts. There is **no** mention of any past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There are explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, so it's not INDICATOR.
    *   There are explicit suicide thoughts (""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"", ""I don't want to live... and I want out"", ""Death seems a better option"") AND NO plan/method. This perfectly matches the definition of IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan/method/preparation, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The phrases identified in Step 1 are explicitly about wanting to die or end life.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mentions of suicide/death wishes clearly place it beyond INDICATOR. The absence of a plan/method means it is not BEHAVIOR. The absence of a past completed action means it is not ATTEMPT.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire for death without detailing any specific plan or method.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts."" Even though the context is about *not* acting on these thoughts *now*, the terms themselves are direct references to suicide.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""hopefully postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so"" indicates that suicide attempts are an ongoing consideration or a potential future action that needs to be delayed. It implies an existing predisposition or thought.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plan, method, location, preparations, or research about suicide methods are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post talks about ""postponing any suicide attempts,"" which implies a potential for future attempts or a history of ideation, but it does *not* describe a completed past suicide attempt. It's about delaying *future* potential actions, not recounting a *past completed* action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""kill myself"", ""suicide attempts""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, but there is NO plan/method. This aligns with IDEATION.
    *   There is no plan/method/preparation, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no description of a completed past suicide attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"" are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The post is similar to ""my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to"" in that the concept of suicide is explicitly present, even if the person is currently choosing not to act on it. The very act of needing a reason *not* to kill oneself, and to ""postpone"" suicide attempts, confirms the presence of suicidal ideation.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"" pushes it from INDICATOR to IDEATION. There are no methods/plans, so it stays at IDEATION, not BEHAVIOR. There is no completed past action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the post clearly falls under IDEATION because it explicitly discusses suicide, even if it's about *delaying* or *not* acting on it, and lacks specific plans or a description of a completed past attempt.

459,Happy people makes me suicidal. Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts because I know I will always be a loser who will never make friends. It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" and ""kill myself."" This confirms the presence of suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The thoughts are described as recurring (""Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts""). There is no immediate urgency or specific timing for an action. The phrase ""I will probably never kill myself"" indicates a lack of immediate intent to act.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations, or research are mentioned. In fact, the post states a reason *not* to act (""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person"").
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself""). However, there is no plan, method, or preparation described. The post even states a reason *not* to act on these thoughts. According to the rules, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION."" The critical rule ""Even if someone says 'my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to,' this is still IDEATION because suicide is explicitly mentioned"" directly applies here.

**Final Classification based on rules:**
*   Explicit mention of suicide/death wishes: Yes (""suicidal"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""kill myself""). This rules out INDICATOR.
*   Specific plans, methods, preparations, or research: No. This rules out BEHAVIOR.
*   Past completed suicide attempts: No. This rules out ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

460,"A great way to end an awful year. I had so many friends before now. I had lived my entire life a lonely bastard at school but this quarantine i finally got some online friends and guess what? Fucked it up. I sent my (ex) boyfriend creepy messages because i'm a fucking idiot and of course no one wanted to be friends with me anymore. I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic. No one from my real life, no classmates or family, none of them. just some random woman who lives on an entire different continent. I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve. I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" and ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" This clearly identifies suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""on new year's eve"" indicates a specific future time. ""this is the one"" (referring to the suicide note) implies a current decision or finalization of preparation.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** While no specific method like pills or jumping is mentioned, the phrase ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"" describes a clear *preparation* (writing suicide notes). The definition of BEHAVIOR includes ""Describing preparations (acquiring means, writing notes)"".

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The mention of ""made 3 other suicide notes"" refers to past *preparations*, not past *attempts*. The post does not describe a concrete action taken with intent to die that occurred in the past.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide wishes are present, so not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present, AND preparations (suicide notes) are mentioned. This moves it beyond IDEATION.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts (""ending it all"") AND preparations (""made 3 other suicide notes... this is the one"") fits the definition of **BEHAVIOR**.
    *   There is no description of a *completed past suicide attempt*, only past *preparations* (making notes). Therefore, it is not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""ending it all"" is explicit.
*   The mention of ""suicide notes"" is a direct preparation, classifying it as BEHAVIOR over IDEATION.
*   No completed past action, so not ATTEMPT.

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""tried to cut myself."" While this is self-harm, it does not explicitly state ""suicide,"" ""killing self,"" ""wanting to die,"" ""being dead,"" or ""not wanting to be alive."" The intent stated is ""wanted to feel something real,"" not explicitly to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""last night"" indicates a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** ""cut myself"" is a specific method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""I tried to cut myself last night"" explicitly describes a past self-harm behavior. The framework notes ""Self-harm behaviors: cutting, taking pills, etc."" under Action History.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   It's not INDICATOR because a concrete *action* (self-harm) was taken, not just expressions of distress or hopelessness.
    *   It's not IDEATION because there are no explicit expressions of wanting to die or commit suicide.
    *   It's not ATTEMPT because the post does not describe an action taken with *intent to die*. The stated intent was ""to feel something real.""
    *   This leaves BEHAVIOR. The definition for BEHAVIOR includes ""Interrupted attempts where action was initiated."" The phrase ""tried to cut myself"" describes an action that was initiated. The critical rule ""Interrupted Actions: If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT"" supports classifying initiated self-harm actions as BEHAVIOR, even if the explicit suicidal intent is not stated, as it signifies a severe behavioral manifestation of distress.

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   The post describes a past action (""tried to cut myself"").
*   The action is a specific method (""cut myself"").
*   While explicit suicidal intent is not stated, the action of self-harm, especially as an initiated action (""tried to cut myself""), aligns with the ""Interrupted attempts where action was initiated"" clause under the BEHAVIOR category. This clause is presented as an inclusion for BEHAVIOR, implying that such actions qualify, even if the primary BEHAVIOR definition requires ""explicit suicidal thoughts."" Given the severity of the action and its inclusion in ""Action History"" and the ""Interrupted Actions"" rule, BEHAVIOR is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""plan to kill myself"" and ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""plan to kill myself"" indicates a current intention.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post states ""plan to kill myself"" but does *not* mention any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), specific location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). While the word ""plan"" is used, the *details* of the plan are absent. The question ""Why shouldn't i?"" implies a moment of hesitation or seeking external reasons not to act, rather than detailing an immediate, specific action.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present. However, there are no *specific* plans, methods, or preparations detailed in the post. The phrase ""I plan to kill myself"" is a strong expression of intent, but without the ""how"" (specific method, location, or preparation), it does not meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR. It aligns with the IDEATION definition: ""explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations."" The example ""I want to kill myself (without method)"" is very similar to ""I plan to kill myself"" without a method.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit.
*   **Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR:** The rule states ""Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned."" While ""plan"" is mentioned, the definition of BEHAVIOR requires *specific* plans, methods, or preparations. The post lacks this specificity. Therefore, it remains within IDEATION.

Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""killing yourself"" multiple times (""you'll be killing yourself soon"", ""I have no worries of being stopped"", ""however it goes down""). This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""killing yourself soon"" indicates a near-future intention.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does *not* mention any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). It's a general statement of intent regarding the act itself, not how it will be carried out.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. The discussion is about a future action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""killing yourself"").
    *   However, there is NO specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    *   It does not describe a past completed suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, according to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION (explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method).

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""killing yourself"" is an explicit expression of death wishes.
*   No interrupted actions or past attempts are described.
*   The post focuses on a future, intended action.
*   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Since there are explicit suicide thoughts but no method/plan, it's IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'll kill myself tonight"" and ""I want to kill myself so bad."" It also mentions ""hang myself."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""tonight"" indicates immediate intent and urgency. ""I'll play... and hang myself"" describes a current plan for the near future.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method (""hang myself"") and a specific location (""at the woods"") are mentioned. A preparation (""play my favorite music ever"") is also described. This indicates a clear plan and method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a *future* planned action (""I'll kill myself tonight,"" ""hang myself""), not a past completed attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific plan/method/preparation is present.
    *   No past completed attempt is described.
    *   Therefore, this falls under **BEHAVIOR**.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""kill myself"" is explicit.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes present intent and a future plan, not a past completed action.
*   **Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR:** A method (""hang myself"") and location (""at the woods"") are mentioned, pushing it beyond IDEATION into BEHAVIOR.
*   **Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT:** It's a planned future action, not a completed past action, so it's BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I want to kill myself."" This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrase ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching"" indicates a specific, current, and approaching timeline for suicidal action.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching"" constitutes a specific plan (a timeline/date).
    *   ""Already started to cancel friendships"" is a preparatory action, often associated with preparing for suicide (isolating oneself).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of a past completed suicide attempt (e.g., ""I tried to overdose,"" ""I jumped""). The actions described are current preparations for a future act.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I want to kill myself"").
    *   Specific plans/preparations are present (""set a date,"" ""started to cancel friendships"").
    *   This combination points to the **BEHAVIOR** category. It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described. It is not IDEATION because there are specific plans/preparations beyond just thoughts.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I want to kill myself"" is explicit. Setting a date and cancelling friendships are explicit preparations.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes current intent and ongoing preparations (""I'm approaching,"" ""Already started"").

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" (""i have to so i dont kill myself"") and ""suicide"" (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look""). This clearly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" and ""Is suicide really as bad..."" indicate current, ongoing thoughts and contemplation.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post does not mention any specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research about *how* to commit suicide. It asks if suicide is bad, not how to do it.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes a current coping mechanism (""i have to so i dont kill myself"") to prevent an action, not a past completed attempt or an interrupted attempt. There is no mention of ""I tried,"" ""I overdosed,"" or similar phrases.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   No plan or method is mentioned.
    *   No past completed attempt is described.
    *   According to the framework, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" are explicit expressions of death wishes.
*   Even though the person is trying to *avoid* acting on it, the explicit mention of ""kill myself"" and questioning ""Is suicide really as bad..."" makes it IDEATION. This aligns with the rule: ""Even if someone says 'my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to,' this is still IDEATION because suicide is explicitly mentioned.""
*   No interrupted actions or past attempts are described.
*   The post focuses on present thoughts and coping.
*   When in doubt between INDICATOR/IDEATION, choose IDEATION due to explicit mention. When in doubt between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR, choose IDEATION as no method/plan is mentioned.

Therefore, the post fits the definition of IDEATION.

Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""decide to throw myself off a bridge,"" ""ive been suicidal since i was 9,"" ""i fifnt want to be here,"" ""my last vent,"" ""this is just a way of dying,"" and ""last few seconds i can ever memorize."" All these phrases indicate explicit suicide or death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** Phrases like ""possibly my last vent before i littitimatly decide,"" ""now i am at peace, no longer in pain,"" ""locked in the bathroom,"" and ""might as well be my last"" strongly indicate current and immediate intent. ""Last few seconds i can ever memorize"" suggests extreme urgency.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post clearly states ""throw myself off a bridge,"" which is a specific method (jumping) and a specific location (bridge). It also explicitly says, ""Ive planned it all out."" This confirms a specific plan and method.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The user mentions ""ive been suicidal since i was 9"" and ""i self-harmed."" These are past ideation and self-harm behaviors. However, the core of the post describes a *current decision* and *future planned action* (""decide to throw myself off a bridge,"" ""Ive planned it all out""), not a completed past suicide attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.
    *   Specific plan/method/preparation is present (""throw myself off a bridge,"" ""Ive planned it all out"").
    *   The post describes a *future* planned action, not a *completed past action*.

**Critical Classification Rules Applied:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The language is highly explicit regarding suicide intent and method.
*   **Past vs. Present:** While past ideation and self-harm are mentioned, the primary focus and urgency are on the *present decision* and *imminent future action* with a specific plan.
*   **Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR:** It's BEHAVIOR because a specific method (""throw myself off a bridge"") and a clear statement of having a plan (""Ive planned it all out"") are present.
*   **Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT:** It's BEHAVIOR, not ATTEMPT, because the post describes a *plan* and *intent* for a *future* action (""decide to throw myself off a bridge"") rather than a *completed past action* (e.g., ""I jumped off a bridge""). The user is describing preparations and intent for an action that is about to happen or is being decided upon, not an action that has already occurred.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm gonna commit suicide"" and ""die of blood loss."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The repeated phrase ""I'm gonna"" indicates immediate or near-future intent and urgency.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific (though unusual) method: ""twist my dick off"" and the intended outcome ""die of blood loss."" This constitutes a specific plan/method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or completed actions. The language is entirely prospective (""I'm gonna"").
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm gonna commit suicide""). A specific plan/method (""twist my dick off,"" ""die of blood loss"") is also present. This combination leads to BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: The statements are explicit.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable as it's future intent, not a past initiated action.
*   Past vs. Present: The focus is on present intent to act in the future.
*   When in Doubt: It's clearly beyond IDEATION due to the specific method. It's not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   ""Sayonara."" - Implies a final goodbye, often associated with ending something.
    *   ""I will eventually die in a much painful way."" - Explicit mention of dying, framed as an inevitable and painful outcome.
    *   ""I have no reason to live"" - Explicit expression of not wanting to be alive.
    *   *Conclusion:* Yes, explicit mentions of death and not wanting to live are present.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:**
    *   ""Sayonara."" - Suggests a current decision or state of mind.
    *   ""I will eventually die"" - Future, but presented as an inevitable and painful fate that the person is resigned to or anticipating.
    *   ""I am lonely and have no reason to live"" - Current state.
    *   *Conclusion:* The post conveys a current state of hopelessness and a perceived inevitable, painful end, with a strong sense of finality implied by ""Sayonara"" and ""no reason to live.""

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging) are mentioned.
    *   No specific locations are mentioned.

    *   No interrupted attempts are mentioned.
    *   No self-harm behaviors are mentioned.
    *   *Conclusion:* No action history is present.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Is there NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned? No, there are explicit death wishes (""I will eventually die"", ""no reason to live""). So, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Are there explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method? Yes. The post explicitly states a desire to not live (""no reason to live"") and a resignation to dying (""I will eventually die""), but without any specific plan or method.
    *   Are there explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation? No, there is no plan/method.
    *   Does it describe a past suicide attempt (completed action)? No.

    Based on the decision logic, the presence of explicit expressions of not wanting to live and anticipation of death, without a specific plan or method, classifies it as IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I will eventually die"" and ""I have no reason to live"" are explicit expressions of death wishes/not wanting to be alive.
*   No plan or method is described.
*   No past completed action is described.
*   Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION due to explicit death/not wanting to live statements.
*   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose IDEATION due to lack of specific plan/method.
*   The risk corresponds to the person writing the post.

473,"I'm 14 and the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother. For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school. I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times."" It also implies a fragile hold on life with ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" and ""he is the only reason im alive right now."" This is clear explicit mention of suicide/death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The suicidal thoughts (""I thought of killing myself multiple times"") are described as past occurrences (in 2019), but the post also states ""it has been getting much worse"" and ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore,"" indicating a current, worsening state of distress that could lead to a recurrence of these thoughts or actions. The phrase ""he is the only reason im alive right now"" also points to a current, precarious state.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There are no specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There are no past attempts (completed actions) or interrupted attempts described. The thoughts were present, but no action was taken.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are mentioned (""I thought of killing myself multiple times""), and the current distress implies ongoing risk, but there is NO plan/method/preparation. This aligns with the definition of IDEATION. The critical rule ""Even if the person says they don't want to act on thoughts, explicit mention of suicide/death still counts"" applies here, as the past thoughts are explicitly stated, and the current context suggests continued vulnerability.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" is explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The past thoughts are explicitly mentioned, fitting the IDEATION criteria.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** While the explicit thoughts are mentioned as past, the current severe distress (""it has been getting much worse,"" ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"") and the statement ""he is the only reason im alive right now"" indicate a present state where suicidal ideation is a significant concern, even if not explicitly re-stated in the present tense. The past explicit mention of suicide is sufficient for IDEATION, especially when combined with current distress.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of ""killing myself"" pushes it past INDICATOR. The lack of any plan/method keeps it from BEHAVIOR. No completed action means it's not ATTEMPT.

Therefore, the classification is IDEATION.

474,"Where can I find out how to die. I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I just want to definitely die"" and ""how to die"". This clearly indicates explicit suicide content and a wish to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""Where can I find out how to die"" and ""I just want to definitely die"" indicate a current and immediate desire and active seeking of information.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The phrase ""Where can I find out how to die"" directly falls under ""Research/seeking: asking about methods, looking for ways"" as defined in the BEHAVIOR category. This is not just a thought, but an active step towards finding a method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.
    *   There is a clear indication of seeking information about methods, which counts as ""plan/method/preparation"" (specifically, ""seeking information about suicide methods"").
    *   It is not a description of a past completed attempt.
    *   Therefore, based on the rules, explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation leads to BEHAVIOR. The critical rule ""Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR if ANY method/plan mentioned"" applies here, as seeking information about methods is a form of plan/preparation.

475,"It Never Quite Goes Away. I stick around for other people, but not because I want to be alive. It's not just that I don't see a future for myself, I just don't really want one either. It does get better, and then it gets worse, and then it gets better, and then worse, etc. I'm tired of buying time from myself over and over again. I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty. Maybe it's that 'indifference toward other people' that they were talking about when I got diagnosed with PTSD (still reeling from that one, it never seemed bad enough to me.

I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""not because I want to be alive,"" ""the same familiar will to die,"" and ""if I do attempt again."" These are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts and past action.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post states ""I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out."" This indicates a future, non-immediate timeframe for potential action. The phrase ""if I do attempt again"" refers to a past event.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time,"" but this refers to life plans to delay, not suicide plans. It states ""if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail,"" implying future intent and confidence, but no specific method or preparation for *that future action* is detailed.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""if I do attempt again"" is a direct and explicit reference to a past suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   There is explicit suicide content (""will to die,"" ""not want to be alive"").
    *   There is no specific *current* plan or method described for a *future* action, but there is a clear statement of intent for a future action (""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"").
    *   Crucially, there is a clear mention of a *past suicide attempt* (""if I do attempt again"").

**Critical Classification Rules Application:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** Explicit mentions of death wishes and past attempts.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post discusses both current ideation/future intent and a past attempt.
*   **When in Doubt:** The rule ""Between BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT: Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions"" is directly applicable. The phrase ""if I do attempt again"" confirms a completed past action. Even though there's future intent and ideation, the presence of a past attempt pushes it to ATTEMPT.

476,"My temptations will soon get the better of me. Every day the pain gets worse. For the past week, I haven't thought about anything other than how and when I'm going to take my life. It's peaceful to think about, to imagine myself free from everything. I can't see myself going on to live a normal life, or much of a life at all. I've fucked my education up, I've fucked my relationships with other people up, I've fucked up everything in my life. I simply won't live a comfortable life in the slightest, it'll only continue to get worse as it always has. At the stage I'm at, I don't even want to live a comfortable life anymore, I don't want any more chances. I just want the pain to stop. I'm only 16 and I've gone through enough of it to last multiple lifetimes. I'm too afraid to use any method aside from a gun to the head, though. Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days until I'm able to. But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there. Where the fuck did everything go so wrong?",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I haven't thought about anything other than how and when I'm going to take my life."" It also mentions ""I can't see myself going on to live a normal life,"" and ""I just want the pain to stop,"" which, in context, reinforces the desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Every day the pain gets worse."" ""For the past week, I haven't thought about anything other than how and when I'm going to take my life."" ""But I can't wait any more."" ""Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there."" These indicate increasing urgency and current, ongoing thoughts of suicide.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   ""how and when I'm going to take my life"" implies planning.
    *   ""I'm too afraid to use any method aside from a gun to the head"" - specific method (gun to the head).
    *   ""Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days until I'm able to."" - confirms a specific plan exists, even if long-term.
    *   ""Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there."" - specific method (kitchen knife) and implied location (""there,"" immediate surroundings). This is a *current* temptation towards a specific method.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past completed suicide attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""take my life"") AND specific plans/methods (""gun to the head,"" ""kitchen knife,"" ""my plan""). The increasing temptation to use a kitchen knife also indicates a current, specific method being considered. This fits the definition of BEHAVIOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""take my life"" is explicit. ""I can't wait any more"" and temptation to ""grab a kitchen knife and do it there"" indicate immediate risk.
*   Between IDEATION/BEHAVIOR: Choose BEHAVIOR because specific methods (gun, kitchen knife) and a plan are mentioned.
*   Not ATTEMPT as no past completed actions are described.

Conclusion: The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts with specific methods and a plan, and increasing urgency/temptation towards an immediate method.

It just feels like everyone in my life is focused on their career goals and I can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of suicide."" It also contains phrases like ""genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live,"" which strongly imply an ongoing struggle with suicidal ideation or a desire to end life.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post is current and immediate in its questioning (""Does inpatient care help?"", ""I'm genuinely trying to find...""). The ""thoughts of suicide"" are presented as ongoing.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The user is asking about treatment options (inpatient care, medication) for their thoughts, not about methods to act on them.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of a past suicide attempt or interrupted attempt by the person writing the post. They are asking if *anyone* having thoughts of suicide benefited from inpatient care, not stating they themselves had an attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts (""thoughts of suicide"") are present. However, there is NO plan, method, or preparation mentioned. According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""thoughts of suicide"" is explicit.
*   No specific plan or method is mentioned, only a general struggle and inquiry about treatment.
*   No past completed action by the poster is mentioned.

Therefore, the post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts but lacks any specific plan or method.

I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge. Can't sleep. No future.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states, ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday."" This directly identifies suicide content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""on Monday"" indicates a specific future timing for the planned action. ""Today"" and ""Everyday"" describe current and ongoing distress.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""Bridge,"" which is a specific location and implies a method (jumping).
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past completed suicide attempts. The statement describes a future intention, not a past action.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""kill myself"").
    *   A specific plan/method (""Bridge"") is mentioned.
    *   This combination aligns with the definition of **BEHAVIOR**. It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described. It is not IDEATION because a specific method is mentioned.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I'm really going to try and kill myself"" is explicit.
*   ""Bridge"" is a specific method/plan, moving it beyond IDEATION.
*   It describes a *future* plan, not a *past completed action*, so it's BEHAVIOR, not ATTEMPT.

Gah but it's so hard. One of the hardest decisions I've taken iny life. Wish I have more sex before I go though lol. Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""kms"" (kill myself) multiple times, ""hangman's noose"" (a method of suicide), ""when I do it"" (referring to suicide), and ""before I go"" (referring to dying by suicide). This clearly indicates explicit suicide content.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Set my wallpaper... just to stay on track"" indicates a current, active thought process and a commitment to a future action. ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" suggests a recent step towards action. ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" indicates a current precondition being met for a future act. ""One of the hardest decisions I've taken in my life"" implies a current, active decision.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The mention of ""hangman's noose"" as wallpaper ""to stay on track"" is a clear indication of a specific method being considered and kept at the forefront of their mind. ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" describes a significant preparation or precondition being met before the act, which falls under preparations.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post does not describe any past *completed* suicide attempts. ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" refers to overcoming an *obstacle* to suicide, not a past attempt.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present (""kms"", ""hangman's noose"").
    *   Specific plan/method (""hangman's noose"") and preparation (""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"") are present.
    *   No past completed attempt is described.

    Based on the rules, explicit suicide thoughts AND a plan/method/preparation lead to **BEHAVIOR**. The ""hangman's noose"" as a constant reminder and the cleared ""hurdle"" for the mother's housing are strong indicators of planning/preparation.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I want to die."" It also includes ""I don't want to be me anymore"" and ""I feel like i've seen enough of my future to want to continue,"" which reinforce a desire to cease existing. The line ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore"" shows ambivalence, but the earlier explicit statement ""I want to die"" is present. According to Critical Rule 2, even with ambivalence, the explicit mention of suicide/death still counts.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I want to die"" indicates a current desire. ""someone please help me"" is a current plea.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (pills, jumping, etc.), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or research about methods are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted attempts are mentioned.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" in the context of extreme distress (""Can't take it anymore,"" ""worthless as fuck,"" ""he'll be better off without me"") is an explicit expression of wanting to end one's life. ""He'll be better off without me"" also strongly implies the speaker's absence, likely through death.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die,"" ""suicide note,"" ""scared of dying,"" and details specific methods like ""exit bag,"" ""aspirin pills,"" ""purchased a gun,"" ""partial suspension hanging,"" ""rope,"" and ""gas valve."" There is clear and repeated explicit mention of suicide and death wishes.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes past events (""At 15, I took..."", ""At 21, I purchased..."", ""Just recently, I purchased rope..."") and current/immediate actions and preparations (""Today, I have an exit bag set up,"" ""When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked.""). This indicates both past actions and current, immediate intent/preparation.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post details multiple specific methods and preparations:
    *   ""exit bag set up"" (current)
    *   ""120 extra strength aspirin pills"" (past attempt)
    *   ""purchased a gun... found where to aim it on my head"" (past interrupted action)
    *   ""purchased rope... read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right"" (past interrupted action)
    *   ""turned that gas valve"" (current interrupted action)
    All these indicate specific plans, methods, and preparations.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:**
    *   ""At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after."" - This is a clear description of a *past completed suicide attempt*. The action was taken with intent to die, and it led to physical consequences and hospitalization.
    *   ""At 21, I purchased a gun... pulled the trigger, nothing happened... couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again..."" - This is an *interrupted attempt* (action initiated, but stopped/failed).
    *   ""Just recently, I purchased rope... I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was... I gave up..."" - This is an *interrupted attempt* (action initiated, but stopped).
    *   ""Today, I have an exit bag set up... When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked... I turned off the gas..."" - This is an *interrupted attempt* (action initiated, but stopped).

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicide thoughts and detailed plans/methods, which would typically lead to BEHAVIOR.
    *   However, the post *also* clearly describes a past *completed* suicide attempt (""At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills... and the hospital visit after."").
    *   According to the ""ATTEMPT"" definition: ""Posts describing past completed suicide attempts... Must involve a concrete action that occurred in the past... If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT.""

484,I'm about to kill myself. I don't see a reason to live. Life sucks.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I'm about to kill myself."" This is a direct and clear mention of suicide. ""I don't see a reason to live"" also reinforces the desire not to be alive.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I'm about to"" indicates immediate and current intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes), or research mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** No past attempts or interrupted actions are described. The statement ""I'm about to"" refers to an imminent future action, not a past one.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""kill myself""). Therefore, it's not INDICATOR.
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""I'm about to kill myself"").
    *   NO specific plan or method is mentioned.
    *   NO past completed attempt is described.
    *   This perfectly matches the definition of IDEATION: ""Posts with explicit expressions of wanting to die, commit suicide, or end their life, but WITHOUT specific plans, methods, or preparations.""

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""face death"" and ""working out until i die"". It also implies death with ""if not, well, you know what happened."" This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The phrases ""I'm now gonna start working out"" and ""I'll be back in 12 hours if i survived"" indicate immediate and current intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** A specific method is described: ""working out until i die or pass out"". This is presented as a means to achieve death. The statement ""I'm now gonna start working out"" indicates an immediate initiation of this plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post describes an action that is about to be initiated (""I'm now gonna start""), not a past completed attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""face death"", ""until i die"") AND a specific plan/method (""working out until i die"") that is about to be put into action. According to the framework, this falls under BEHAVIOR. It's not an ATTEMPT because it's not a past completed action. It's more than IDEATION because a specific method and immediate intent to act are present.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""face death"" and ""until i die"" are explicit.
*   ""Interrupted Actions"": While not an interrupted attempt, the immediate intent to start a lethal action (""I'm now gonna start working out until i die"") fits the ""BEHAVIOR"" category's description of having specific plans/methods/preparations and implying initiation of action.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": This is about a present intention and an immediate future action, not a past event.
*   ""When in Doubt"": It's clearly beyond IDEATION due to the specific method and immediate intent to act. It's not ATTEMPT because it's not a completed past action. Therefore, BEHAVIOR is the correct classification.

I'm sorry for the question but I was hoping someone would be able to talk and help me figure it out.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""contemplated suicide for years,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" and ""plan to be dead long before I retire."" These are clear and explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and intent.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The timing is long-term future (""maybe in my 20's or 30's,"" ""long before I retire""). It's a definite future plan, not immediate, but still a firm intention.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping, hanging), location, or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) is mentioned. The post discusses the *implication* of a future suicide on a retirement plan, not *how* it will be done.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I know I am going to do it,"" ""contemplated suicide"") but does not include any specific plan or method. According to the decision logic, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The expressions are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not applicable.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post discusses a future intention, not a past completed action.
*   **When in Doubt:** The explicit mention of suicide and intent to act, without a specific method, clearly places it in IDEATION. It's more than an INDICATOR due to explicit suicide mention, and less than BEHAVIOR because no plan/method is specified. It's not ATTEMPT as no past action is described.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" explicitly asks about a method for death, indicating a suicidal thought process. ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" in this context strongly implies saving them for the purpose of ending life. Therefore, explicit suicide/death wishes are present.

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The question ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" is a current inquiry. ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" indicates a current possession and a future intent, implying ongoing contemplation and preparation.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:**
    *   Specific method: ""duloxetine"" (a type of pill). Yes, a specific method is identified.
    *   Preparations: ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later."" This describes acquiring and possessing the means, which is a clear preparation.
    *   Research/seeking: ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" This is direct research about the lethality of a specific method.
    *   All criteria for plan/method/preparation are met.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or completed actions. The post focuses on current possession, future intent, and research.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   A specific plan/method (pills) is mentioned, preparations (saving pills) are described, and research into the method is being conducted.
    *   According to the framework: ""If explicit suicide thoughts AND plan/method/preparation → BEHAVIOR.""

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The mention of ""kill you"" and saving pills for that purpose is explicit.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not applicable, no action has been initiated yet.
*   **Past vs. Present:** The post describes current possession and future intent, not a past completed action.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly goes beyond IDEATION because a specific method is mentioned, means are acquired, and research is being done. It is not ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described. It fits BEHAVIOR perfectly.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The phrase ""I just want to end"" is an explicit expression of wanting to end one's life, which falls under ""ending life"" or ""not wanting to be alive.""
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""Today's a great day. It's hell."" indicates current distress. ""I just want to end but haven't yet"" indicates a current desire that has not been acted upon.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research are mentioned.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The phrase ""haven't yet"" explicitly states that no past attempt has occurred.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are mentioned (""I just want to end"").
    *   No plan/method is mentioned.
    *   No past suicide attempt is described (explicitly states ""haven't yet"").
    *   Therefore, this falls under IDEATION.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""I just want to end"" is an explicit death wish, so it's not INDICATOR.
*   There is no plan or method, so it's not BEHAVIOR.
*   There is no past completed action, so it's not ATTEMPT.

It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""I cant off myself"". This clearly indicates explicit suicide/death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""by the end of the day today"" indicates a current and immediate timeframe for the thought. The procrastination aspect explains why it hasn't happened yet, but the *desire* and *potential* are framed as immediate.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions ""go buy the gas"" as a means to ""off myself"". This is a specific method (""gas"") and a specific step towards preparation/acquiring means (""buy the gas"").
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or interrupted actions. The post discusses *what could happen* and *why it hasn't happened yet* (due to procrastination).
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide/death wishes are present.
    *   A specific plan/method (""gas"") and a step towards preparation (""buy the gas"") are mentioned.
    *   No past completed attempt is described.
    *   According to the rules, explicit suicide thoughts AND a plan/method/preparation lead to BEHAVIOR. The mention of ""buy the gas"" is a clear step towards a method.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** ""dead by the end of the day today"" and ""cant off myself"" are explicit.
*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** Not directly applicable, but the thoughts are clearly the person's own.
*   **Interrupted Actions:** Not an interrupted action, but a plan/preparation is present.
*   **Past vs. Present:** Focus is on what *could* happen today, not what *has* happened.
*   **When in Doubt:** This clearly falls between IDEATION and BEHAVIOR. Since a method (""gas"") and a step towards acquiring it (""buy the gas"") are mentioned, it moves from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.

Therefore, the classification is BEHAVIOR.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""I post about suicide constantly""). The phrase ""do it"" clearly refers to committing suicide in this context (""I should stop being a pussy and do it"", ""suck it up and do it already"").
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""should just suck it up and do it already"" indicate a present desire or impulse to act. ""constantly"" refers to the ongoing nature of the thoughts.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), location, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to discussing suicide, not past attempts or self-harm actions. No past attempts or interrupted attempts are described.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Explicit suicide thoughts are present (""suicide"", ""do it""). However, there is NO plan or method mentioned. According to the decision logic, ""If explicit suicide thoughts but NO plan/method → IDEATION"".

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   Explicit vs. Implicit: ""do it"" is explicit given the context.
*   Intrusive Thoughts: Not applicable.
*   Interrupted Actions: Not applicable.
*   Past vs. Present: Focus is on present desire to act.
*   When in Doubt: Explicit suicide mention pushes it to IDEATION over INDICATOR. Lack of method/plan keeps it at IDEATION rather than BEHAVIOR. No past completed action means it's not ATTEMPT.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January."" and ""but now it time to stop the lie and end it."" and ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest"". These are clear mentions of suicide and wanting to die.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes a past plan (""planned to kill myself in January. But I didn't"") but then transitions to a current, urgent intent: ""but now it time to stop the lie and end it."" and ""So I plan to hang myself... Everything is ready"". This indicates a current, immediate intent.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post details a specific plan: ""plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" It also states ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"". This clearly outlines specific methods, a location, and preparations.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post mentions past self-harm: ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself)."" This is self-harm, not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt. The past suicide plan (""planned to kill myself in January"") was explicitly *not* acted upon (""But I didn't"").
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts: Yes.
    *   Plan/method/preparation: Yes, very specific and detailed plans, methods, and preparations are described as current.
    *   Past suicide attempt (completed action): No. The self-harm was for calming, not an attempt to die. The past suicide plan was not completed.
    *   Comparing categories:
        *   Not INDICATOR (explicit suicide content).
        *   Not IDEATION (has specific plans/methods/preparations).
        *   Not ATTEMPT (no *completed* past action with intent to die).
        *   Fits BEHAVIOR perfectly: explicit suicidal thoughts + specific plans, methods, and preparations (""Everything is ready""). The mention of past self-harm and a past *unacted-upon* plan does not change the classification from BEHAVIOR, as the current state is a detailed plan with readiness.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""Explicit vs. Implicit"": ""end it"" is explicit in context, ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself"" are explicit.
*   ""Interrupted Actions"": The post describes preparations and readiness for a *future* action, not an interrupted past action.
*   ""Past vs. Present"": While past events are mentioned, the core of the post is about a current plan and readiness (""now it time to stop the lie and end it,"" ""So I plan to hang myself,"" ""Everything is ready"").
*   ""When in Doubt"": Clearly BEHAVIOR over IDEATION due to detailed plan/method/preparations. Clearly BEHAVIOR over ATTEMPT because it's a *plan* with *readiness*, not a *completed past action*.

We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post contains ""I wish I was never born,"" which is an explicit expression of not wanting to exist or be alive. It also contains ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"" and ""no point for us being here,"" indicating existential despair. Crucially, it states ""but at the same time don't really want to die.""

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** There are no immediate urgency indicators like ""tonight,"" ""today,"" or ""now."" The statements are general and reflect ongoing existential thoughts.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions a desire for non-existence (""I wish I was never born"").
    *   Although the user states ""don't really want to die,"" this is similar to the ""Intrusive Thoughts"" rule: ""Even if someone says 'my brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to,' this is still IDEATION because suicide is explicitly mentioned."" Here, the concept of not wanting to be alive/exist is explicitly mentioned, even if the user expresses a lack of desire to act on it.
    *   There is no plan or method, ruling out BEHAVIOR.
    *   There is no past completed action, ruling out ATTEMPT.
    *   The explicit mention of ""I wish I was never born"" (a form of not wanting to be alive/exist) means it's more than just general distress without explicit death wishes (INDICATOR).
    *   Applying the ""When in Doubt"" rule: ""Between INDICATOR/IDEATION: Choose IDEATION if ANY explicit death/suicide mention."" ""I wish I was never born"" counts as an explicit mention of not wanting to be alive/exist.

Therefore, despite the negation, the explicit mention of a desire for non-existence places it in IDEATION.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post expresses significant distress, shame, and fear about social judgment (""I am very ashamed"", ""I know I messed up big time"", ""afraid of everyone will think of me"", ""disgusting""). However, there is *no* explicit mention of suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, or not wanting to be alive. There are also no phrases like ""going to die"", ""want to be gone"", ""don't want to survive"", or ""want it to be over"" in the context of ending one's life. The distress is focused on social perception and asking for ""help"" on ""What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting.""

2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post describes current feelings of shame and fear (""I am very ashamed"", ""I am afraid"") related to an upcoming event (""about to start in a new school""). There are no urgency or timing indicators related to immediate suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is absolutely no mention of specific suicide methods, locations, preparations, or research.

4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.

5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, the post falls into the INDICATOR category. The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and general dissatisfaction with life circumstances (social shame) WITHOUT any explicit mention of suicide, death wishes, or wanting to die.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""they don't let you kill yourself."" This is a direct and explicit mention of suicide. The phrases ""you suddenly get sick of it"" and ""why do you want me to suffer"" further contextualize the desire to end life/suffering.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** The post uses general phrasing (""they don't let you"", ""why do you want me""). It doesn't indicate immediate intent (""tonight"", ""now"") nor describe a past event (""I tried""). It expresses an ongoing frustration or thought about being prevented from ending one's life.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), specific locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or research into methods.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no description of any past attempts (completed actions) or interrupted attempts.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**

    *   There is no description of a past completed suicide attempt, so it's not ATTEMPT.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   ""they don't let you kill yourself"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die/commit suicide.
*   No specific plan or method is detailed.
*   No past completed action is described.

1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I hope it'll be me next"" in the context of stabbings, indicating a wish for death. It also explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family with a suicide""). This clearly identifies suicidal content.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""I hope it'll be me next"" indicates a current desire for a future event. There are no past attempt indicators.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post mentions a specific method: ""stabbing."" While the person isn't planning to inflict it themselves, they are expressing a desire for death via this specific method, which functions as a ""method"" in the context of their suicidal thoughts. The location is ""my area"" where stabbings occur. This constitutes a specific method linked to the suicidal ideation.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** The post contains explicit suicide thoughts (""I hope it'll be me next,"" ""suicide"") AND a specific method (""stabbing""). This aligns with the ""BEHAVIOR"" category. It is not an ATTEMPT because no past completed action is described. It is beyond IDEATION because a specific method is mentioned.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**

I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!. THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!. I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post explicitly states ""I tried to kill myself last night,"" ""ALMOST KILL MYSELF,"" ""ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!,"" and ""I'm gonna try again tonight."" These are clear and explicit mentions of suicide and death wishes.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** ""last night"" indicates a past event. ""tonight"" indicates immediate future intent. ""I'm gonna try again tonight"" shows immediate urgency. ""I have another plan in mind"" indicates a contingency plan.
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** The post details a specific method used ""last night"": ""via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets."" It also states ""I'm gonna try again tonight"" (implying the same or similar method) and ""I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful,"" indicating a specific, albeit undisclosed, backup plan.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** The post explicitly describes a past action: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag."" This is a concrete action taken with intent to die. The phrase ""EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE"" suggests a pattern of such initiated actions.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:**
    *   Explicit suicide thoughts are present.
    *   Specific plans and methods are mentioned for both past actions and current/future intent.
    *   A past suicide attempt is clearly described (""I tried to kill myself last night"").
    *   According to the rules, ""ATTEMPT: Posts describing past completed suicide attempts - actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome."" The action of attempting suffocation fits this.
    *   Also, ""If past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, still classify as ATTEMPT."" This post mentions a past attempt and current plans (""I'm gonna try again tonight"").
    *   The critical rule regarding ""Interrupted Actions"" states: ""If someone describes putting a noose around their neck, taking pills, etc., but stopped - this is BEHAVIOR (plan + action), not ATTEMPT."" However, the definition of ATTEMPT emphasizes ""actual actions that were taken with intent to die, regardless of outcome."" The phrase ""I tried to kill myself"" indicates the action was initiated with intent. The outcome (breathing) does not negate the attempt. Given the explicit ""I tried to kill myself"" and the detail of the action, it falls under ATTEMPT. The ""When in Doubt"" rule for BEHAVIOR/ATTEMPT says: ""Choose ATTEMPT only for completed past actions."" The act of putting on the mask and bag with intent to die is a completed past action of attempting.

Final classification aligns with ATTEMPT due to the clear description of a past action taken with intent to die, combined with current plans.

I've got a lot to be happy about right now, I'm playing rugby with a very inclusive team, I'm starting my second year at uni in 3 weeks, I have an amazing bf and an awesome best friend and I'm 4 months on hrt . I'm just soooo tierd, I just want to sleep 24/7, I feel empty and I'm worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **SUICIDE CONTENT IDENTIFICATION:** The post mentions ""Just don't want to get out of bed,"" ""soooo tierd,"" ""just want to sleep 24/7,"" ""feel empty,"" and ""worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔."" None of these phrases explicitly mention suicide, killing self, ending life, wanting to die, being dead, not wanting to be alive, going to die, want to be gone, don't want to survive, or want it to be over. The desire to sleep 24/7 is a symptom of fatigue/depression, not a wish for death.
2.  **URGENCY AND TIMING INDICATORS:** There are no urgency or timing indicators related to suicidal intent. The post describes current feelings and a future event (starting uni).
3.  **PLAN/METHOD ASSESSMENT:** There is no mention of any specific plans, methods, locations, preparations, or research related to suicide.
4.  **ACTION HISTORY:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, or self-harm behaviors. ""Another depressive episode"" refers to a mental health state, not a suicide attempt.
5.  **DECISION LOGIC:** Since there are NO explicit suicide/death wishes mentioned, the classification falls under INDICATOR.

**Critical Classification Rules Check:**
*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** No explicit or implicit death wishes are present. The post describes general distress and symptoms of depression.
*   **When in Doubt:** The post clearly fits the definition of INDICATOR as there is no explicit mention of suicide or death wishes, only distress and depressive symptoms.
