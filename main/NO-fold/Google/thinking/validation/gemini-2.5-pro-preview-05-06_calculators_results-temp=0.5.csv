0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ending my life again"", ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""Never will find love"", ""mental breakdown"", ""everything in my life is crap even me"", ""I wish I was even attractive enough"", ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""go to a bridge and jump off"" is a specific method (jumping) and a specific type of location (bridge).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""ending my life again"". This suggests a recurrence of suicidal thoughts or possibly past actions, but it's phrased as ""thinking about ending my life again,"" which points to recurring ideation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""ending my life"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""ending my life"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump off"" is a method, and ""a bridge"" is a specific type of location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations (like writing a note or acquiring means other than identifying a method/location) are mentioned, but a clear method and location are stated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""ending my life again"" refers to a recurrence of thoughts from the past. ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" refers to current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The phrase ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" suggests recurring *thoughts* about ending life, not necessarily a concrete past *action* or attempt. The 'Attempt' definition requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"" and states ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" The ""again"" refers to the ""thinking about ending my life,"" implying past ideation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""ending my life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post includes a specific plan/method (""go to a bridge and jump off""). This rules out 'Ideation' (which is defined as *without* any specific plan).
    *   The post describes current suicidal thoughts (""thinking about ending my life"", ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"") along with a specific plan/method (""go to a bridge and jump off""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations (e.g. bridges... to jump off from)"".
    *   Regarding 'Attempt': The phrase ""thinking about ending my life again"" refers to recurring ideation rather than a clearly described past concrete action (attempt). The definition of 'Attempt' specifies that ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"" and ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" Since the ""again"" refers to the *thinking* part, it doesn't meet the criteria for a past attempt being described. The rule ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" is not triggered because a past attempt (concrete action) is not clearly described.

Therefore, the post describes current suicidal ideation with a specific plan, classifying it as 'Behavior'.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""going to die soon"" is a mention of dying. Suicide or self-harm is not explicitly stated.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""inconsolable"" indicates severe distress, despair, or hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post says ""going to die soon,"" but does not explicitly state ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or other direct terms for self-inflicted death.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. ""Going to die soon"" is a statement about an impending event, not explicitly phrased as a desire (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive"").
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Given that suicide is not explicitly mentioned and it's not a direct expression of desire to die, there is unclarity. The rule suggests leaning towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   This step is more relevant if 'ideation' or 'behavior' is being considered. Since the analysis points away from explicit suicide mention, this strengthens the case against 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""soon"" indicates current or near-future intentions/expectations.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post contains ""inconsolable"" (strong emotional distress) and ""going to die soon"" (a statement about impending death).
    *   The **Indicator** definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   The **Ideation** definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan...""
    *   In this post, ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself"" is not explicitly mentioned. ""Going to die soon"" is a statement about dying, but the cause (suicide) is implied, not explicit.
    *   The phrase ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" or ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" for Ideation is not clearly met. ""Going to die soon"" is not an explicit desire, nor is the ""suicidal"" nature of the thought explicitly stated in the words used.
    *   The rule ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'"" and ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" are key. Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and there's ambiguity, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category according to the provided definitions. While the implication of suicide is strong due to ""inconsolable,"" the definitions require explicitness for higher categories.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I hate living"" and ""sometime i think about why i have to live"" are present. No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong negative emotions like hatred towards living, frustration (""fuck""). This implies deep dissatisfaction and potentially hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I hate living"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""sometime i think about why i have to live"" reinforces questioning the will to live, which is a form of suicidal thought. This fits the 'Ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there is no plan, it cannot be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I hate living"" and ""sometime i think about"" refer to current feelings and thoughts.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains ""I hate living,"" which is an explicit expression of a desire not to be alive. It also mentions ""sometime i think about why i have to live,"" indicating thoughts about not wanting to live. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    It is not 'Indicator' because ""I hate living"" goes beyond ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" or ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness""; it's a direct statement about not wanting to live.
    It is not 'Behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned.
    It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators: ""Help me"" indicates distress and a plea.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""barbiturates/Nembutal"" are specific substances (methods). The act of asking for help to ""find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal"" indicates seeking means, which is a form of preparation/planning.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Help me kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""barbiturates/Nembutal""). These are specific lethal medications.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post is an attempt to acquire the means (""help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal""). This is an active step in planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Help me kill myself"", ""help me find"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and expresses a desire to die. It also mentions a specific method (""barbiturates/Nembutal"") and shows an active step towards acquiring these means (""help me find""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs...)"". The act of seeking specific drugs is a form of preparation/planning.

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""painless way to die"", ""want to sleep forever"", ""don't know how to die"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""struggling"", ""unmotivated"", ""feel so sorry"", ""selfish"", ""lazy ass"", ""world scares me"", ""fear intimacy"", ""feel worthless"", ""tired"". Strong indicators of hopelessness and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post asks ""Is there a painless way to die"" and ""how to die with certainty and without pain"". This is an inquiry about methods, but not a stated plan or acquired means.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, phrases like ""painless way to die"" and ""how to die"" in the context of ""want to sleep forever"" are direct expressions of wanting to end one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. ""I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die."" ""Is there a painless way to die.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is clear enough to be considered an explicit expression of wanting to die.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): The post *inquires* about methods (""painless way to die"", ""how to die with certainty and without pain"") but does not state a chosen method, nor does it indicate that the person has acquired means or decided on a specific method. It is a question about methods, not a statement of a plan involving a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The user is asking *how* to die, which is a strong form of ideation but does not yet constitute a specific plan with a chosen method or preparation.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current/future intentions (""I want to sleep forever"", ""how to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""want to sleep forever"", ""how to die""). This moves it beyond 'indicator'.
    *   The post inquires about methods (""painless way to die,"" ""how to die with certainty and without pain"") but does not state a specific plan, chosen method, or preparations. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and *also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide* or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Asking about methods is part of suicidal ideation, but it's not yet a formulated plan with a specific method.
    *   There are no mentions of past attempts.
    *   Therefore, the category 'Ideation' is the most fitting because there's an explicit desire to die, but no specific plan or method is outlined. The inquiry about methods is a strong form of ideation.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""want to die"", ""when you're dead"", ""kill ourselves"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""pointless"", ""nothing matters"", ""huge waste of time"", ""feeling that life is all pointless"". Strong sense of hopelessness and existential despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post is a philosophical questioning of the value of life.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""all the things that made me want to kill myself are solved"". This refers to past *reasons* for suicidal thoughts, not a specific past *action* or attempt. It does not state ""I tried to kill myself in the past"".

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""kill ourselves"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""i still want to die"", ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan is mentioned, this points away from 'behavior'.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post focuses on current feelings (""i still want to die"", ""now im just left with the feeling that life is all pointless"") and philosophical considerations about the future (""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The phrase ""all the things that made me want to kill myself are solved"" refers to the resolution of *causes* of past suicidal thoughts, not a description of a past attempt (a concrete action).

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and wanting to die (""i still want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   While it refers to past *reasons* for wanting to die, it does not describe a past *attempt* (a concrete action). The focus is on current ideation. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""want to be gone tonight"" - strong implication of wanting to die.
        *   ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" - could imply self-harm ideation or a desire for the end.
        *   ""I want it to be over tonight"" - strong implication of wanting life to end.
        *   ""I don't wanna survive it"" - explicit desire to die.
        *   ""I want it to stop"" - referring to life/pain, wanting it to end.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):
        *   ""so much mental pain""
        *   ""I can't handle it""
        *   ""I hate everything""
        *   ""I need peace"" (often a euphemism for death in such contexts).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (like pills, weapons, location), or preparations (like writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. Phrases like ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" and ""I don't wanna survive it"" are direct and explicit expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expressions of wanting to die are quite clear and explicit. The definition of Ideation is ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". This post clearly contains such expressions. The Indicator definition states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post *has* direct indications of suicidal thoughts/feelings. Therefore, it is not Indicator.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is mentioned, this confirms it's not 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""tonight"" clearly indicates current and imminent future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die (""want to be gone tonight,"" ""don't wanna survive it""). This aligns with the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   The post does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not **Behavior**.
    *   The post does not describe a past attempt, so it is not **Attempt**.
    *   The post goes beyond ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and contains ""direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings,"" making it more than **Indicator**. The desire to die is explicit. The Indicator definition states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post clearly has such indications. The Ideation definition also states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" A desire to die is clearly expressed here.

Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' category.

    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expression ""I just wanna die"" is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive. The definition of 'Ideation' includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". The rule ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" implies that if a desire to die *is* expressed, it should be considered for 'Ideation' (or higher if a plan is present).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.

    The post contains a clear and direct expression of wanting to die (""I just wanna die""). This goes beyond a ""vague feeling about dying or death"" (Indicator) and fits the ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" part of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.

However, it's immediately followed by ""but I don't actually want to."" This negates a current *desire* to die, but the suicidal thoughts are explicitly stated as being present. The definition of Ideation includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"". The thoughts are present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit mention of suicide (""kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' requires the *lack* of any explicit expression concerning suicide.
    *   The post does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not describe any past suicide attempts. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself""). While the user states they ""don't actually want to"" act on these thoughts, the thoughts themselves are present and are suicidal in nature. The definition of 'Ideation' is ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The presence of these thoughts, even if unwanted or resisted, constitutes suicidal ideation. The negation of desire to act is important for risk level but doesn't change the classification from ideation when the thoughts are explicitly stated.

Ive seen the way they talk about me and while its not malicius or anything like that its obvious they try to not talk about me.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to ... kill myself"", ""want to die now"", ""shoot their heads off like me"", ""run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""don't have anything"", ""stuck, stagnant"", ""no space for me"", ""incurable disease or something is wrong with my brain"", ""damaged"", ""can't feel nothing"", ""falling down this void"", ""theyre gonna be better off without me"", ""too weird"". Strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, alienation, and feeling like a burden.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids"". These are specific methods being considered.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes (""want to die now"", ""want to ... kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - Yes. Methods mentioned are ""run towards a cop with a knife"" (involves a tool: knife) and ""find a dealer with some opioids"" (involves a substance: opioids).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No explicit signs of preparation like having acquired the means or written a note, but specific methods are being actively considered.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The mention of ""either... or..."" with specific actions and means (""knife"", ""opioids"") indicates more than just ideation. It's a consideration of *how*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current/future intentions (""want to die now"", ""either i run... or find..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and a desire to die (""want to die now""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond general suicidal thoughts by mentioning specific methods being considered: ""run towards a cop with a knife"" and ""find a dealer with some opioids"". These are specific methods involving a tool (knife) and a substance (opioids).
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method... (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons...).""
    *   The mention of ""knife"" and ""opioids"" as part of potential actions fits the criteria for ""specific method"" involving ""tools/weapons"" and ""lethal medication/drugs"".
    *   While the user expresses some uncertainty (""i dont know, i wouldnt know""), they are clearly laying out specific potential actions/methods. This is more than just ideation without a plan.
    *   Therefore, the category 'Behavior' is the most appropriate.

I'm deteriorating. I just want to get it over with. I'm not alone, but I can't tell anyone either. I refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will. The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post includes ""I just want to get it over with,"" which in this context implies a desire for life to end. It also mentions ""if I go through with it"" and contemplates ""How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last,"" referring to the consequences of an act to end life.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses significant distress: ""It's not working anymore,"" ""I haven't slept in weeks,"" ""I'm deteriorating,"" ""The only thing that scares me is the pain."" There's a sense of hopelessness and being overwhelmed.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: There are no references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., using the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"")? No, these specific words are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just want to get it over with"" is a direct expression of wanting the current suffering (and by implication, life) to end. The phrase ""if I go through with it"" further clarifies that ""it"" refers to an act of ending life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrases ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""if I go through with it"" in the context of extreme distress and deterioration are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end. This is more than a vague feeling.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post talks about the fear of pain from ""it"" but not *how* ""it"" would be done.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan or method is mentioned, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and potential future intentions (""if I go through with it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post clearly expresses a desire for the current suffering to end (""I just want to get it over with"") and contemplation of an act to make it end (""if I go through with it""), including fear of the pain from such an act. This constitutes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which is the definition of 'Ideation'.
    It is not 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and is for ""general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post contains direct indications of suicidal thoughts. The phrases used are explicit expressions of a desire for life to end, even if the word ""suicide"" itself isn't used.
    It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    It is not 'Attempt' because it describes current thoughts and potential future actions, not a past attempt.
    Therefore, the category 'Ideation' is the most appropriate.

I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is a significant element. While not using the word ""suicide"" or ""death"" directly, ""leave myself"" in this context strongly implies a desire to cease existing or escape one's own being.
    *   Note emotional indicators: The post expresses strong feelings of hopelessness (""no one sticks around. everyone leaves you eventually""), self-blame (""maybe it's me?""), resignation (""I do not blame these people one bit""), and persistent emotional pain (""it still hurts"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or phrases like ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is interpreted as an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive or to cease existing. This aligns with the definition of Ideation which includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While ""suicide"" isn't explicitly named, the desire expressed in ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is quite clear in its implication of wanting to escape one's own existence, which is a core component of suicidal ideation. It's more than a vague feeling.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there is no plan or method, 'Behavior' is not the correct category.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and a current hypothetical wish (""I'd leave myself if I could"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not the correct category.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains significant emotional distress and hopelessness.
    *   The key phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" expresses a desire to cease existing or escape oneself. This is considered an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which is the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It's more specific and direct than ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" or a ""vague feeling about dying or death"" (which would be 'Indicator'). The desire, though phrased metaphorically, is explicit.
    *   There is no mention of a plan or method, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" is considered. While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the expression ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is a clear articulation of a desire to not be alive, fitting the criteria for 'Ideation'. The Ideation definition explicitly includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" as a form of ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No. Only a future timeframe (""at 21"") is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The ""plan"" mentioned is a temporal one, not one involving a specific method or means as described in the 'Behavior' definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current distress and a future intention (""plan to kill myself at 21"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and a plan to do so (""at 21""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There are no mentions of past attempts, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
        *   'Behavior' is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...).""
    *   The post states ""i plan to kill myself at 21"". This is a plan in terms of timing. However, the definition of 'Behavior' emphasizes a ""specific method or preparations taken"" and provides examples like tools, substances, or locations. A temporal plan (""at 21"") alone, without any indication of *how* the person intends to do it, does not meet the specificity required for 'Behavior' as per its definition. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" also supports this. Since the plan lacks a method or preparation details, it falls under 'Ideation'.

    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"") and mentions suicide (""kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post expresses a desire to die and suicidal thoughts.
    *   However, it explicitly states there is no immediate plan (""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon"").

However, it's accompanied by ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" and ""I don't really have the guts to do it"". No explicit preparations are mentioned (e.g., acquiring a rope, choosing a location, writing a note).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging"" is explicitly mentioned as something ""considered"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, the post indicates an inability or lack of ""guts"" to follow through, suggesting no active preparations.
    *   The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The mention of ""hanging"" is a specific method. Even though the person expresses ambivalence or inability to act (""can't seem to go through with it""), the *mention* of a specific method is present. The Ideation definition's note is quite direct in pushing this towards 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The feelings and suicidal thoughts (including the consideration of hanging) are presented as current.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   The post is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is for explicit suicidal thoughts ""without any specific plan"". However, its definition includes a crucial note: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   'Behavior' is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".
    *   The post mentions ""hanging"", which is a specific method. According to the note in the 'Ideation' definition, this should be classified as 'Behavior'. The 'Behavior' definition itself supports this, as ""a specific method"" is listed as a form of ""explicit planning"".
    *   The user's ambivalence (""can't seem to go through with it"", ""don't have the guts"") relates to their perceived capability or resolve to act, but it doesn't negate the fact that a specific method of suicide was mentioned as having been considered. The definitions seem to prioritize the mention of a method for categorization into 'Behavior'.
    *   The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" is considered. However, the definitions are quite specific that mentioning a method moves it to 'Behavior'. ""Considered hanging"" is a clear mention of a specific method. The 'Behavior' definition clarifies that ""a specific method"" constitutes ""some form of explicit planning"".

Therefore, based on the explicit mention of suicide and a specific method (""hanging""), the post fits the 'Behavior' category according to the provided definitions, particularly the note in the 'Ideation' definition.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""i already got my suicidal notes ready."" This is a very explicit sign of preparation.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". The presence of ""suicidal notes ready"" directly fits this.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings (""im sick of"", ""im tired of"", ""i feel so ugly"") and past actions taken to change appearance (""i've dyed and cut my hair"", ""ive started doing more makeup"", ""i got new clothes"", ""i ate less, and i ate more""). The core sentiment is current.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress, self-loathing, and a desire to escape the current self. However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The definition of ""Indicator"" states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" The post shows very large general dissatisfaction with oneself and feelings of hopelessness about one's appearance, but suicide or a desire to die is not explicitly mentioned. The wish to ""be someone else"" is a strong expression of dissatisfaction but not a direct expression of suicidal ideation. Therefore, it fits the ""Indicator"" category.

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""kill themselves"" and ""hurt themselves."" However, these mentions are in the context of what *other people* post, not what the author is feeling or planning. The author is asking a question about *others'* motivations.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The author expresses an opinion (""In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help..."") but does not express personal hopelessness or despair. The tone is analytical or questioning.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the author. The post discusses others who might post about being ""in the process of doing so,"" but this is a hypothetical scenario about other users.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None related to the author.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS (for the author):**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned by the author about themselves? No. The author is discussing the topic of suicide posts made by others.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive from the author? No.
    *   The rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"" is key here. The author is not expressing any personal suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for the author):**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned by the author for themselves? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation by the author? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT (for the author):**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions of the author? Neither. The post is a general discussion/question about other people's posts.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described by the author? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post is a meta-commentary on other people's posts about suicide. The author themself does not express any personal suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts. The mentions of ""kill themselves"" or ""hurt themselves"" are explicitly attributed to ""anyone that posts that they are going to kill themselves,"" not the author of this specific post.
    According to the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide [from the author]. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings [from the author]."" This fits because the author is not expressing anything about their own suicidal state. Even though the word ""suicide"" (or similar) is present, it's not about the author's own feelings or intentions. The rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"" reinforces this.
    *   **Ideation:** Requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" from the author. This is absent.
    *   **Behavior:** Requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" by the author. This is absent.
    *   **Attempt:** Requires ""describes past attempts at suicide"" by the author. This is absent.

    Since the post is about the topic of suicide but does not reflect any personal suicidal risk for the author, it falls into the 'Indicator' category. The author is discussing the phenomenon, not expressing personal distress or suicidal intent.

    *   **Are specific methods mentioned (for a current attempt)?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation (for a current attempt)?** No.
    *   The post does not detail a current plan, so it would not be 'Behavior' based on current intent alone.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

        *   Past events: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed.""
        *   Current intentions/feelings: ""Im so tired of being alive,"" ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself.""
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** Yes, the post states ""the past two times ive tried ive failed,"" indicating two past attempts that were unsuccessful.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""kill myself"") and wanting to die, so it's beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   It expresses current suicidal ideation (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"") but without a specific current plan, which would point to 'Ideation' if past attempts were not mentioned.
    *   However, the post clearly states, ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" This is a direct description of past suicide attempts.
    *   The definition of **Attempt** is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   The post clearly describes past attempts. It also mentions current suicidal ideation (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself""). Even if ""current plans"" in the note is interpreted strictly as 'Behavior'-level plans (which are not present), the primary condition for 'Attempt' (""The content describes past attempts at suicide"") is met. The presence of current ideation alongside past attempts strongly solidifies the 'Attempt' classification as per the provided rules.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly for the train method, but the ideation is strong. The focus for this step is often on current/future plans. However, the 'Attempt' category handles past actions.

Then I think about how many fucking issues I already have and its just too much. I'm going insane what the fuck do I do?

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" is present. This indicates a belief that life would be unlivable or not worth living without estrogen. No direct mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post is filled with strong negative emotions: ""very worried,"" ""fucking horrified,"" ""keep crying,"" ""panic attacks,"" ""worry,"" ""too much,"" ""going insane,"" ""what the fuck do I do?,"" ""scared."" This indicates severe distress and hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" or synonyms like ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. The statement ""I can't live without estrogen"" is interpreted as an explicit expression that life would be unlivable or undesirable without estrogen, which implies a conditional desire to not be alive or a belief that life would not be sustainable. This fits the 'ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" While conditional, it's an explicit statement about the perceived viability of life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   Since no plan or method is identified, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current distress and fears about a future possibility (losing access to estrogen or HRT being harmful). The statement ""I can't live without estrogen"" refers to a potential future state.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post shows extreme emotional distress.
    *   Suicide is not explicitly named, but the phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" is a strong, explicit statement indicating that life would be perceived as unlivable or not worth continuing under that specific condition. This qualifies as an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" as per the 'ideation' definition.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of past attempts, so it is not 'attempt'.
    *   While the post shows significant distress (which could be 'indicator'), the statement ""I can't live without estrogen"" elevates it beyond general distress to express a condition under which the person feels they cannot continue living. This aligns with 'ideation'. The 'indicator' definition states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The phrase in question is a direct indication of such feelings, albeit conditional.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Now it's time to end it"" strongly implies suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""NO hope left,"" ""don't even eat"" (hopelessness, despair).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods or preparations for the current intention are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" This strongly suggests past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""So I tried. And I tried again..."" refers to past events. ""Now it's time to end it"" refers to current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The phrase ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" strongly implies past attempts, although the specific actions are not detailed. The repetition and context suggest these were attempts to end life.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post expresses a current desire to die (""Now it's time to end it""). This would point to 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. Since no specific plan for the current intention is mentioned, it would lean towards 'Ideation' if only considering the current state.
    However, the post also states, ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" This is a clear reference to past actions. The definition of 'Attempt' is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    The phrase ""So I tried"" in the context of numerous failed treatments and the subsequent declaration ""Now it's time to end it"" strongly implies these were past suicide attempts.
    Given the rule ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt',"" this post fits the 'Attempt' category.

The statement ""I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family but I've given up in life"" also points to this.

    *   The post explicitly mentions preparations: ""I have a plan, note and date"". The ""note"" is a specific example of preparation mentioned in the definition of 'Behavior'.

    *   'Attempt' is not suitable as it refers to future intentions, not a past action.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...).""

        *   The post describes a dilemma: go to ER and state intent to ""kill myself"" or ""actually do go through with it and kill myself.""
        *   No specific method for suicide is detailed if that option is chosen.
        *   ""cuts I have all over myself"" indicates self-harm.
        *   ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" acts as a form of preparation or a suicide note.
    *   References to past attempts: ""cuts I have all over myself"" implies past or ongoing self-harm, but not explicitly a distinct past suicide *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""actually do go through with it and kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for suicide is detailed. The ""plan"" is more of a decision between seeking help (while stating suicidal intent) or proceeding with suicide (method unspecified).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" can be seen as a preparatory act (like a note). The mention of ""cuts I have all over myself"" is an explicit statement of self-harming behavior.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior."" The post states, ""how many cuts I have all over myself,"" which is a clear exhibition of self-harm.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current crisis and future intentions (""suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently,"" ""I'm still debating on this,"" ""this will probably be my last post ever"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No distinct past suicide *attempt* is detailed. The ""cuts"" refer to self-harm, which may be ongoing or recent, but not framed as a specific past attempt to die.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide **or exhibits self-harming behavior**.""
        *   Explicit suicidal thoughts: Yes.
        *   Plan: The plan to ""kill myself"" is mentioned, though the method isn't specified. The ""goodbye"" is a preparatory act.
        *   Exhibits self-harming behavior: Yes, ""how many cuts I have all over myself"" is a direct statement of self-harm.
    *   Since the post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts AND exhibits self-harming behavior (""cuts I have all over myself""), it fits the 'Behavior' category.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because it doesn't describe a *past* suicide attempt; the focus is on current ideation, behavior, and potential future action.

The presence of ""cuts I have all over myself"" alongside explicit suicidal ideation and the ""goodbye"" message strongly points to 'Behavior' based on the provided definitions, specifically the clause ""or exhibits self-harming behavior.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   Emotional indicators: ""so tired"", ""can't commit to it"", ""not special to anything or anyone or myself"", ""there's no me at this point"", ""don't believe it"", ""brain playing with me"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, and a sense of worthlessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km"". This mentions a specific location (""clif"") and implies a method (jumping).
    *   References to past attempts: None.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""clif"" is mentioned as a location, implying jumping as a method. The distance (""4-5km"") and accessibility (""its possible to get there"") suggest some level of thought about the plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Knowing a ""good clif"" and its location/distance can be considered a form of preparation or at least specific planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""i can't kill myself"", ""its possible to get there"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and expresses suicidal thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post includes a specific location (""clif"") which implies a method (jumping). The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from...))"".
    *   The mention of ""a good clif"" and its distance (""4-5km"") constitutes mentioning a specific location suitable for suicide, which falls under the 'Behavior' category, even if the person states they ""can't commit to it"" at the moment. The plan element is present.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as there is no description of a past attempt.
    *   It is more than 'Ideation' because a specific location and implied method are mentioned, fulfilling the criteria for 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains phrases like ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born."" These phrases imply a desire for life to end or a regret of existence, which are related to death/non-existence, but do not use the word ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"" directly.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is saturated with strong negative emotional indicators: ""tired of everything,"" ""tired of feeling this way,"" ""tired of my life,"" ""tired of hating myself,"" ""crying myself to sleep,"" ""afraid,"" ""feeling disgusting,"" ""ugly,"" ""hopelessness"" (""nothing going for me"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to past attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""i wish i was never born"" is a direct expression of wishing for non-existence. ""i just want it all to stop"" also strongly implies a desire for life and its suffering to cease, which can be interpreted as a desire to not be alive.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.** While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrase ""i wish i was never born"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive, which fits the definition of 'Ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer""). The 'Ideation' definition does not strictly require the word ""suicide"" but rather the expression of the feeling/desire.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** Not applicable as no plan is suggested.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current feelings (""i'm tired,"" ""i wish,"" ""i want""). The desire ""i wish i was never born"" and ""i just want it all to stop"" are current.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness. Crucially, it contains ""i wish i was never born"" and ""i just want it all to stop."" These are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive or for life to end.
    According to the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post.
    It is not 'Indicator' because while ""suicide"" isn't explicitly mentioned by word, the desire to not be alive (""wish I was never born"") is explicit and goes beyond ""general expressions of distress"" or ""vague feeling about dying."" The 'Ideation' definition clarifies that ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" qualifies.
    It is not 'Behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned.
    It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    The phrases ""i wish i was never born"" and ""i just want it all to stop"" are strong enough to be considered explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, thus classifying as 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""Depressed"", ""shit show"", ""fake ass friends"", ""shitty family"", anger (""one last big fuck you"").

    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""kill myself"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it all"" is a clear expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""no one really understands,"" ""doubt anyone will care"" indicate feelings of isolation and hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""already know how I'm gonna do it"" indicates a plan exists, even if not detailed. ""gonna wait a few weeks"" indicates a timeline, which is a form of preparation. ""So goodbye everybody"" can be seen as a form of a suicide note.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""all ready tried that before"" is mentioned. This phrase is ambiguous. It could refer to a past suicide attempt, or it could refer to past attempts to communicate distress or suicidal thoughts which were not understood (""no one really understands""). The definition of 'Attempt' requires the content to *describe* past attempts or a concrete action. This phrase is not a clear description of a past physical attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""end it all"" in this context is an explicit reference to suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""end it all.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No, the specific method is not detailed, but the post states, ""I already know how I'm gonna do it,"" indicating the person has a method in mind.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - Yes:
        *   Stating ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" implies mental preparation and having a plan.
        *   ""gonna wait a few weeks"" indicates a timeline and forethought.
        *   ""So goodbye everybody"" functions as a farewell.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Primarily current/future intentions (""I'm ready to just end it all,"" ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks,"" ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - ""all ready tried that before"" is mentioned. However, this phrase does not *describe* a past attempt in a way that confirms a concrete action took place, as required by the 'Attempt' category definition (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)""). It could mean trying to communicate feelings or previous ideation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""end it all"").
    *   The post mentions a plan: ""I already know how I'm gonna do it."" This is a statement about having a plan.
    *   The post mentions preparations/timeline: ""gonna wait a few weeks.""
    *   The definition of **Behavior** is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
        *   ""end it all"" = explicit suicidal thoughts.
        *   ""already know how I'm gonna do it"" = mentions a plan.
        *   ""gonna wait a few weeks"" = preparation/timeline.
    *   The phrase ""all ready tried that before"" is ambiguous. If it clearly described a past attempt, and current plans were present, 'Attempt' would be the category. However, it does not meet the 'Attempt' definition's requirement of ""describes past attempts"" or ""a concrete action need to have happened."" It's more likely a reference to past expressions of distress or ideation that were not understood.
    *   Given the explicit ideation, the stated existence of a plan, and a timeline, the post fits the 'Behavior' category. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" does not apply here, as the person explicitly states they *have* a plan (""already know how I'm gonna do it"").

    The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill my self"") and a desire for death. It also mentions a specific method (""the blade"") and an action taken with that method (""I hold the blade""). This goes beyond ideation. The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life...)."" Holding a blade in the context of wanting to die is an exhibition of behavior related to a suicide plan, even if the act of suicide itself is stated as not completed in that moment (""can't fucking do it""). It's not 'Attempt' as the action was not completed. It's not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions. It's 'Behavior' because a specific method and an action involving that method are described.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The phrase ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"" is a direct expression of a thought about dying, framed as a rhetorical question in response to perceived lack of acceptance. This constitutes an explicit expression of a suicidal thought or a thought about not being alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and a current thought/rhetorical question about dying (""how about i die then"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant emotional distress (""depressed,"" feelings of alienation).
    It contains the phrase ""how about i die then,"" which is an explicit expression of a suicidal thought or a thought about one's own death, even if phrased rhetorically.
    It does not contain any specific plan, method, or mention of preparations for suicide.
    It does not describe a past attempt.

    Based on the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide."" The phrase ""how about i die then"" is an explicit thought about dying, going beyond a ""vague feeling"" and directly mentioning ""die"" in relation to the self. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the thought is explicitly about the poster's death.
    *   **Ideation:** ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""how about i die then"" fits this definition as an explicit expression of a suicidal thought. There is no plan mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** Requires a plan or method, which is absent.
    *   **Attempt:** Requires description of a past attempt, which is absent.

    The phrase ""how about i die then"" is a clear articulation of a suicidal thought. It's more than general dissatisfaction or hopelessness; it's a specific contemplation of death related to the self. Therefore, it falls into 'Ideation'. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" is considered, but ""how about I die then"" is a fairly explicit thought about dying, which aligns with ""suicidal thoughts or feelings"" in the Ideation definition, even if the word ""suicide"" itself isn't used. The expression is not vague regarding the topic of the poster's death.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No current signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This applies, as there's no current plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""6 month ago"") and strong current/ongoing intentions (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? It describes a past ""opportunity"" to die by suicide from which the person ""talked myself down."" The definition of 'Attempt' requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" ""Talking myself down"" is an action of stopping, not an action of attempting. So, this past event, while a severe crisis, may not fit the strict definition of a past *attempt* (like a failed overdose).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and expresses a clear, ongoing desire to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a current specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   The critical point is whether the past event (""had the perfect opportunity... talked myself down"") qualifies as an 'Attempt' under the provided definition: ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" ""Talking myself down"" from an ""opportunity"" implies they were at the brink, possibly with means, but did not carry out the suicidal act. It's more than ""merely thought,"" but it's not a ""concrete action"" *of attempting* in the sense of an overdose or other self-harming act that was initiated. It was an aborted act.
    *   Given the very strong current expressions of wanting to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"") without a specific plan, and the past event not clearly meeting the ""concrete action"" criterion for 'Attempt', the post best fits 'Ideation'. The focus is on the current, explicit desire to die.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses feelings of weakness (""I'm too weak"", ""showing how weak I am""), being hurt (""hurt me severely""), embarrassment (""embarrassing myself""), feeling pathetic (""I'm pathetic""), and a sense of hopelessness about the specific social situation (""I know it's never gonna happen""). There's general dissatisfaction and distress related to friendships and relationships.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.
2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a desire for ""things to be normal"" and to ""have someone to be friends with,"" not a desire to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that suicide is not mentioned.
3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there's no ideation.
4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current emotional distress and an ongoing social situation. There are no stated intentions related to suicide.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5.  CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post expresses significant emotional distress, feelings of weakness, and hopelessness regarding a social situation. However, there are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, plans, or past attempts. The definition of ""Indicator"" states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits the ""Indicator"" category as it shows general distress and hopelessness in a specific context without any mention of suicide.

35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working..."" - ""kill myself"" is used, but explicitly stated as metaphorical in the context of hard work. The ""unfortunately"" adds a layer of wishing it weren't just metaphorical or a wish for an end.
        *   ""I just want to not exist."" - This is a strong statement indicating a desire to cease being.
    *   **Emotional indicators:**
        *   ""I feel hollow.""
        *   ""I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day...""
        *   ""Never have I felt a lasting happiness.""
        *   Deep loneliness (""God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me... The only people like that exist in my head."")
        *   Pain (""It hurts. It hurts so bad."")
        *   Self-hatred (""God I fucking hate myself."")
        *   Hopelessness (""My only choice now is to suffer in silence..."")
        *   Desire for an escape (""I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land..."")
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. The ""kill myself working"" is explicitly metaphorical.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - The phrase ""kill myself"" is used, but qualified as ""metaphorically"". However, the statement ""I just want to not exist"" is a very strong indicator.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""I just want to not exist"" is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The desire ""to not exist"" is quite clear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. - No plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current feelings and intentions (""I just want to not exist"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing. The key phrase for classification is ""I just want to not exist.""
    According to the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide."" ""I just want to not exist"" is more than a vague feeling and is an explicit expression of wanting to not be alive.
    *   **Ideation:** ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I just want to not exist"" directly fits ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" No plan is mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** Requires a plan or method, which is absent.
    *   **Attempt:** Refers to past actions, which are not described.

    The statement ""I just want to not exist"" is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'. While ""kill myself"" was used metaphorically, the desire to not exist is direct and central to the post's suicidal sentiment.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to end it"", ""put a bullet right through it"", ""take my own life"", ""want to die"" (repeatedly).
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""losing my mind"", ""complete breakdown"", ""hate myself"", ""hate my brain"", ""can't take it anymore"", ""tired of being alone"", ""tired of feeling worthless"", ""tired of failing"", ""don't want to be here anymore"". Strong expressions of despair, self-hatred, and hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""put a bullet right through it"" is a specific method involving a firearm.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""take my own life"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""want to end it"", ""i dont want to be here anymore"", ""i just want to die"" - repeated multiple times).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""put a bullet right through it"" (implies a gun and a specific action).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring a weapon, writing a note). However, the mention of a specific method is present. The phrase ""i dont have the balls to take my own life"" suggests a lack of immediate action or capability, but the thought of a specific method is clearly articulated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I just want to end it"", ""i just want to put a bullet right through it"", ""i dont want to be here anymore"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""take my own life"") and strong expressions of wanting to die (""want to end it"", ""want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post also includes a specific method: ""put a bullet right through it"".
    *   The definition of **Ideation** states ""...without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   The definition of **Behavior** states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... tools/weapons (e.g. ...guns...)).""
    *   The phrase ""put a bullet right through it"" is a mention of a specific method involving a tool/weapon (a gun, implied by ""bullet"").
    *   While the user states ""i dont have the balls to take my own life"", which might indicate a lower likelihood of immediate action, the *content of the post* includes both explicit suicidal thoughts and the mention of a specific method. The definition of 'Behavior' focuses on the *mention* of a method.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'Behavior' category because it combines explicit suicidal ideation with the mention of a specific method. The ""unsure about explicit plan"" rule would lead to 'Ideation', but here a specific *method* is mentioned, which falls under the ""explicit planning like a specific method"" part of the 'Behavior' definition.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep"" is mentioned as a potential method and timing.
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit mention of a past attempt having occurred.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide watch"", ""end it"" in the context of dying).
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""better if i was dead"", ""god i wish i could just fucking end it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""take a bunch of pills"". This is a specific method involving lethal medication.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly stated that preparations have been made (e.g., ""I have the pills""), but a method and potential timing (""while everyones asleep"") are considered. The definition of 'behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... like a specific method"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""i could take a bunch of pills"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
    *   The post goes beyond 'ideation' because it mentions a specific method (""take a bunch of pills""). The definition of 'ideation' states ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"". The definition of 'behavior' states ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method... (e.g. lethal medication/drugs...)"". ""Take a bunch of pills"" qualifies as a specific method involving lethal medication. Even though the person expresses fear and ambivalence, the mention of a specific method is present.
    *   The post is not 'attempt' as it does not describe a past attempt.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'behavior' category due to the explicit suicidal thoughts combined with the mention of a specific method.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for the poster):**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for the poster's past attempt are detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? For the past attempt, having a ""plan"" implies preparation, but no current preparation is indicated.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""kermit sewer slide thoughts"" is a known internet euphemism for suicidal thoughts. The post states, ""I still get the 'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts. And it's tempting a lot of the time.""

    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts using the euphemism ""kermit sewer slide thoughts."" The user also states these thoughts are ""tempting."" This fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    It is not 'Indicator' because suicide (via a direct euphemism) is mentioned.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""jump in front of a train"" is mentioned as a specific method. Also mentions ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"", which indicates some thought about the aftermath, even if framed as a barrier.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""want to kill myself"", ""if I did kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""shouldn't exist"", ""hate being alive"", ""wish I was never born"", ""want to kill myself so badly"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump in front of a train"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The mention of ""how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" suggests consideration of practical aspects, which can be a form of pre-planning thought, even if expressed as a difficulty. The primary indicator of a plan is the specific method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I wish I had the guts to jump..."", ""It's looking pretty good..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post includes a specific method (""jump in front of a train""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method..."" The mention of ""jump in front of a train"" fits this criterion as a specific method.
    *   There are no past attempts described, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    Therefore, the category is 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""dead"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""Fuck me"" (repeatedly, indicating extreme distress/anger/frustration), ""i cant breathe"" (panic, overwhelming emotion), ""im useless"" (low self-worth, hopelessness), ""everyone would he better off with me dead"" (hopelessness, feeling like a burden).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""kill myself"", ""everyone would he better off with me dead""). This clearly indicates suicidal thoughts. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. It is not describing a past attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thought about slitting my wrists"" is a clear mention of a self-harm/suicidal act and method.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" ""feeling more alone."" These indicate significant distress.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method. The post states ""i didnt do it,"" indicating no action or preparation was completed.
    *   References to past attempts: No, it says ""i thought about... but i didnt do it,"" which is a thought, not an action taken.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""slitting my wrists"" is an explicit description of a suicidal act.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""thought about slitting my wrists"" is a direct expression of considering a suicidal act, which implies a desire to die or end suffering.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - Yes, ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No, the post says ""i didnt do it.""
    *   The Ideation definition includes a crucial rule: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" This post contains a specific method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - ""thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it"" refers to a recent thought (today) that was not acted upon. The emotional state (""growing more depressed"") is current.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No, it was a thought, not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not 'Indicator' because ""slitting my wrists"" is an explicit reference to a suicidal act/method, going beyond general distress.
    *   The post is not 'Attempt' because it explicitly states ""but i didnt do it.""
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide... If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""

    *   The post contains an explicit suicidal thought (""thought about slitting my wrists"") and a specific method (""slitting my wrists"").
    *   The rule within the 'Ideation' definition (""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'"") directly applies here. The mention of ""slitting my wrists"" as the content of the thought means it contains a specific idea of how to commit suicide.
    *   This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, as ""thought about slitting my wrists"" can be seen as ""explicit planning like a specific method"" being contemplated, even if not acted upon. The presence of a method in the thought is the key factor according to the provided definitions.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal feelings are coming back""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""ashamed"", ""depressed"", ""constant pain"", ""worried""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal feelings"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" implies feelings related to wanting to die or end one's life.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal feelings"". This is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i'm someone who wants to die"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The phrase ""wants to die"" is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive, making it quite clear.
3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is mentioned.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post contains the explicit statement ""i'm someone who wants to die"". This is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive. However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation to act on this desire. It is not a past attempt.
    - 'Indicator': The definition states ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" and ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Here, ""wants to die"" *is* an explicit expression of a suicidal thought/feeling.
    - 'Ideation': The definition states ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits perfectly with ""i'm someone who wants to die"" and the absence of a plan.
    - 'Behavior': Requires a plan or method, which is not present.
    - 'Attempt': Requires description of a past attempt, which is not present.

    The phrase ""wants to die"" is a clear expression of suicidal ideation.

    *   Emotional indicators: Expresses love for loved ones (""need my loved ones to know I love them so much""), determination (""My minds made up"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""suicide notes"" are a form of preparation. ""Leaving soon"" implies an imminent plan, though the method of suicide itself is not specified.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide notes"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm leaving soon"" in the context of ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"" clearly indicates an intent to die. ""My minds made up"" reinforces this.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon, location) for the act of suicide is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of writing or seeking help to write ""suicide notes"" is a significant preparation. The phrase ""I'm leaving soon"" also suggests a plan is in place.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm leaving soon"", ""need help on the goodbye letters"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
    *   The user expresses a clear intention to die (""I'm leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide date"", ""end thing v v soon"", ""didn't die last night"", ""sh/suicidality"" (self-harm/suicidality), ""constant attempts"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""worst of this hell"", ""fucking done"", ""don't trust anymore"", ""trauma/ptsd"", ""abused"", ""treat me like shit"". Strong indicators of hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"" (specific date is a plan). ""save some flowers for me please? I like lavender"" (can be seen as a preparation/final wish).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""8 yrs of constant attempts"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide date"", ""suicidality"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon) is mentioned for the *current* plan, but a specific *date* is set: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"". This constitutes a specific plan regarding timing.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, setting a specific date is a sign of preparation. The request ""save some flowers for me please? I like lavender"" also suggests preparation for death.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. It refers to past events (""8 yrs of constant attempts"") and current/future intentions (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""8 yrs of constant attempts"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die. It includes a specific plan (a date for suicide: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021""). This would qualify for 'Behavior'.
    However, the post also clearly states ""8 yrs of constant attempts"", indicating past attempts.
    The definition for **Attempt** states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... **Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.**""
    Since this post refers to past attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts"") AND mentions current plans (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date""), according to the provided rule, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. This specific rule for 'Attempt' takes precedence when both past attempts and current plans are present.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I want to disappear forever"" is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive. ""I want to be the missing pixel which burned out"" also implies this.
    *   The Ideation definition clarifies that ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" falls under it. The desire *is* explicitly expressed.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan is mentioned, it would not be 'behavior'.

    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses strong feelings of hopelessness (""Pointlessness"") and a clear, explicit desire to cease existing (""I want to disappear forever"").
    *   According to the **Indicator** definition, it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" However, it also states ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   According to the **Ideation** definition, it ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I want to disappear forever"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive. The Ideation definition also states: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Here, such a desire *is* expressed.
    *   The phrase ""I know I will die by 35"" further supports the presence of serious suicidal thoughts, even if the mechanism isn't stated.
    *   While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the desire ""to disappear forever"" is an explicit expression of wanting to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'. The rule about doubt (""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"") is considered, but ""I want to disappear forever"" is a fairly unambiguous expression of a desire to not be alive, which is the criterion for 'Ideation'.
    *   No plan or method is mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   No past attempt is described, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive, fulfilling the primary criterion for 'Ideation'.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""take them all"" (referring to pills) implies overdose, a method of suicide/self-harm. ""why i didnt take them all"" expresses regret for not having done so, implying a desire for death.
    *   Note emotional indicators: ""coward,"" ""living a life nobody loves or cares for me in"" indicates hopelessness, despair, loneliness, low self-worth.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""pills"" are mentioned as a means. ""take them all"" is a specific method (overdose). ""every night i count my pills"" indicates access to means and a recurring focus/behavior related to the method, which can be seen as a form of preparation or fixation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""why i didnt take them all"" refers to a past *inaction* or *decision not to act*, not a completed attempt that failed.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""every day i wonder why i didnt take them all"" (pills) is a strong expression of wishing they had died, implying a current or recurring desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills"" and the act of ""take them all"" (implying overdose).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""every night i count my pills"" shows access to the means and a recurring behavior centered on these means, which constitutes a form of preparation or fixation related to the method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""every night i count my pills"" and ""every day i wonder"" describe current, ongoing thoughts and behaviors. The phrase ""why i didnt take them all"" refers to a past point of *not* acting, but the wondering is current and indicates present ideation linked to that past inaction. It's not describing a past *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond 'Indicator' because there's a clear reference to a suicidal act (""take them all"" pills) and a desire for death.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because ""why i didnt take them all"" means the act was not carried out in the past.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts... but without any specific plan"".
        *   'Behavior': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
    *   The post includes:
        1.  Explicit suicidal thoughts: ""wonder why i didnt take them all"".
        2.  Specific method: ""pills,"" ""take them all"".
        3.  Preparations/related behavior: ""every night i count my pills"".
    *   The mention of a specific method (""pills,"" ""take them all"") and the recurring behavior of ""counting my pills"" (access and focus on means) in conjunction with the suicidal thoughts (""wonder why I didn't take them all"") fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The ""plan"" of overdosing on pills is clearly implied and referenced. The criteria for Behavior states it ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Both are present.

51,The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately. Idk why but in the past few months my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral. Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me. I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again. I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" ""dying,"" or ""self-harm."" The post mentions ""thoughts"" that are ""unbearably strong"" and a ""major downward spiral.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""unbearably strong,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""struggle,"" ""don't know what to do."" These indicate significant distress and hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""don't want to end up in the psych ward again"" implies a history of severe mental health crisis requiring hospitalization, but it does not explicitly state a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not directly. The post describes ""unbearably strong thoughts"" and a ""major downward spiral,"" which are highly concerning, but it doesn't explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to be alive."" The nature of ""the thoughts"" is not explicitly defined as suicidal.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Given the lack of explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die, this step leans towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   This step is not fully applicable as 'ideation' has not been clearly established.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings (""lately,"" ""past few months,"" ""Everyday"") and a fear of a future recurrence of a past situation (""end up in the psych ward again"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Being in a ""psych ward"" is not synonymous with a suicide attempt, although it can be related. The post does not provide details of why the person was in the psych ward previously.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness (""don't know what to do""), and a severe struggle (""unbearably strong thoughts,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""making it through the day is such a struggle"").
    However, the definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    The definition of 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    In this post, ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself"" is not mentioned. While ""the thoughts"" are ""unbearably strong"" and there's a ""downward spiral,"" the content of these thoughts is not explicitly stated as being suicidal or a desire to die. The reference to the ""psych ward again"" indicates the severity of past and potentially current mental state, but doesn't make the current post an explicit expression of suicidal ideation.
    Given the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when the explicit mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts is doubtful or absent, and the fact that the thoughts are not explicitly defined as suicidal, the post fits the 'Indicator' category. The post describes severe distress and hopelessness without explicitly mentioning suicide or a desire to die.

I know it sounds so stupid to want to die over not having a boyfriend but it's seriously affecting my mental health.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post includes ""I don't wanna do this anymore"", ""lost all will to live"", and ""want to die"". These are direct references to not wanting to live and wanting death.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong emotional distress is evident: ""I cant do this anymore"", ""feel empty, alone, and uncared for"", ""lost all will to live"", ""seriously affecting my mental health"". Hopelessness regarding finding love and a general will to live.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. ""I don't wanna do this anymore"", ""lost all will to live"", and ""want to die"" are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrase ""want to die"" is a very direct expression of a suicidal feeling/thought. The definition of Ideation includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". This is clearly present. The Ideation definition also states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Since a desire to die *is* expressed, it points away from Indicator.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': This rule is not directly needed here as there's no mention of a plan, so it wouldn't be Behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I cant do this anymore"", ""want to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""want to die"") and not wanting to live (""lost all will to live""). This aligns with the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   It is not **Indicator** because Indicator ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and is for ""general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" ""Want to die"" is a direct indication of suicidal thoughts. The Ideation definition's clause ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" reinforces this; here, a desire to die *is* expressed.
    *   It is not **Behavior** because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    *   It is not **Attempt** because it describes current feelings, not a past action of attempting suicide.

    The phrases ""want to die"" and ""lost all will to live"" are considered explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive, fitting the 'Ideation' category.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""mentally ill"", ""can't afford treatment"", ""can't hold work"", ""need help"", ""don't have energy"", ""health is shit"", ""what's the fucking point"", ""fed up of all this bullshit"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post describes the *reason* for wanting to die (""fed up of all this bullshit"") but not *how* it would be done.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""killing myself"").
    *   It expresses a desire to die or a strong feeling that this will be the outcome.
    *   There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    *   It is not describing a past attempt.
    *   It is more than 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned.
    *   It is not 'attempt' because it refers to a future possibility, not a past action.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the phrase ""tried to kms yesterday"" describes a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I absolutely cannot fight anymore,"" ""non stop pain and suffering,"" ""I cant. Please. I cant live anymore."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and exhaustion.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions seeking ""a non painful way to do this,"" which implies looking for a method, but no specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): The word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""a non painful way to do this"" in the context of ""I cant live anymore"" is a very strong and clear reference to the act of ending one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""I cant live anymore."" This is a direct expression.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrase ""I cant live anymore"" is an explicit expression of wanting to not be alive, which is a core component of 'Ideation'. The phrase ""a non painful way to do this"" clearly refers to the act of suicide in this context.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No. The person is looking for a ""non painful way"" but does not specify any method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" strongly implies a desire for life to end, although it doesn't use the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness. The key phrase is ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue.""
    According to the definition of **Indicator**: ""...lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide...May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide...Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    According to the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan...""

    The phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon"" is an explicit expression of a desire for life to end. It's more than a ""vague feeling about dying"" and goes beyond ""general dissatisfaction."" It directly states a readiness for life to be ""over with."" This aligns with the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" part of the 'Ideation' definition.
    Even though the word ""suicide"" itself is not used, the intent expressed (""ready to get this over with soon"") is an explicit expression of wanting to die. The definition of 'Ideation' clarifies that ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, *i.e.* a desire to not be alive any longer"" qualifies. The phrase in the post is a clear example of this desire.
    There is no plan or method mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    There is no mention of past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation'.

    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have overdosed"", ""I took 500mg Zoloft"". This is a specific method (overdose) and substance (Zoloft with dosage).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The post describes an action that has just occurred: ""I finally went through. I have overdosed."" This is presented as a completed action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" This is complex. While stating ""I don't want to die,"" the context of an overdose suggests a severe crisis. The act of overdosing itself is a strong indicator, regardless of the stated immediate desire concerning death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdosed"" and ""took 500mg Zoloft"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of taking the Zoloft implies preparation (obtaining and ingesting it).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to an event that has just happened: ""I finally went through. I have overdosed."" ""It hasn't been that long"". This is a description of a very recent past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states, ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft."" This describes a concrete action that has already taken place.
    The definition of **Attempt** is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    The action described (""I have overdosed"") fits the example (""e.g. overdose"") and the criteria of a ""concrete action"" that ""need to have happened in the past"" (even if very recent past).
    While the person states ""it won't kill me"" and ""I don't want to die,"" the act of overdosing itself is classified as an attempt, especially as per the category definition provided. The regret or current feelings about the outcome don't negate the action itself.
    It is not 'Indicator' because there's a clear description of a self-harming act (overdose).
    It is not 'Ideation' because an action has been taken, not just thoughts expressed.
    It is not 'Behavior' because 'Behavior' focuses on *plans* for suicide or ongoing self-harm that isn't framed as a completed attempt. This post describes a completed act of overdose. The phrasing ""I have overdosed"" points to a past event.
    Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate category.

60,"I'm doing it in the near future. I feel so at peace right now, knowing I'm going to. I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go. I'm ready.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrases ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" and ""I'm ready to go"" are strong euphemisms for suicide, indicating an intention to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""at peace,"" ""ready."" In the context of impending suicide, ""at peace"" can signify a resolved decision.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (tools, location, substances) is mentioned. ""Near future"" is a timeframe, but not a specific plan. ""Spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend"" could be interpreted as a form of saying goodbye or settling affairs, but it's not an explicit preparation like acquiring means or writing a note as per the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used. However, the phrases ""I'm doing it"" and ""ready to go"" in this context are very direct and explicit expressions of an intent to die by suicide.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" and ""I'm ready to go"" are direct expressions of a decision and intention to end one's life, which constitutes an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive any longer.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** The intent here seems quite clear and explicit, not vague. The post expresses a resolved decision to die. The 'Ideation' definition covers ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This post fits that criterion.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No. There is no mention of tools, locations, substances, or any specific way the person intends to die.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** ""Spent some good time with my favourite person"" could be seen as a preparatory action (e.g., saying goodbyes). However, the 'Behavior' definition specifies ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)."" Spending time with someone, while potentially significant, does not meet this definition of explicit preparation of means or method.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** Given the lack of a specific method and the ambiguity of ""spending time with someone"" as an ""explicit plan"" according to the provided examples for 'Behavior', 'Ideation' is more appropriate.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It clearly refers to current and future intentions (""in the near future,"" ""I'm going to,"" ""I'm ready"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** The post goes beyond ""general expressions of distress"" or ""vague feeling about dying."" The expressions ""I'm doing it"" and ""ready to go"" are explicit about the intention to die, even if the word ""suicide"" isn't used. The 'Indicator' definition states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" This post *does* have explicit expressions concerning the act of suicide.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (evidenced by ""I'm doing it,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" ""I'm ready to go""). It lacks a ""specific plan to commit suicide"" as no method or explicit preparation of means is mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** While there's a strong intent and a timeframe (""near future""), there's no mention of a specific method or explicit preparation as defined by the 'Behavior' category (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note, specific location).
    *   **Attempt:** The post refers to future intentions, not past actions.

The post clearly expresses a decision and intent to die soon. This is an explicit expression of suicidal feelings/intent. However, no specific method or concrete plan (as defined for 'Behavior') is mentioned. Therefore, it falls into 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" (""when my old high school found out i was suicidal"").
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses frustration and annoyance about a past event (""like what the hell…""). It doesn't express current hopelessness or despair related to suicide.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The post states the user ""was suicidal"" in the past. This indicates a past suicidal state or ideation but does not explicitly describe a concrete *attempt* (e.g., an action taken).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""I was suicidal"" is a direct expression of having had suicidal thoughts/feelings in the past.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The context is historical, and no plan is mentioned even for the past, beyond the state of being ""suicidal"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post explicitly refers to a past event (""it was 4 yrs ago"", ""when my old high school found out i was suicidal""). There are no indications of current suicidal intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The post describes a past state of being ""suicidal,"" which is a state of mind or ideation. It does not describe a concrete action taken as an attempt. The definition of 'Attempt' requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"". Being ""found out"" as suicidal does not inherently mean an attempt occurred; it could mean ideation was disclosed or discovered.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" so it is not 'Indicator' (which ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"").
    *   There is no mention of current plans or self-harming behavior, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   The post describes a past state of being ""suicidal."" This is past ideation. It does not describe a ""concrete action"" of an attempt in the past. For example, the school could have found out through expressed thoughts, writings, or other signs of ideation, not necessarily a physical attempt. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
    *   The category 'Ideation' is defined as ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings..."". The post ""I was suicidal"" is an explicit expression of (past) suicidal thoughts or feelings. While the ideation was in the past, the definition of 'Ideation' does not strictly limit it to *current* thoughts, but rather that the *content includes explicit expressions* of such thoughts. Given that it's not an 'Indicator' (due to explicit mention) and not an 'Attempt' (no concrete action), 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category for a post describing past suicidal thoughts/feelings that don't constitute a described attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i should die"", ""kill myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""trash"", ""rubbish sucking at everything"", ""hate my family"", ""no friends"", ""so sensitive"", ""suffer"". Strong feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, anger, and isolation are present.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything."" This indicates preparation.
    *   References to past attempts: None. The statement ""I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days"" refers to a decision and preparation, not a past completed attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""kill myself"").

    *   The phrase ""I have prepared everything"" directly refers to ""preparations taken,"" even if the specific details of those preparations are not provided.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""rope"" is mentioned, although the person states they have not acquired it. The act of ""doing it"" (suicide) is planned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes.
        *   Choosing a specific location: ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it"".
        *   Planning details for the chosen location: ""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police"".
        *   Deciding against another location: ""i wont do it at home"".
    These constitute explicit planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The suicidal thoughts are long-standing, but the specific plans (""decided the woodland"", ""how i will leave notes"") refer to current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Past self-harm as a child is mentioned, but not as a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   The post includes more than just ideation. There are specific plans:
        *   A chosen location (""the woodland"").
        *   Preparatory actions (planning to leave notes, deciding not to do it at home).
        *   Mention of a method (""rope""), even if not yet acquired.
    *   These elements align with the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations..."" The planning here (location, notes) is explicit.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past suicide attempt is described.

The presence of a specific chosen location (""the woodland"") and planned actions related to the suicide (leaving notes) constitutes explicit planning, fitting the 'Behavior' category.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore .

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I wanna off myself"", ""I don't even wanna live anymore"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I hate my life"", ""sick and tired"", ""complete bullshit"", ""fucking hate my mom"". Strong expressions of frustration, anger, and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:** Based on the above analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I wanna off myself"", ""I don't even wanna live anymore"") but does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation. It is not describing a past attempt. Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night"", ""stay alive"", ""when I'm gone"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""desperate to get help"", ""hopeless"", ""No one in my life cares"", ""I have no one to talk to"", ""No one in my life will miss me"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""tonight's the night"" implies a decision and a timeframe, but no specific method or preparation is mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None explicitly stated. The post mentions calling a hotline, but not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""tonight's the night I guess"", ""when I'm gone"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. While ""tonight's the night"" indicates a decision and imminence, no specific method (e.g., pills, weapon, location) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations (like writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The phrase ""tonight's the night"" is a strong indicator of intent but does not detail a plan or method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""tonight's the night"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions being ""suicidal"" and expresses a desire to die (""tonight's the night"", ""when I'm gone""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is ruled out.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Behavior' requires an explicit plan or method. While ""tonight's the night"" is very concerning and suggests a decision has been made, it does not specify *how* the person intends to end their life. No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned. According to the definition: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Since no explicit plan or method is stated, 'Ideation' is the more appropriate category. The post expresses strong suicidal thoughts and a general timeframe, but lacks the specific details of a plan required for 'Behavior'.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""cutting an artery"" is a clear reference to a severe self-harm method with high potential for lethality. ""oxy"" (Oxycodone) is a potent painkiller, often associated with overdose or, in this context, potentially to manage pain during a self-harm act. The combination strongly suggests suicidal intent.
    *   Emotional indicators: The phrase ""im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask"" suggests distress and a feeling of isolation, possibly seeking validation or information for a desperate act.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly mentions a combination of methods: ""oxy and cutting an artery."" The question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" indicates consideration of the logistics and details of this plan.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (the word ""suicide"")? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want to die"")? No, not in those exact words.
    *   However, the discussion of specific, lethal methods like ""cutting an artery"" combined with ""oxy"" to mitigate pain is a very strong implicit expression of suicidal thoughts. The definition of ""Indicator"" states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" ""Cutting an artery"" is an explicit expression *concerning* suicide (as a method).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""oxy"" (a lethal drug/medication) and ""cutting an artery"" (a specific, lethal method implying a tool).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The question itself is about the preparation/execution of the plan (how to make it less painful), which constitutes a form of planning.
    *   The rule ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" does not apply here as the planning (""oxy and cutting an artery"") is explicit.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The question implies current consideration or future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt**: Not applicable as there's no description of a past attempt.
    *   **Ideation**: This category is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts... but without any specific plan."" This post *does* contain a specific plan (""oxy and cutting an artery""). Therefore, it cannot be Ideation.
    *   **Indicator**: This category ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and may involve ""vague feeling about dying or death."" The mention of ""cutting an artery"" and ""oxy"" is a very specific and explicit expression *concerning* suicide (as a method), not vague. Therefore, it is not Indicator.
    *   **Behavior**: This category includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons...).""
        *   The post mentions a specific plan: ""oxy and cutting an artery.""
        *   ""oxy"" fits ""lethal medication/drugs.""
        *   ""cutting an artery"" fits ""specific method"" and implies ""tools/weapons.""
        *   While the post doesn't say ""I want to die,"" the act of detailing and asking for logistical advice on a lethal suicide plan (""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"") is a strong manifestation of suicidal thoughts being expressed through the discussion of the behavior itself. The focus on the plan and means aligns directly with the definition and examples provided for ""Behavior."" The planning is explicit.

    Given the explicit mention of a plan involving specific methods (drugs and a lethal action), ""Behavior"" is the most appropriate category. The query about pain reduction is part of the planning/preparation for the act.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""die,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""commit suicide."" These terms are used when the poster recounts what their friend said (""she's positive I'm going to kill myself,"" ""scared that I am going to commit suicide"").
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The poster expresses being ""hurt,"" that the friend's words ""played on my mind,"" ""it's not sitting well with me,"" ""Her words have really hurt me,"" ""It's so thoughtless and hurtful,"" ""It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her."" The poster also mentions ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"" (BPD and CPTSD). This indicates distress and a struggle, but also an effort to cope.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned by the poster for themselves.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None are mentioned by the poster for themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, terms like ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" are used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive *from the poster*? No. The poster is quoting or referring to what their friend said or might fear. The poster's own statements are about being hurt by these comments and trying to fight their mental illness (""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness""). They are seeking advice on how to handle the friend's comment.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The mentions of suicide are explicit in the text, but they are not expressions of the *poster's own current suicidal desire or intent*. They are reports of what a friend said. The poster is expressing distress *about* these comments.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as ideation from the poster is not established.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The friend's comment was ""a couple of weeks ago."" The poster's distress and the dilemma about interacting with the friend are current. There are no expressions of current or future suicidal intentions from the poster.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    The post revolves around suicide as a topic because of the friend's comments. However, the crucial point is whether the *poster* is expressing suicidal thoughts or intent.
    The poster is clearly distressed (""hurt,"" ""upset,"" ""not sitting well with me"") by the friend's statement. They mention their mental illness (BPD, CPTSD) and state, ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness."" This statement is contrary to expressing a desire to die.
    The post does not contain any expressions from the poster like ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" or ""I'm thinking about suicide."" The focus is on the emotional impact of the friend's words and seeking advice on the interpersonal conflict.
    According to the ""Indicator"" definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide [from the poster themselves regarding their own suicidal feelings/thoughts]. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings [from the poster]."" While suicide is *mentioned*, it's not an explicit expression of the *poster's own* suicidal thoughts. The poster is expressing distress related to the topic.
    The rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"" is key. The friend's statements about suicide do not automatically mean the poster is suicidal.
    The definition of ""Ideation"" requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The poster does not make such expressions.
    Therefore, the post shows general distress and discusses suicide as a topic raised by a third party, but the poster does not express personal suicidal ideation. This fits the ""Indicator"" category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""jump out"" (implies potential death/serious harm from jumping out a window), ""cut the screen"" (preparation for jumping, could also be seen as a preparatory act or minor self-harm in itself, but primarily linked to the jumping).
    *   Note emotional indicators: ""please please please help me"", ""i dont know what to do"" (extreme distress, helplessness, desperation).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""at my window right now"", ""with scissors"", ""cut the screen and jump out"". This clearly indicates a location (window), a tool (scissors), and a method (cutting the screen to jump).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""jump out"" (of a window) is a direct expression of an intent to perform an action that is highly likely to result in death or serious injury, thus strongly implying a desire to die or escape a situation through a life-threatening act. The phrase ""i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out"" expresses an imminent suicidal action.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump out"" (of the window).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""at my window right now with scissors"", ""cut the screen"". This shows current location, possession of a tool for the purpose, and an intended immediate action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and immediate future intentions (""right now"", ""about to"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses extreme distress and an immediate intent to perform a life-threatening action.
    While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""jump out"" of a window is a clear suicidal act. The expression ""i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out"" is an explicit expression of an impending suicidal action.
    The post includes:
    -   An explicit expression of an imminent suicidal act (""about to cut the screen and jump out"").
    -   A specific plan/method (""jump out"" of the window).
    -   Specific preparations/means (""at my window right now with scissors"", ""cut the screen"").
    This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken..."" The user is describing an imminent action with a clear method and means.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""pain everyday"", ""don't wanna deal with it"", ""i'm sorry"" (suggests despair, hopelessness, giving up).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""overdose on iron pills"" is a specific method and substance. The phrase ""i'm gonna"" indicates intent.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""overdose on iron pills"" is a clear indication of suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""don't wanna deal with it"" in conjunction with the plan to overdose strongly implies a desire to not be alive.
    *   The instruction says ""If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'"". However, ""overdose"" is a very strong indicator of self-harm with lethal intent. The combination of ""overdose"" and ""iron pills"" makes the intent clear.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose on iron pills"". This is a specific method and a specific substance.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""i'm gonna"" suggests a decision has been made and implies an intention to act. While it doesn't explicitly state pills have been acquired, the specificity of ""iron pills"" is a strong indicator of a plan.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method... lethal medication/drugs"". ""Overdose on iron pills"" fits this.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""i'm gonna"" clearly refers to current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post contains an explicit method (""overdose on iron pills"").
    *   It expresses a desire to end suffering (""don't wanna deal with it"") coupled with a lethal method.
    *   This goes beyond 'Ideation' because a specific method is named.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because it refers to a future action (""i'm gonna"").
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because the intent and method are too specific.
    *   The definition for 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs...)."" ""Overdose on iron pills"" clearly falls under ""specific method"" and ""lethal medication/drugs"".

        *   ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me"" - desire for death.
        *   ""assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people"" - mentions suicide.
        *   ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night"" - desire for death linked to a behavior.
        *   ""to just end it all"" - desire for death.
        *   ""cowardice with killing myself"" - mentions suicide.
        *   ""how much I want to die"" - explicit desire for death.
        *   ""unfit to be alive"" - strong negative self-perception related to life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong hopelessness (""losing more hope""), despair (""hate being alive,"" ""prolonging my suffering""), sadness (""crying myself to sleep""), worthlessness (""useless I am,"" ""defective"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions a recurring behavior: ""I walk through sketchy areas every night"" with the explicit hope and intent ""for me to get murdered."" This is a specific action taken to increase the likelihood of death, even if the desired agent of death is external.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""kill myself,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""killing myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes (numerous, e.g., ""Hoping to be murdered,"" ""I hate being alive,"" ""I want to die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The ""method"" is to be murdered. The ""plan"" or behavior to achieve this is ""walk through sketchy areas every night."" This is a specific action.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of repeatedly going to sketchy areas is a form of preparation or enactment of this plan.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" or ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide."" While the person states an inability to ""kill myself,"" the act of deliberately and repeatedly putting oneself in life-threatening situations (""walk through sketchy areas every night"") with the express desire to be killed (""I wish so badly for me to get murdered"") constitutes a self-destructive behavior and a plan to end life.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current and ongoing (""every night,"" ""every single day"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes current desires/behaviors, not past actions.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:**
        *   'Ideation' is for thoughts/desires ""without any specific plan.""
        *   'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide OR exhibits self-harming behavior.""
        *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts. It also describes a specific, repeated action (""walk through sketchy areas every night"") undertaken with the intent to die (""to get murdered""). This action is a self-destructive behavior and constitutes a plan to achieve death, even if the desired mechanism is external. This goes beyond merely thinking about it; it's an enacted behavior. The phrase ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" in the 'Behavior' definition covers this scenario of actively seeking out lethal danger.

Take care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""going to die,"" ""experience it painfully,"" ""going to leave"" (euphemism for dying/suicide in this context), ""can't take no more,"" ""See you all on the other side.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""glad I'm going to die,"" ""felt unwanted,"" ""can't take no more,"" strong sense of hopelessness and finality.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon, location) is mentioned. ""Going to leave"" and ""see you on the other side"" imply an impending action but not *how*.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die,"" ""I'm going to leave,"" ""can't take no more,"" ""See you all on the other side."" These are strong expressions of wanting life to end.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the intent and desire to die are very explicit.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. No tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post itself acts like a farewell note (""See you all on the other side. Take care.""), which could be seen as a preparation, but no *means* are mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific method is mentioned, it leans towards ideation.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""I'm going to die,"" ""I'm going to leave.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post expresses a very clear and explicit desire to die (""glad I'm going to die"") and an intention to act on it (""going to leave,"" ""see you all on the other side""). This goes beyond 'Indicator' because the desire to die is explicit. It does not qualify for 'Behavior' because no specific plan or method is mentioned (e.g., how they plan to die). It is not 'Attempt' as it refers to current/future intentions, not a past action. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category, as it covers explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just don't wanna be here"", ""I don't think I can do it anymore"", ""starting to want to wave the white flag"" (metaphor for giving up on life). No explicit use of the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""tired of only feeling sadness and anxiety"", ""depression and anxiety"", ""tired of being a burden"", ""soul is hurting"", ""happiness... out of my reach for beyond a decade"" (implies hopelessness).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No (the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used).
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just don't wanna be here"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""I don't think I can do it anymore"" in this context also strongly suggests giving up on life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrase ""I just don't wanna be here"" is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This is not applicable as no plan is hinted at.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I just don't wanna be here"", ""I don't think I can do it anymore"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong expressions like ""I just don't wanna be here"" and ""I don't think I can do it anymore."" These indicate a desire to not be alive.
    *   The definition of **Indicator** states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" Phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here"" are considered direct indications of suicidal thoughts/feelings, even if the word ""suicide"" isn't used.
    *   The definition of **Ideation** states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post well. ""I just don't wanna be here"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it is not **Behavior**.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not **Attempt**.
    *   The phrases used go beyond general distress or vague feelings about death; they express a clear desire to cease living. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""suicidal like me some time ago"" - The poster states they were suicidal in the past.
        *   ""I really wish I could somehow donate my life"" - This implies a wish to die, albeit framed as a sacrifice.
        *   ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" - Direct expression of not wanting to be alive.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):
        *   Strong feelings of worthlessness (""I don't deserve... to live"").
        *   Desire to end own life (""nor want to live"", ""donate my life"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned by the poster. ""Donate my life"" is a wish, not a practical plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts:
        *   ""suicidal like me some time ago."" This indicates past suicidality. However, the term ""suicidal"" is general and does not explicitly describe a ""concrete action"" that constitutes an attempt as per the definition (e.g., an overdose). It could refer to past ideation or feelings without a specific attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the poster refers to themselves as having been ""suicidal... some time ago.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and the wish to ""donate my life.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
        *   Past: ""suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to the poster's past state.
        *   Current/Future: ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and ""I really wish I could somehow donate my life"" express current feelings and desires about not wanting to live.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. ""Suicidal like me some time ago"" does not describe a concrete action that would qualify as a past attempt according to the provided definition (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past... When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit current expressions of wanting to die (""I don't deserve, nor want to live""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no specific plan or method mentioned for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   The reference to being ""suicidal... some time ago"" is not specific enough to be classified as a past 'Attempt' because it doesn't describe a ""concrete action."" It could have been past ideation.
    *   The current statements (""I don't deserve, nor want to live"") are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings (a desire to not be alive) without a specific plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   The rule for 'Attempt' states ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" The phrase ""suicidal... some time ago"" could fall under this or general past ideation.
    *   Given the strong current desire to die without a plan, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm ready to die"", ""Hope it all ends soon"", ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"". No explicit mention of the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""tired of it"", ""tired of working on healing because it's a fucking joke"", ""Family is a fucking joke"", ""waste of time and energy"". Strong expressions of hopelessness, frustration, and giving up.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" This is a specific action and preparation. ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" is presented as a method to hasten death. ""I'm quitting therapy"" is another preparatory step of disengaging from support.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes: ""I'm ready to die"", ""Hope it all ends soon"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The desire to die is quite direct here, so it leans towards ideation or higher.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. Stopping all medications (""antidepressants, anti anxiety, blood pressure meds"") is a specific action that can be life-threatening, especially blood pressure medication. Consuming ""Soda and junk"" is also mentioned as a way to ""kill me faster"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes: ""I'm stopping all my meds *today*."" This indicates an immediate action being taken. Quitting therapy is also a preparation.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The plan here involves stopping prescribed medications and engaging in self-destructive eating habits with the stated aim of dying. Stopping critical medication is a concrete plan and method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and immediate future intentions: ""I'm stopping all my meds *today*"", ""Hope it all ends *soon*"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to die"", ""Hope it all ends soon""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   The post includes specific actions stated as beginning ""today"" (""I'm stopping all my meds today"") which are presented as means to an end (""kill me faster"", ""hope it all ends soon""). Stopping essential medications like blood pressure medication, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety medication is a significant step and can be considered a method or preparation for self-harm or suicide. The phrase ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" also indicates a method.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs... suitable to end ones life...).""
    *   Stopping prescribed, potentially life-sustaining or critical medications, with the intent for it to contribute to death, fits the criteria for a plan and method. This is not just a vague thought but a declared action.

Therefore, the post describes suicidal thoughts (""ready to die"") and a plan/method (stopping all medications today, consuming junk food to die faster).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""disappear"" and ""soul to be free from all this pain."" ""Disappear"" in this context strongly implies a desire for death or ceasing to exist. ""Soul to be free from pain"" also points towards death as a release. There is no explicit mention of the word ""suicide"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post clearly indicates significant emotional distress, pain, and a desire to escape this pain, suggesting feelings of hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: There are no references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" or phrases like ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. ""I just want to disappear"" and ""I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive or to cease existing.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expression ""I just want to disappear"" in the context of extreme pain is a clear expression of wanting to not be alive. While ""suicide"" isn't named, the desire is explicit.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is mentioned, it would not be 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current feelings and desires (""I just want..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to not be alive (""I just want to disappear,"" ""soul to be free from all this pain""). This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    It is not 'Indicator' because the desire to not be alive is explicitly expressed, going beyond ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" or ""vague feeling about dying."" The 'Indicator' definition states ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" Here, there is a direct indication.
    It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    It is not 'Attempt' because it does not describe a past suicide attempt.
    The phrase ""I just want to disappear"" is a common and explicit way of expressing a desire to die or cease existing, fulfilling the criteria for 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide"".
    *   Emotional indicators: The question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" suggests strong suicidal feelings.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""I just need a plan for suicide"". This indicates a desire to make a plan, but not that a plan is currently detailed *in the post*.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post explicitly states the *need* for a plan, implying one is not yet formed or being shared.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, only the expressed desire to find a plan.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific plan is mentioned, only the desire for one, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and wanting to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It expresses a desire to die and suicidal thoughts (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"").
    *   It states ""I just need a plan for suicide,"" which means a specific plan (method, means, location) is *not* present in the post itself. The person is seeking a plan, but has not detailed one. This differentiates it from 'Behavior', which requires *mentioning* a plan or method.
    *   There's no mention of past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks a specific plan.

        *   Past: ""car"" (context of past attempt).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of current preparation for a new attempt are mentioned (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note for a *new* attempt).
    *   The post describes saying ""I'm going to kill myself"" and simulating an action (""finger gun""). This points more towards strong ideation than a concrete, actionable plan for a new attempt.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
        *   Past: ""my most recent failed attempt"", ""I wish I stayed in the car"".
        *   Current/Future: The recurring phrases ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" and the ""finger gun"" simulation are current expressions of ideation and distress.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""my most recent failed attempt"" is explicitly stated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""my most recent failed attempt"". This directly aligns with the definition of **Attempt**: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide.""
    *   The post also contains current suicidal ideations: ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"", and the ""finger gun"" simulation.
    *   The definition for **Attempt** includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The current expressions are strong ideations, and while not detailed ""plans"" in the sense of 'Behavior', they represent current suicidal intent.
    *   The ""finger gun"" simulation, while a method, is described as something the person *finds themselves doing*, akin to the uncontrollable utterances, rather than a specific, prepared plan for an imminent attempt. If it were the only element, it might lean towards 'Ideation' or 'Behavior' (if interpreted as a plan). However, given the explicit past attempt, the 'Attempt' category takes precedence according to its definition.
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It's more than 'Ideation' alone because of the reported past attempt.
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because while a method is simulated (""finger gun""), it's not presented as a concrete, prepared plan for a *new* attempt. The rule for 'Behavior' states ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" The focus is on the compulsive nature of these expressions and actions, alongside the history of an attempt.
    *   The rule ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" is the most fitting directive here. The current ideations are strong enough to be considered alongside the past attempt for this rule.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me.

        However, the definition of 'Ideation' itself states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
        The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
        The mention of ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" constitutes a ""specific method."" The ""OR preparations taken"" means a specific method alone is sufficient. The fact that the person feels unable to act on it does not negate that their suicidal thoughts include a specific method.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""horrible life"" indicates despair and hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions a plan: ""i'll dm the address, please come here and murder me"". The method is ""murder"" by another person. The preparation is ""i'll dm the address"".
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""kill me"", ""end my horrible life"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. It is clear that there's a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""i'll dm the address"".
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The plan is for someone else to kill the poster. The 'Behavior' definition examples (""suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations..."") all refer to self-inflicted methods or preparations for self-inflicted suicide. While there is a plan for death, it's not a plan for the poster to *commit suicide themselves* using the types of methods exemplified in the 'Behavior' definition. The agency of the act of killing lies with another person. This makes it uncertain if it fits the ""plan to commit suicide"" as intended by the 'Behavior' category's examples.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""i'll dm the address"").

    *   The post includes a plan for death (""i'll dm the address, please come here and murder me""). However, all examples provided for 'Behavior' describe methods or preparations for *self-inflicted* suicide. Asking someone else to murder you is a plan for death, but it's not a plan for the individual to take their own life through their own direct action in the way the examples illustrate.
    *   Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and the ambiguity of whether ""being murdered by request"" fits the implied definition of a ""plan to commit suicide"" (which seems to focus on self-inflicted acts based on examples), 'Ideation' is the more appropriate category. The post expresses a strong desire to die, and while there's a ""plan"" for death, it doesn't align with the types of plans (self-inflicted) exemplified for the 'Behavior' category.

87,"I'm about to get fired, my boss hates me, and I deserve it. I'm 21, and I graduated college in December. My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city. I haven't dated in years (I don't think I'm very attractive tbh, but this doesn't bother me that much). My family is nuts. I feel like I wasn't allowed a normal childhood, and I've spent my whole life trying to avoid being 'trapped,' but every time I make progress, I wind up worse off than before.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""feeling of dread,"" ""don't see a way out,"" general hopelessness, distress about job, family, social isolation.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. Explicitly states ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen.""
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No (the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used).
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The phrase ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"" is a direct expression of a feeling that life would be preferable if it ceased or if the effort of living was no longer required, which implies a desire to not be alive. ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time"" also contributes to this.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrase ""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore"" is a clear, explicit statement of a feeling that points to a desire for life to end or to not exist. It's not unclear in its implication of wanting relief from life itself.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states, ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen,"" indicating no current plan or intent to act.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is mentioned, so this rule isn't needed to decide between ideation and behavior; it clearly isn't behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings (""I often feel..."") and a general state (""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time""). It expresses current ideation without future intent to act.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains significant general distress and hopelessness (""feeling of dread,"" ""don't see a way out""). However, it goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the phrase ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"". This is an explicit expression of a suicidal thought or feeling, specifically a passive desire for life to end or to not be alive any longer. It's a direct statement of a recurring feeling. The statement ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time"" further supports the presence of thoughts related to death.
    The definition of 'Ideation' is: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits perfectly. The desire to not be alive is expressed, and the post explicitly negates a plan or deliberate action (""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"").
    It is not 'Indicator' because there is more than just general distress or a vague feeling about death; there's an explicit statement that non-existence/non-effort would be ""better.""
    It is not 'Behavior' because no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and thinking about ""suicide"". It also expresses a desire to ""collapse and let go,"" which in this context, points to a desire to not be alive. There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.

        - The post has explicit suicidal thoughts: ""planning to kill myself"".
        - It mentions a plan: to ""kill myself tonight"". The plan includes the act and the timing.
        - It shows preparation: The post itself, with ""Rest In Peace ya'll"", serves as a farewell or suicide note, which is listed as an example of preparation.
        Even without a specific *method* detailed, the combination of a stated plan with a timeframe and the nature of the post as a farewell note fits the 'Behavior' category.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I don't belong here. I need to leave"" indicates hopelessness and a desire to escape. Self-blame for past decisions.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. ""Suffer extraordinary pain"" is a desired outcome or feeling, not a method.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I don't belong here. I need to leave"", and the contemplation of suicide as a solution).

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""Suffer extraordinary pain"" is not a specific suicide method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No explicit plan is present.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm starting to think suicide is the only thing..."", ""I need to leave"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a desire to not ""belong here"" and to ""leave,"" which implies a desire to not be alive. However, there is no specific plan or method mentioned for committing suicide. The phrase ""suffer extraordinary pain"" is a desire for a state of suffering, not a method of suicide. According to the definitions, this falls into 'Ideation' because there are explicit suicidal thoughts but no specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""hanging myself"", ""finally do it"" (referring to suicide), ""deserves to die"", ""Thinking of death"", ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""My life is fucked now. There's no turning it around. I'm just worthless trash"", ""this pain and this fucking shit life"". Also, a perverse happiness associated with the thought of death: ""The thought makes me so happy. Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy.""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: Method is ""hanging myself"". Preparations include ""practicing hanging myself"", ""I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct"".
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit mention of a *completed* past attempt. ""Practicing"" is described as preparation, not a failed attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""hanging myself"", ""finally do it"" in context of hanging).
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it"", ""worthless trash who deserves to die"", ""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy"", ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I've been practicing hanging myself"" and ""I'm going to keep practicing"". This is active preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and future intentions (""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it"", ""I'm going to keep practicing"", ""will be over soon""). The ""practicing"" is an ongoing preparation for a future act.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The ""practicing"" is not framed as a past failed attempt but as current preparation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post includes a specific method (""hanging myself"") and clear signs of preparation (""practicing hanging myself"", ""I'm going to keep practicing""). This goes beyond 'Ideation' which lacks a specific plan or preparation.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken..."" This post clearly fits: explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific method (hanging), and preparations (practicing).
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because the ""practicing"" is described as preparation for a future event, not a past failed attempt.

Therefore, the category is 'Behavior'.

Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die."", ""I want to disappear."", ""one day i will take myself away from here"" (implies ending life/suicide).
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""piece of shit"", ""feel like absolute shit"", ""I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them"", ""I am on the edge"". Strong self-loathing, guilt, despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""take myself away from here"" is a general statement of intent but not a specific plan.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" and ""suicidal"" are used (""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just don't want to exist.""
    *   The user denies being ""suicidal"" but simultaneously expresses a core feeling associated with suicidal ideation (""don't want to exist""). The classification should be based on the expressed feelings/thoughts, not solely on the user's self-labeling.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there's no plan, 'behavior' is not appropriate.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post contains the explicit statement ""I just don't want to exist,"" which is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive. This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    Although the user states ""Im not suicidal or something,"" the expressed sentiment ""I just don't want to exist"" is a form of suicidal ideation. The definition of 'Indicator' states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" or ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post *does* contain a direct indication of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""don't want to exist"") and explicitly mentions ""suicide.""
    Therefore, despite the user's denial of the label ""suicidal,"" the content expresses suicidal ideation. No plan is mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'. It's not a past 'Attempt'. It is more than 'Indicator' because of the direct expression of wanting to not exist.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill you"", ""haven't taken enough"" (implies an action of taking a substance with lethal intent), ""want this nightmare to end"" (often a euphemism for wanting to die).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""afraid"", ""nightmare"" (suggesting severe distress).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""valium"" is mentioned as a specific substance. The phrase ""haven't taken enough"" strongly implies that an action (taking Valium) has already occurred.
    *   References to past attempts: The phrase ""haven't taken enough"" indicates an action of taking Valium has happened, which constitutes an attempt, even if it's very recent or ongoing.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" itself is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just want this nightmare to end,"" in conjunction with ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" and the implication of having already taken some (""haven't taken enough""), strongly expresses a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""valium"" is a specific substance (method).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post goes beyond preparation. ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" suggests the action of ingesting Valium has already occurred.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent action that has been taken (""haven't *taken* enough""). This action, having been initiated, is an attempt. The question about dosage might relate to the current attempt's perceived failure or for future augmentation, but the core is the action already taken.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This post is far too specific and direct to be an indicator. It mentions a method and implies an action.
    *   **Ideation:** While there's a desire to die, the mention of a specific substance (""valium"") and the strong implication that it has already been ingested (""haven't taken enough"") goes beyond ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** This category involves planning or preparation. While ""valium"" is a method, the phrase ""haven't taken enough"" suggests the act of taking it has moved past planning and into action.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The statement ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" implies that a ""concrete action"" (taking Valium, which would be an overdose attempt) *has happened*. The person is reflecting on the perceived insufficiency of this action. The ""past"" here includes the very recent past where the action occurred. The post describes an action of self-harm (taking Valium with lethal intent) that has been carried out.

The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" is crucial. The use of the past participle ""taken"" indicates that the act of ingesting Valium has already occurred. This constitutes an attempt, even if the poster fears it was insufficient. The question ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" is likely in response to this perceived insufficiency of the action already taken.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, in detail, including methods and some outcomes.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states ""Some of these are suicide attempts"" and then goes on to describe three distinct past attempts in detail:
    1.  Overdose on Unisom sleeping pills at age 16, including buying pills and writing a suicide note.
    2.  Slicing neck with a straight razor in November 2020.
    3.  Overdosing on a cocktail of ""every prescription in the house"" in November 2020.
    These are clear descriptions of ""concrete action"" that ""happened in the past,"" fitting the definition of **Attempt**: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    The post also includes the statement ""I don't want to live at all,"" which is current ideation. The 'Attempt' definition includes a note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While ""I don't want to live at all"" is ideation rather than a specific plan, the presence of detailed past attempts is the dominant feature, and this rule reinforces that the 'Attempt' classification should be used when past attempts are described, even if current suicidal thoughts/plans are also present. The core of the post is the recounting of these past actions.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight."" This is a specific method (ligature with a belt using a doorknob) and an action taken.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This describes a very recent, concrete action taken towards suicide that was aborted.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself"", ""I'm ready to be done"", ""I'm so close to just doing it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""belt around my neck"", ""doorknob in the closet"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of placing the belt and sitting down is a preparation and initiation of an attempt.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a specific event that happened ""tonight"" (which is past relative to the moment of writing/posting, even if very recent) which was an aborted attempt. It also expresses strong current ideation and near-future risk (""I'm so close to just doing it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the event with the belt ""tonight"" is a description of a concrete action taken towards suicide which was stopped. This qualifies as an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself""). It describes a specific, concrete action taken ""tonight"" with a method (""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped""). This action, though aborted, constitutes an attempt according to the definition: ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The action described is a concrete step towards suicide.
    The definition of 'Attempt' also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The post describes this recent attempt (""tonight"") and also expresses strong current ideation and being on the verge of another attempt (""I'm so close to just doing it"").
    Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most fitting category.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""scared"", ""too tired of life"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post mentions being ""too scared to kill myself"" and the legal consequences of a failed attempt, but no actual plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""too tired of life"" in the context of being ""too scared to kill myself"" implies a desire to not be alive).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"". It also expresses being ""too tired of life,"" which indicates a desire to not be alive. However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The person states they are ""too scared to kill myself,"" which reinforces the presence of suicidal thoughts but lack of a concrete plan or behavior. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""We start dying the second we are born."" The phrase ""end this bullshit for good"" is a strong euphemism for suicide in this context. ""This will be my second to last post"" also implies a final act.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Extreme hopelessness (""human life has no fucking purpose""), anger (""Fuck this fucking world""), despair (""miserable lives,"" ""rotting away"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" This indicates a timeframe (""April"") and a planned action (""taking a trip"") for the purpose of ending life. ""This will be my second to last post"" can be seen as a preparation or a form of signaling.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""end this bullshit for good"" is a clear expression of wanting to end one's life, especially given the overall tone and context. ""This isn't fucking living"" also supports this.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expression ""end this bullshit for good"" in this context is quite clear about the intent to die, so it's beyond just an 'indicator'.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific method like ""overdose"" or ""gun,"" but a plan is mentioned: ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" The ""trip"" is the planned action, and ""April"" is the timeframe.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""This will be my second to last post"" suggests preparation for a final act. Planning a trip for the explicit purpose of ""ending it"" is also a sign of preparation and planning.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The plan involves a specific action (trip) and a timeframe (April) for the stated purpose of ending life. This seems explicit enough to be considered a plan, not just a vague thought.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions (""I'm taking a trip in April"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""end this bullshit for good""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It refers to future intentions, so it's not 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'ideation' (suicidal thoughts without a specific plan) and 'behavior' (suicidal thoughts with a plan or method).
    *   The post states, ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" This is a plan. It specifies an action (taking a trip), a timeframe (April), and a purpose (to end life).
    *   Additionally, ""This will be my second to last post"" acts as a form of preparation or announcement, which aligns with 'behavior'.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" and ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". A trip planned for the purpose of suicide, along with a ""second to last post"" announcement, fits this definition.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds"". ""od on meds"" (overdose on medication) is a method of self-harm/suicide. ""get hit by a car"" is a wish for a fatal accident, implying a desire for death.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""no body cares"", ""literally no motivation"", ""fucked myself over"", ""parents don't even care"", ""i just wish i could..."", ""i have no one left to turn to"", ""i don't feel like anything anymore it's just blank"". These indicate strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, isolation, worthlessness, and anhedonia.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: Specific methods are mentioned: ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"". No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring pills, writing a note) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""od on meds"" is a well-known suicidal method.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds"" is a direct expression of wanting to die or for life to end.
    *   Given the direct expression of wanting to die via specific means, this goes beyond 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"" are specific methods.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, the post does not mention any preparations like acquiring medications, writing a note, or setting a time/place. It's expressed as a wish.
    *   The 'Ideation' definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" The post contains specific methods (""od on meds"", ""get hit by a car"").
    *   The 'Behavior' definition states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken..."" The mention of ""od on meds"" qualifies as a ""specific method"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current wishes and feelings (""i just wish i could..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""wish i could ... od on meds""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is for suicidal thoughts *without* a specific plan. However, its definition includes a crucial directive: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   The post *does* contain specific ideas/methods: ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"".
    *   The 'Behavior' definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (present) AND ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The mention of ""od on meds"" is a ""specific method"".
    *   Even though it's phrased as a ""wish"" and lacks details of active planning or preparation, the explicit mention of specific methods, combined with the directive in the 'Ideation' definition, points to 'Behavior'. The presence of a specific method is the key differentiator here as per the provided definitions.

    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since suicide or a desire to die is not explicitly mentioned, this leans towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post shows significant distress, hopelessness, and ""very large general dissatisfaction about life."" However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or a desire to die. According to the definition, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" Since there's no explicit mention of suicide, it falls into the 'indicator' category.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for current or future actions are mentioned. The past attempts are mentioned but not detailed with methods.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of current preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" clearly refers to past events. The phrase ""me being suicidal"" refers to a current state or feeling.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the number of past attempts is specified: ""8 times.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states, ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" This is a direct description of past suicide attempts. The definition of ""Attempt"" is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans.""
    The post also mentions ""me being suicidal,"" which indicates current suicidal ideation. The definition of ""Attempt"" includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While ""me being suicidal"" is ideation rather than a specific plan, the presence of clearly stated past attempts alongside current suicidal feelings makes ""Attempt"" the most appropriate category according to the provided definitions and rules, as the rule prioritizes 'Attempt' when past attempts are mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""better off dead.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post uses a somewhat flippant tone (""bruh"", "":D"") but the core statement ""i'm better off dead"" suggests underlying distress or a desire to die.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""i'm better off dead"" is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""better off dead"" is a very common and direct idiom for expressing a desire to die. The definition of 'Ideation' includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". This phrase fits that.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current feeling or statement (""when i say i'm better off dead"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die (""i'm better off dead"").
    *   It does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparation.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt.
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The phrase ""better off dead"" is a direct indication of suicidal thoughts/feelings, specifically a desire to not be alive.
    *   The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post perfectly. The phrase ""i'm better off dead"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive.
    *   'Behavior' requires a plan or method, which is absent.
    *   'Attempt' requires description of a past attempt, which is absent.

Therefore, the post falls into the 'Ideation' category because it expresses a desire to die (""better off dead"") without mentioning a specific plan or method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""overdose help please"", ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an ho ur ago"", ""i dont think i want to die"". The act of taking 44 paracetamol is a severe self-harm act and a suicide attempt.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""sorry"", ""i dont know where else to post/ask this"", ""something is stopping me cllng 999"", ""stomach is hurting very badly"", ""sweating badly and shakingtoo"", ""i feel like a burden"", ""i did this to myself after all"". These indicate distress, regret, fear, physical suffering, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The method is explicit: ""took 44 paracetamol"". The quantity is specific. The action has already been executed.
    *   References to past attempts: The post describes a very recent event (""almost an ho ur ago"") which constitutes an attempt. It's not ""historic"" in the sense of long ago, but it is an action that has already occurred.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" itself is not used. However, ""overdose"" with ""44 paracetamol"" is a clear indication of a suicide attempt.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post says ""i dont think i want to die"" which is an expression of *not* wanting to die *now*, post-act. The act itself implies a previous desire or impulse.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""44 paracetamol"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills is the execution of the plan/act. The post is written after this has occurred.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent past event: ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an ho ur ago"". The consequences are current, but the act of ingestion is in the past.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the event described (""took 44 paracetamol"") is an attempt that happened in the very recent past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post describes a concrete action: taking 44 paracetamol. This action occurred ""almost an ho ur ago,"" which means it is in the past, albeit very recent. The definition of **Attempt** is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    *   The post clearly ""describes"" an ""overdose.""
    *   The action ""happened in the past"" (an hour ago).
    While ""Behavior"" includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior,"" the ""Attempt"" category is more specific for actions that have already been taken and are being described, even if very recent. The post is not about planning or ongoing ideation leading to an immediate act; it's a report of an act that has been completed, and the person is now dealing with the consequences and seeking help. The phrase ""i did this to myself after all"" further frames the action as completed.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to end it"" is a clear expression of wanting to end one's life, implying suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The phrase ""I want to end it"" indicates severe distress and a desire for life to cease.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" indicating a lack of plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - While the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used, ""I want to end it"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to end one's life. In the context of suicidal ideation, this is considered an explicit expression of wanting to die. So, Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""I want to end it"" is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. - The expression ""I want to end it"" is quite clear in its intent to convey a desire to die. The definition of 'Ideation' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". This condition is met.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No, the post states ""I have no idea how"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No, the post states ""no idea how, when or anything else.""
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. - Here, there is an explicit statement of *no* plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - It refers to current intentions (""I want to end it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator**: This category is for posts lacking explicit expression concerning suicide or having only general distress. ""I want to end it"" is more than general distress; it's an explicit desire to die. The definition of 'Ideation' states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Since a desire to die is expressed, it's likely not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation**: This category is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post ""I want to end it"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die. The phrase ""I have no idea how, when or anything else"" confirms the absence of a specific plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly.
    *   **Behavior**: This category requires mention of a plan or method. The post explicitly states there is no plan. So, not 'Behavior'.
    *   **Attempt**: This category is for past attempts. The post refers to current feelings, not past actions. So, not 'Attempt'.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to end it"") but explicitly states a lack of plan (""I have no idea how""). This aligns directly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. While phrases like ""can't handle it anymore"" and ""it feels completely hopeless"" show extreme distress, they are not direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die, this rule applies.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This step is not reached if 'ideation' itself isn't established.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a current state (""I'm in the exact same situation,"" ""how bad I am again"") and current feelings of hopelessness and exhaustion.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness (""it feels completely hopeless""), and exhaustion. However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal plan or behavior. According to the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    The post fits this definition. There is ""general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness"" and ""general expressions of distress"" without explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die.

That's great. i mean it does explain A FUCK TON in my life but it was hard to accept it at first. i'm in therapy again btw so it might get better for me. I have really bad bipolar tendencies tho so i'm a lot like my old abusive uncle except i could never hurt anyone physically, im very good at manipulation and it scares me sometimes bc ion wan be that person. other than feeling lonely and lost as ever and not knowing what to do wit my life i've been overall better compared to the rest of my life. i feel more like myself. starting to accept who i am wether i like who it is or not. i hope everyone is okay, if you aren't there's always a way to improve on something even if your at rock bottom. everyone has to hit that rock bottom to get better too, once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death. my rock bottom was having really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years. these last 2 years since i've been way better tho, weird to think so much has happened in 4 years but also so little. luv y'all please find a way to stay positive and stay safe. even if no one sees my posts this community will forever be the safest place bc i can vent and leave and if i regret a post delete it the next day",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""death"" in the phrase ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death."" This is a general statement about rock bottom, not a direct expression of personal suicidal intent. No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post mentions ""feeling lonely and lost as ever,"" ""bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns,"" ""almost being abusive,"" ""puking everyday for nearly 2 years."" These indicate past and some current distress. However, there are also positive indicators: ""it might get better for me,"" ""i've been overall better,"" ""i feel more like myself,"" ""stay positive and stay safe.""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned. The ""rock bottom"" description involves severe depression and breakdowns, but not a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The mention of ""death"" is a general statement, not a personal desire.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It's clear that suicide is not explicitly mentioned.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there's no ideation to begin with.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past struggles (""my rock bottom was..."", ""these last 2 years since i've been way better"") and current feelings (""feeling lonely and lost as ever"") but also a hopeful outlook (""it might get better for me"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post describes significant past distress, mental health diagnosis (bipolar), and ongoing feelings of being ""lonely and lost."" However, it does not explicitly mention suicide, a desire to die, or any plans/methods. The mention of ""death"" is general. The overall tone also includes hope and improvement (""overall better,"" ""might get better,"" ""stay positive""). According to the definition, ""Indicator: The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. ... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits 'indicator' because while there's distress and a general mention of death in a metaphorical sense, there's no explicit mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts for the author.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ending it soon"", ""overdosing on ibuprofen"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""overwhelmed by guilt"", ""wish i could apologize"", ""pain scares me"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""overdosing on ibuprofen is likely my go-to plan"". The timing is mentioned as ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon"".
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""ending it soon"" is a clear expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""plan on ending it soon"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdosing on ibuprofen"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post states ""thats likely my go-to plan"", which indicates a considered method. While acquisition of means isn't stated, the identification of a specific method (""overdosing on ibuprofen"") is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""plan on ending it soon"", ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent (""ending it soon"").
    *   It also mentions a specific method (""overdosing on ibuprofen"") as a ""go-to plan"".
    *   According to the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method...""
    *   The mention of ""overdosing on ibuprofen"" constitutes a specific method.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method is mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as it refers to future plans.
    Therefore, the category is 'Behavior'.

109,I Relapsed After Almost Two Years. I don't want to get into details but I think I have an addiction to extreme pornography and have had it since I was a kid. Last night/this morning I relapsed and now I feel like shit. If I had a gun I'd kill myself because I know how this goes for me and right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future. I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"" - explicit mention of suicide and a method.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""feel like shit"", ""not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future"", ""born/meant to be fucked up"" - indicates despair, hopelessness, self-loathing.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method (""gun"") is mentioned. The plan is conditional (""If I had a gun...""). No explicit preparations mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""gun"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, the possession or acquisition of the gun is hypothetical.
    *   The Ideation definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   The Behavior definition states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
    *   The mention of a ""gun"" is a specific method. The Ideation definition's clause directly suggests that mentioning a method pushes the classification to 'Behavior'. The Behavior definition also aligns by stating ""explicit planning like a specific method"". The conditionality (""If I had a gun"") makes the plan not immediate or active, but a specific method is clearly identified with the suicidal intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and a specific method (""gun"").
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts... without any specific plan"". However, it also includes the crucial sentence: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
        *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method...""
    *   The post contains a specific idea/method (""gun"") for suicide. According to the Ideation definition's specific instruction, this should be considered 'Behavior'. The Behavior definition is also met because a specific method (""gun"") is mentioned, which counts as ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method"". The conditional nature of the statement (""If I had a gun"") doesn't negate the fact that a specific method is part of the expressed suicidal thought.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""wanna kill myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Distress, hopelessness (""impossible to avoid""), fear (of lung cancer), frustration.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan or method for suicide is mentioned. The desire to ""kill myself"" is expressed as a way to avoid future suffering (seeing self or brother get cancer).
    *   References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts"", ""wanna kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""wanna kill myself"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post expresses a desire to die but does not outline how.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""wanna kill myself before i have to see him or myself get it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and a desire to ""kill myself"". This clearly moves beyond 'indicator'.
    However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for carrying out the suicide. The statement ""wanna kill myself"" is an expression of suicidal feeling/desire without a formulated plan.
    Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation'. It's not 'behavior' because there's no plan. It's not 'attempt' because it refers to current feelings, not a past action.

Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide plan"", ""kill myself"", ""doing it next week"" (referring to the plan), ""worthless existence"", ""Goodbye"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""worthless existence"", ""past years have shit"". The statement ""i'm excited to finally move on"" is a concerning emotional indicator in this context.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""I've got a suicide plan"", ""I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself"", and ""I plan on doing it next week"". While the specific *method* (e.g., pills, weapon) is not detailed in the post, the existence of a formulated plan and a timeline for its execution are clearly stated. The poster also mentions ""after thinking it over i'm pretty sure this will work,"" indicating a degree of planning and perceived viability.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide plan"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""kill myself"", ""excited to finally move on from this worthless existence"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, the exact method (e.g., tools, locations, substances) is not detailed. However, the post explicitly states ""I've got a suicide plan"" and ""I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself and after thinking it over i'm pretty sure this will work."" This indicates a plan with a method exists in the poster's mind.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. Stating ""I've got a suicide plan,"" ""I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself,"" and ""I plan on doing it next week"" are strong indicators of preparation and planning. Setting a timeline (""next week"") is a form of preparation.

    The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
    The post *mentions a plan* (""I've got a suicide plan"").
    It includes ""some form of explicit planning"":
        -   The formulation of a plan itself (""I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself"").
        -   A timeline for execution (""I plan on doing it next week""), which is a preparatory step.
        -   Confidence in the plan (""i'm pretty sure this will work"").
    While the specific *method* isn't disclosed, the existence of a developed plan and a timeline for action moves this beyond ideation. The 'Ideation' category is for content ""without any specific plan"". This post claims a specific plan exists.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions (""I plan on doing it next week"").
    *   No past attempts are specifically described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die. Crucially, it states ""I've got a suicide plan,"" ""I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself,"" and ""I plan on doing it next week."" This indicates more than just suicidal thoughts; it points to a formulated plan and a timeframe for action. This aligns with the 'Behavior' category, which requires mention of a plan and ""some form of explicit planning."" The existence of a plan that the poster believes will work, coupled with a set timeline, constitutes explicit planning and preparation, even if the exact method isn't detailed in the post. It surpasses 'Ideation' which is characterized by the *absence* of a specific plan.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   Emotional indicators: ""Feeling bad"", ""long history of depression"", ""pushed me back down"", ""massive amounts of pain"", ""feel terrible"", ""feel like a piece of crap"".

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states, ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)."" This directly fits the definition of **Attempt**: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    The post also mentions current suicidal thoughts (""I've begun having those thoughts again""), which would qualify as Ideation.
    However, the definition for Attempt includes: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While this post mentions current *thoughts* (ideation) rather than current *plans* (behavior), the primary criterion for 'Attempt' is the description of a past attempt. The presence of a described past attempt is the defining characteristic for this category. The note emphasizes that even with current elements, the 'Attempt' label due to past actions should be used. Given the clear statement of a past suicide attempt, 'Attempt' is the most fitting category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm), ""can't even cut"" (referring to self-harm). No explicit mention of suicide or dying.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Don't even feel like a person anymore,"" ""can't socialize well,"" ""pushing away... most important people,"" ""suffering,"" ""afraid he won't want baggage like me and leave,"" ""go insane,"" ""so many issues,"" ""depression,"" ""It's getting to be too much."" Strong indicators of distress, hopelessness, isolation.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cut"" is mentioned as a coping mechanism for self-harm, but the person states they ""can't even cut."" No plan for suicide is mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses extreme distress and mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm), but not a direct desire to die or end life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and there's no direct expression of wanting to die, this leans towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""Cut"" is mentioned in the context of self-harm, not suicide. No suicidal methods are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Not applicable as there's no suicidal plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings, struggles, and ""thoughts of sh."" It also mentions an inability to currently engage in a past coping mechanism (""can't even cut"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress, depression, and ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm). However, it does not explicitly mention suicide or a desire to die. The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    The mention of ""thoughts of sh"" is a strong sign of distress, but without an explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die, it falls under 'Indicator' according to the provided definitions. The focus is on the *explicit* mention of suicide for 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying: ""when I die"", ""if I'm dead"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""pain is finally over"" (suggests current pain and death as relief), ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead"" (expresses hopelessness and sees death as the sole path to happiness).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., the word ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"")? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead"" is a direct expression of seeing death as the only way to achieve happiness, which implies a desire to die or not be alive to escape current unhappiness/pain. The phrase ""Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over"" also points to an anticipation of death as a release.
    *   The 'Ideation' definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". The statement ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead"" clearly falls into this category. It's not just a ""vague feeling about dying"" (Indicator) but a specific thought linking death to a desired outcome as the *only* way. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the desire to not be alive is explicitly expressed as the sole path to happiness.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned (tools, locations, substances)? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation (notes, acquiring means)? No.
    *   Since no plan or method is mentioned, it does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a future event (""when I die"") and a current state of mind/desire (""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead""). It expresses current suicidal thoughts.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to be dead as the only way to achieve happiness and end pain (""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Indicator' because the expression of wanting to die as the *only* solution is more than ""general expressions of distress"" or a ""vague feeling about dying.""
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan or method.
    *   It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""goodbye"" (implying finality and death).
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""don't care about anything anymore"", ""don't want to live"", ""my life is all downhill"", ""career dreams are ruined"", ""I'll never have kids"", ""I have nothing in my life"". These indicate severe hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""take the leap"" is mentioned, which could imply a method (like jumping) or simply the act of committing suicide. The post itself, with ""goodbye"", acts as a suicide note, which is a form of preparation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"" suggests prior suicidal feelings or ideation but does not explicitly describe a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""don't want to live"", ""kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""take the leap"" is mentioned. While it can be an idiom, in the context of ""kill myself"" and ""goodbye,"" it suggests an impending action or method, even if not fully detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post ending with ""goodbye"" and stating a decision (""I finally decided... to kill myself"") functions as a suicide note, which is a form of preparation.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. However, the definition of 'Behavior' explicitly includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"", ""goodbye"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and the desire to die (""don't want to live""), so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   It refers to current/future intentions, not a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts... but without any specific plan"".
        *   'Behavior' is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide OR exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method OR preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...).""
    *   This post contains:
        1.  Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"").
        2.  Preparations taken: The post itself is a ""goodbye"", functioning as a suicide note. The definition of 'Behavior' lists ""suicide note"" as an example of preparation.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'Behavior' category because it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a form of preparation (the goodbye note). The phrase ""take the leap"" further supports an intended action.

Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""finally ending"", ""Goodbye"". These are strong indicators of suicidal intent.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""relaxed that it's finally ending"" (can indicate a decision has been made and a sense of relief), ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"", ""last 1 year the less said the better"" (indicates recent significant distress).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all"" and ""Playing witcher 3 before i call it quits."" This is a preparatory action, a ""last act."" The ""Goodbye"" also serves as a form of farewell or note. No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon) is mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, phrases like ""end it all"" and ""call it quits"" are direct euphemisms in this context.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expressions are clear enough to move beyond 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No specific method of suicide is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): Yes.
        *   ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" is a stated preparatory action.
        *   ""Goodbye"" acts as a farewell note, which is a form of preparation.
        *   The sequence ""play game, then end it all"" constitutes a plan, even if the method isn't detailed.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"". ""Goodbye"" fits this. The action of doing something ""one last time"" is also a clear preparation. The plan is to ""end it all"" after the game.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current/imminent future intentions (""before i end it all"", ""before i call it quits"", ""Goodbye"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire to die (""end it all"", ""call it quits""), so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It refers to current/future intentions, not a past event, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is for thoughts/desires without a specific plan.
        *   'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide OR exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method OR preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...).""
    The post contains:
        1.  Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""end it all"").
        2.  A plan: to end life after playing the game.
        3.  Preparations: playing the game ""one last time"" (a behavioral step) and saying ""Goodbye"" (akin to a suicide note, which is an example of preparation in the 'Behavior' definition).
    The phrase ""before i end it all"" indicates a sequence of actions and a decision that has moved into a preparatory phase. The ""Goodbye"" is a strong indicator of a final message, fitting the ""suicide note"" example for 'Behavior'. Therefore, the post describes more than just ideation; it describes preparatory behaviors.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""tried to kill herself"" but this refers to *another person* (the friend), not the author of the post.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The author expresses fear (""I'm scared"") and concern for their friend. This is distress.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for the author. The attempt mentioned is by the friend.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The friend ""tried to kill herself three days ago."" This is a past attempt by the *friend*, not the author.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS (for the author):**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned *by the author about themselves*? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions *from the author* of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The author is asking for help regarding their friend.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for the author):**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned *by the author for themselves*? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation *by the author for themselves*? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT (for the author):**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions *of the author*? The author is expressing current fear and seeking help/advice about their friend. There are no suicidal intentions expressed by the author.
    *   Are past attempts *by the author* specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post is about the author's concern and fear for a friend who reportedly attempted suicide. The crucial rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    The author expresses distress (""I'm scared"") but does not mention any suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts *concerning themselves*.
    The definition of ""Indicator"" states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The author's fear and concern for their friend qualify as ""general expressions of distress."" There is no explicit mention of suicide *by the author about themselves*.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""hang myself"", ""kill me"", ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""don't want to be alone anymore"", ""been alone since I was 5"", ""haven't had a friend"", ""only sit in my room alone everyday it makes me sick"", ""scared to go out"", ""nobody has ever liked me"". These indicate severe distress, loneliness, and hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""hang myself"", ""looking for something that I can tie"", ""I don't think the thing will break off as I am only 44kg"" (shows consideration of the method's effectiveness).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" refers to past self-harm, but not explicitly a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""hang myself"", ""kill me"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I will hang myself now"", ""kill me"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""hang myself"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes (""I'm now looking for something that I can tie""). The comment about weight (""I don't think the thing will break off as I am only 44kg"") also suggests active consideration of the plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/imminent future intentions (""I will hang myself now"", ""I'm now looking for..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No specific past suicide attempt is described, only past self-harm.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""hang myself"", ""kill me"") and a clear expression of wanting to die. More importantly, it includes a specific method (""hang myself"") and active preparation (""I'm now looking for something that I can tie""). The detail about weight further supports that the individual is actively planning. This goes beyond mere ideation. It is not an 'attempt' as it refers to current/imminent actions, not past ones. It is not 'indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""want to die"" is mentioned, but in a negating context: ""It's not even that I just want to die."" No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong emotional distress is present: ""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" ""miserable,"" ""can barely function,"" ""don't even know how to just live anymore,"" ""being ripped apart,"" ""can't stop shaking,"" ""How am I supposed to live like this?"". These indicate hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No. ""Suicide"" or ""killing oneself"" is not mentioned.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): No. The post states, ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" which is an explicit negation of a desire to die. While phrases like ""I don't even know how to just live anymore"" and ""How am I supposed to live like this?"" express profound difficulty with living and hopelessness, they are not direct expressions of wanting to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The negation of wanting to die makes it clear that there isn't an *expressed* desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   This step is not applicable as we are not leaning towards 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current feelings and state.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and an inability to cope with life (""I don't even know how to just live anymore""). However, it does not contain explicit mentions of suicide. Crucially, it explicitly negates a desire to die (""It's not even that I just want to die."").
    The definition of **Indicator** states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    The definition of **Ideation** states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
    Since the post explicitly denies wanting to die and does not mention suicide, and the distress expressed aligns with ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness,"" it fits the 'Indicator' category. The rule ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" is directly applicable here due to the negation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   Emotional indicators: ""Hate this rat race"", ""overwork me"", ""can't handle it"", ""don't see the need"", ""Tf is this life?"", ""I want out."" - Expresses strong dissatisfaction, feeling overwhelmed, hopelessness.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to commit suicide (""I just want to kill myself"") and a desire to not be alive (""I want out""). This clearly goes beyond 'indicator'.
    There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide, so it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.
    There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post quotes a bully saying to the author's friend, ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself."" This is a mention of suicide, but it's directed at the friend by a third party, and reported by the author.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The author expresses concern for the friend (""She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed""). The author also expresses a desire for ""justice"" against the bully. There are no direct emotional indicators of hopelessness or despair *from the author regarding their own life*. The distress is about the friend's situation.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the author for themself. The author asks about posting the bully's information, which is a plan for retaliation, not self-harm.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned by the author regarding themself.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS (for the author):**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned *by the author about themselves*? No. The mention of ""kill yourself"" is a quote of what a bully said to the author's friend.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive *from the author*? No. The author is focused on the friend's well-being and seeking retribution against the bully.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for the author):**
    *   Not applicable, as there are no suicidal expressions from the author.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT (for the author):**
    *   The post refers to an ongoing situation (""Its going on 5 days now"") and the author's current concern and desire for action. It does not refer to past suicidal events or current/future suicidal intentions *for the author*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The core rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   The author of the post is not expressing any personal suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or behaviors.
    *   The author is expressing significant distress and concern about their friend who is being severely bullied. This falls under ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" as described in the ""Indicator"" category, where the distress is about the situation involving the friend.
    *   The explicit mention of ""kill yourself"" is a quote attributed to a bully directed at the friend. It is not an expression of suicidal ideation from the author themselves.
    *   The definition of ""Indicator"" states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide [by the author about themselves]. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings [by the author about themselves]."" This fits the author's situation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""want to hang myself so bad"", ""how much longer I could last here on earth"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""loser"", ""ugly"", ""no motivation"", ""isolated"", ""Alot of mental illness"", ""people dont get my pain"", ""feel so alone"", ""nothing to look forward to"". Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""want to hang myself so bad"" mentions a specific method (hanging). No explicit mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring a rope, setting a time).
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. ""I have tried to reach out"" refers to seeking help, not an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide is on my mind everyday"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself"", ""want to hang myself so bad"", ""how much longer I could last here on earth"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned (e.g., ""I have a rope ready""). However, the definition of 'behavior' states it ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method"".
    *   The definition of 'ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" ""Hang myself"" is a specific method/way.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""want to hang myself so bad"", ""how much longer I could last"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die. This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   No past attempts are described, so it's not 'attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as suicidal thoughts ""without any specific plan"". It also states, ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method...""
    *   The phrase ""want to hang myself so bad"" includes a specific method (""hang myself""). This aligns with the criteria for 'behavior' because a specific method is mentioned. The desire is strong, and it's coupled with a ""how.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""still alive unfortunately,"" ""attempted once again,"" ""15th time,"" ""still want to attempt again."" These are direct references to suicide attempts and a desire for death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""unfortunately"" (regarding being alive) indicates despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific *current* plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned for a future attempt. The post refers to past actions.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, explicitly: ""last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""attempted once again"").
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes (""still alive unfortunately,"" ""still want to attempt again"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific methods for current or future attempts are detailed.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No signs of preparation for a *current* attempt.
    *   The focus is on past actions and current desire, not current planning with methods.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to a very recent past event (""last night I attempted"") and current/future intentions (""still want to attempt again""). It also refers to multiple past attempts (""15th time"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** Yes, ""last night I attempted once again."" This is a concrete action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""last night I attempted once again."" This is a clear description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   The post also mentions, ""still want to attempt again,"" which indicates current suicidal ideation or intention.
    *   The definition for **Attempt** states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). ... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   This post fits the 'Attempt' category perfectly because it describes a past attempt (""last night I attempted"") and also mentions current suicidal desire/intention (""still want to attempt again""). The specific rule ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" applies directly.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because no specific *current* plan or method for a future attempt is detailed.
    *   While 'Ideation' is present (""still want to attempt again""), the presence of a described past attempt, especially with the rule about co-occurrence with current plans, makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate category.

I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting and I know this is going to be another failure, I'm still too scared to go all the way through. I know I'll wake up later, and while I know this, I want so badly to reach out to my friends and ask them to check up on me but I don't want to put them through something as scary as this. I don't want them to have to deal with me during this. I knew this morning the moment I woke up that it would lead to this.

I'm sad right now and I want nothing more than someone to sit with me in silence while I cry. But I'm alone. I can't reach out. So all I ask is this, please check up on me later.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end of my rope,"" ""don't see a reason,"" ""breath slowing down,"" ""chest is hurting,"" ""another failure,"" ""still too scared to go all the way through,"" ""I hope I don't wake up,"" ""as I've done this before."" These suggest a current crisis and past actions.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""end of my rope,"" ""everything's crumbling,"" ""don't see a reason,"" ""scared,"" ""sad,"" ""alone.""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method is explicitly stated for the current situation, but the physical sensations described (""breath slowing down, chest hurting,"" ""falling asleep"") combined with ""this is going to be another failure"" and ""as I've done this before"" imply an action is being taken or has just been taken, similar to past actions.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: Yes, ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" and ""this is going to be another failure"" clearly indicate past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" The phrase ""still too scared to go all the way through"" also implies an intention to die.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly for the current event. However, the description of physical symptoms (""breath slowing down, my chest is hurting,"" ""feel myself falling asleep"") in the context of ""this is going to be another failure"" and ""as I've done this before"" suggests a repeated method, even if unspecified.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post describes an ongoing situation.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""as I've done this before"" and ""another failure"" refer to past events. The current state (""I'm at the end of my rope right now,"" ""I feel my breath slowing down,"" ""I hope I don't wake up"") refers to current intentions/actions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" clearly indicates a past action was taken that was an attempt but was survived. ""Another failure"" reinforces this.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions past actions: ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" and ""this is going to be another failure."" This fulfills the core criterion for ""Attempt,"" which is the description of past attempts. The definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The phrase ""done this before"" implies a concrete past action.
    Furthermore, the rule ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" applies here. The current statements (""I feel my breath slowing down,"" ""I hope I don't wake up"") indicate current ideation and potentially ongoing behavior, but the clear reference to past attempts makes ""Attempt"" the most fitting category.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""lost my sibling this year"", ""lost all will to live"", ""still want to die"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse"", ""lost all will to live"", ""still want to die"", ""please help"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post mentions ""The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child,"" which is a protective factor, not a plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""lost all will to live"" and ""I still want to die"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While ""suicide"" isn't mentioned, ""want to die"" is a very direct expression of wanting to not be alive, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""a desire to not be alive any longer"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is present.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past events (sibling's death, worsening depression) leading to current intentions/feelings (""I still want to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""lost all will to live"", ""I still want to die""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    It is not 'Indicator' because the desire to die is explicit.
    It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation.
    It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    The phrase ""I still want to die"" is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive, fulfilling the criteria for 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thinking of suicide for months on end"", ""my end will only get nearer"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""deepest depths of myself and darkest corners"", ""deeper than I've ever been"", implying significant distress and hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions taking ""a few tabs of acid"" (LSD). This is presented as an action to see if it helps, with the alternative being ""my end will only get nearer"". It's not explicitly stated as a suicide method, but rather a gamble with life.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""thinking of suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""my end will only get nearer"", and being ""fine with either outcome"" where one outcome is the ""end"" getting nearer).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The post mentions taking ""a few tabs of acid"". However, the context is ""see what happens first, if it helps me then hey that's great, if it doesn't ... my end will only get nearer."" This frames the acid use as an attempt to cope or find a different path, rather than a direct suicide method. If the acid *doesn't* help, the ""end"" is contemplated, but no specific method for that ""end"" (suicide) is detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Preparation to take acid, but not explicitly for a suicide act itself.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The plan to take acid is clear, but it's not explicitly stated as *the method of suicide*. It's more of a conditional action, where failure leads to the ""end"" by unspecified means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and future intentions (""thinking of suicide for months on end"", ""I'd rather take a few tabs of acid and see what happens first"", ""my end will only get nearer"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ongoing suicidal thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There's a clear expression of suicidal thoughts (""thinking of suicide"") and a potential for ""my end"" to get nearer. This points to 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.
    *   The critical point is whether taking LSD is presented as a suicide plan. The phrasing suggests it's an experiment: if it helps, great; if not, the suicidal state persists or worsens, bringing the ""end"" closer. The ""end"" itself, and the method for it, are not specified. The LSD is a substance, but its use here is framed as a potential (if risky) coping mechanism or a test, not as the direct means of suicide.
    *   According to the 'Behavior' definition, it must include ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable to end ones life)"". While LSD is a drug, its intended use here is ambiguous in terms of being a suicide method. The person is taking it to ""see what happens,"" not explicitly to die from it. If it fails to help, then suicide becomes more likely, but the method for *that* suicide is not stated.
    *   Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and the ambiguity of whether taking acid is the suicide plan itself or a precursor, 'Ideation' is more appropriate. The desire to die is present, and suicidal thoughts are explicit, but a concrete plan *for suicide* is not detailed.
    *   No past attempts are mentioned, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

    The post expresses strong suicidal thoughts and a desire for the ""end"" if the LSD doesn't work. However, it lacks a specific, explicit plan or method *for suicide*. The plan is to take LSD, and the *outcome* of that action will determine if the ""end"" gets nearer. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of death, dying, or suicide. The act of stealing and taking the dog's hydrocodone is a form of substance misuse and could be considered a risky behavior or self-harm in a general sense, but the stated intent is ""to feel ok,"" not to end life.
    *   Note emotional indicators: ""hit a new low tonight,"" ""just to feel ok for one night,"" ""haven't felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations (for suicide): No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The hydrocodone was taken to cope with distress, not as a stated suicide method.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Since suicide is not mentioned, this supports 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for suicide):**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned (for suicide)? No. The hydrocodone use is described as a coping mechanism for distress, not as a method to end life.
    *   Are there signs of preparation (for suicide)? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This rule is not directly applicable yet as there's no ideation expressed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a current situation (""tonight,"" ""haven't felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness (""hit a new low,"" ""haven't felt ok,"" ""not sure what to do""), and engages in risky behavior (substance misuse: taking dog's hydrocodone, drinking). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any plan to end life. The hydrocodone was taken ""just to feel ok.""

    According to the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This fits the post. The distress and substance misuse are strong indicators of a problem, but suicide itself is not mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** Requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is absent.
    *   **Behavior:** Requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions... a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" There are no explicit suicidal thoughts. While taking the dog's medication is self-harming in a broad sense, the definition seems to tie ""self-harming behavior"" to the context of suicidal thoughts and plans. The stated intent for taking the medication was to ""feel ok,"" not to die.
    *   **Attempt:** Not applicable as it refers to past attempts.

    The post clearly shows distress and risky coping mechanisms. Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die, it falls into the 'Indicator' category. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" further supports this.

    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrase ""no point in living anymore"" is a very strong and direct expression of a desire to not be alive. The definition of 'Ideation' includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". This seems to fit. The 'Indicator' definition states ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" However, ""no point in living anymore"" goes beyond general dissatisfaction and directly addresses the will to live. This is an explicit expression of a suicidal feeling.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as no plan elements are present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I see no point... anymore"", ""Nothing... *is* working out"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains ""I see no point in living anymore,"" which is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   It is more than 'Indicator' because the phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" is a direct expression of suicidal feeling (a desire to not be alive), not just general distress or hopelessness without such a direct statement about life itself. The 'Ideation' definition explicitly states ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow."" This is a clear indication of self-harm with potentially lethal intent.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""how fucked up I am,"" ""unfair on them,"" ""my problems are my own,"" ""feel so guilty."" These indicate significant distress.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a specific method (overdose of pills). The act of taking them is the execution.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The post describes a current or very recent action (""taken... and might not wake up tomorrow""), not a clearly demarcated past event.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""might not wake up tomorrow"" following the act of taking ""a fuck load of pills"" is a direct expression of accepting or intending death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills"" (implying an overdose).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of ""taken a fuck load of pills"" implies acquiring and consuming them, which is the execution of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent action (""taken"") with an immediate potential future outcome (""might not wake up tomorrow""). This is a current crisis, not a historical event.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, this is about a current/very recent action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there's an explicit action (taking pills) and a clear implication of suicidal intent (""might not wake up tomorrow""). It's far beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because a specific method (""pills"") and action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") are mentioned. It's not just thoughts or desires.
    *   **Attempt:** This category is for ""past attempts"" and ""historic actions."" The post describes an action that has just occurred or is ongoing, with the outcome pending. It's not a reflection on a completed past event. For example, ""Last week I took pills"" would be an attempt. ""I have taken pills and might not wake up"" describes a current, unfolding situation.
    *   **Behavior:** This category includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs...).""
        *   ""might not wake up tomorrow"" (after taking pills) = expression of suicidal outcome/intent.
        *   ""taken a fuck load of pills"" = exhibits self-harming behavior and mentions a specific method (lethal medication/drugs).
        This fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it describes a current self-harming action with a specific method and suicidal intent. The action has been initiated and is in its immediate phase.

The post describes an action that has been taken (""taken a fuck load of pills"") with a potentially fatal outcome (""might not wake up tomorrow""). This is a self-harming behavior with a clear method, fitting the 'Behavior' category. It is not a historical ""attempt"" but a current crisis.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post states ""I'm planning out my suicide"" and provides a timeframe: ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest."" This indicates active planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. Current/future intentions: ""I'm planning out my suicide"", ""I have an intention in the beginning of the new year"", ""I will go through with this"". Past events: ""fear of failing an attempt once again"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""failing an attempt once again"" clearly indicates a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""planning out my suicide"") and a desire to die (""can't find a reason... to continue living"").
    It mentions current planning: ""I'm planning out my suicide"" and a specific timeframe ""January 1st"". This could point towards 'Behavior'.
    Crucially, it also refers to a past attempt: ""fear of failing an attempt once again"".
    The definition for **Attempt** states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    This post clearly refers to a past attempt (""failing an attempt once again"") AND mentions current plans (""planning out my suicide"", ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st"").

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and a desire not to live (""do not want to live anymore""). This rules out 'indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""attempt suicide frequently"", ""hang myself"", ""don't die"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Not explicitly stated, but the actions described imply significant distress.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""hang myself"", ""leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto"". This describes a specific method used repeatedly.
    *   References to past attempts: ""attempt suicide frequently"" explicitly refers to multiple past actions. The description ""i hang myself but always leave a chair..."" details these past actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""attempt suicide frequently"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""attempt suicide"", even if qualified by ""half heartedly"" and ""so i don't die"". The intent behind the *action* described is framed as a suicide attempt.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - Yes, ""hang myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - The act of hanging implies preparation (e.g., rope, location), and the ""chair or elevated object"" is part of the described setup for these repeated actions.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - It refers to ""frequently"" occurring past events (""i ... attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - Yes, the post describes a recurring pattern of specific actions (""hang myself but always leave a chair"") that the user labels as suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently."" This directly indicates past actions. The user then describes the method of these frequent attempts: ""i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die.""
    The definition of ""Attempt"" is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    The user is describing concrete actions (""hang myself"") that have happened ""frequently"" in the past, and they label these actions as ""suicide attempts."" Even if ""half heartedly"" and with a safety measure, the user frames them as attempts. The focus is on these repeated past actions.
    It is not 'Ideation' because specific actions are described.
    It is not 'Behavior' in the sense of a current plan for a *future* attempt, but rather a description of a pattern of past actions. While it could be seen as ongoing self-harming behavior, the explicit framing as ""attempt suicide frequently"" aligns it more closely with the ""Attempt"" category, which focuses on described past attempts. The definition of ""Attempt"" covers ""describes past attempts at suicide,"" which this post does directly.

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt: ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out."" This meets the primary criterion for the 'Attempt' category.
    *   The post also contains current suicidal ideation: ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" ""this world's just not meant for me.""
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   The current expressions of wanting to die (""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"") can be considered ""current plans"" in the sense of current suicidal intentions or desires, even if not a specific behavioral plan. The rule prioritizes the 'Attempt' classification when a past attempt is mentioned alongside current suicidal expressions.
    *   Therefore, based on the explicit mention of a past attempt and the rule regarding co-occurrence with current suicidal expressions, the category is 'Attempt'.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""Suffering from depression and anxiety"", ""hate the stupid decisions"", ""no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals"", ""mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame"", ""I hate myself"", ""Useless, shameless, pathetic loser"", ""miserable ass"". Strong feelings of hopelessness, self-hatred, worthlessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions past methods: ""drown myself"", ""hang"", ""jump off from the 4th floor"". No current specific plan is detailed, but past actions are.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time."" This explicitly refers to past actions.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" itself is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes: ""Why should I still live"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. It's quite clear there's an expression of wanting to die.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""drown myself"", ""hang"", ""jump off from the 4th floor"". These are mentioned in the context of past actions.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not for a current attempt, but the description of past actions implies preparation for those past events.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The methods are tied to past attempts, not current plans.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It strongly refers to past events: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off... I chickened out each time."" It also expresses current distress and a desire not to live (""Why should I still live"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, very clearly: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor"". The phrasing ""I tried to..."" indicates an action was initiated.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly states, ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time."" This describes past actions taken with the intent to end life, even if they were not completed. The definition of 'Attempt' is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The user describes initiating concrete actions. The rule ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" also applies, even though it's current ideation rather than a full plan, the presence of past attempts is key.

Living is just so frustrating for someone like me, it doesn't help that i'm sensitive af and that my relationship with my mom sucks. To top it all off I have been doing nothing for the past year dropped out of college because I was burned out and quite my parttime job.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old."", ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself which is the only positive thing."", ""I might actually get the courage to do it.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""Living is not for me"", ""Living is so frustrating for me"", ""crippling anxiety"", ""sensitive af"", ""relationship with my mom sucks"", ""burned out"". Strong hopelessness and frustration.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old."" This is a conditional statement about the past, suggesting strong past ideation but not a concrete described attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Living is not for me"", ""I would have been gone"", ""confident to kill myself"", ""get the courage to do it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is mentioned, so it's not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past feelings (""when I was 15 years old"") and current/future intentions (""becoming more confident to kill myself"", ""might actually get the courage to do it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The statement ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old"" is a hypothetical about the past, indicating strong desire or ideation at that time, but not a described action taken. The definition of 'Attempt' states ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past... When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" This falls into the ""merely thought"" or ""would have done"" category rather than a described concrete action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""suicide"", ""kill myself"") and expresses a clear desire to die (""Living is not for me"", ""confident to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   The reference to being ""gone when I was 15 years old"" is conditional and does not describe a concrete past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not suitable. It indicates past ideation.
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to no longer be alive, without a specific plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

142,Too much. Well it finally happened I got to the point where the pain is too much and the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better. I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""die"", ""dead"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""pain is too much"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""enough Trazodone"", ""will get alcohol today"", ""be dead in less than 24 hours"". Trazodone is a medication, and combining it with alcohol is a method. Stating they ""have enough Trazodone"" and ""will get alcohol today"" indicates preparation and access to means.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better"" suggests past suicidal ideation or expressions that were perhaps dismissed, leading to concealment, but it doesn't explicitly describe a past *action* of attempting suicide.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" isn't used, but ""die"" and ""dead"" in the context of self-action are clear.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""be dead in less than 24 hours"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Trazodone"" and ""alcohol"". This combination is a known method for overdose.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have enough Trazodone"" (means already acquired) and ""will get alcohol today"" (intention to acquire further means for the plan). The timeline ""less than 24 hours"" also points to a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, there's no description of a past *action* taken to end life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses a clear intent to die (""be dead""). It also specifies a method (Trazodone and alcohol) and preparations (having Trazodone, planning to get alcohol) with a timeline (""less than 24 hours""). This goes beyond mere ideation because a specific plan and means are mentioned. It is not an 'attempt' as it describes a future action, not a past one. It is not an 'indicator' as the desire to die and the method are explicit. Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category.

Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""I want to give up"" - in this context, strongly implies giving up on life.
        *   ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"" - questions the purpose of being alive, implying a lack of desire to be.
        *   ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" - reinforces feelings of futility and potential desire for life to end.
        *   No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""self-harm.""

    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The words ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" etc., are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The combination of ""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive,"" and ""My life has no worth. No meaning"" collectively expresses a clear desire to not be alive or for life to end. This is more than general sadness; it's a direct questioning and rejection of life's value for the poster.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there's no plan, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The expressions of wanting to give up and questioning life are current.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    *   While ""suicide"" isn't explicitly named, phrases like ""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive,"" and ""My life has no worth"" are strong indicators of a desire to not be alive any longer. This aligns with the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   It's beyond **Indicator** because 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide...May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide...Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" The post here goes beyond ""general dissatisfaction"" or ""vague feeling about dying""; it expresses a more direct desire for life to cease or a profound questioning of its continuation. The 'Ideation' definition also states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Here, a desire to not be alive *is* expressed.
    *   It is not **Behavior** because no plan or method is mentioned.
    *   It is not **Attempt** because no past attempt is described.
    *   The key is the ""explicit expressions of ... a desire to not be alive any longer."" The combination of statements in the post meets this criterion for Ideation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""let myself pass away"" (dying)

        *   ""when I die"" (dying)
        *   Anorexia is mentioned as the method for self-harm leading to death.
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied hopelessness, resignation (""let myself pass away""), a desire for a specific outcome (""look like a fucking skeleton when I die"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Method: Anorexia, specifically by reducing body weight to a lethal level.
        *   Plan: ""my new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me."" This is a specific target and implies a process.
        *   Preparation: The ongoing act of anorexia and the setting of a lethal weight goal.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes (""let myself pass away,"" ""I'm going to die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - Yes, the method is anorexia, with a specific target weight (""78 pounds, but I might have to go lower""). This is a method of self-destruction.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - The post outlines a ""goal weight"" and a process (""slowly kill myself this way""). The ""means"" is the control of food intake to achieve a lethal weight. The statement ""I currently weigh 90 pounds, but my new goal weight is 78 pounds"" shows active progression towards the plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current and future intentions (""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""my new goal weight is,"" ""it will give people plenty of time"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself"") and a desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post includes not just suicidal thoughts but a specific method (anorexia, achieving a lethal weight target of ""78 pounds, but I might have to go lower"") and a stated intention to carry it out (""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""slowly kill myself this way""). This constitutes a plan.
    *   According to the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
        *   Explicit suicidal thoughts: Yes.
        *   Plan/Method: Yes, using anorexia to reach a lethal weight.
        *   Preparations: Setting a specific weight goal and acknowledging it might need to be lower to be fatal.
    *   It is not an 'Attempt' as it describes current/future intentions, not a past action.
    *   Since there's an explicit mention of suicide and a specific method/plan (achieving a lethal weight through anorexia), it fits 'Behavior'.

    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned. ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" refers to a specific method (carbon monoxide poisoning).
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Not explicitly stated, but the question implies a consideration of suicide.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") is mentioned. The post is a question about the viability of this method for suicide. No preparations are mentioned.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific method.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The question implies current consideration or future intention to understand the viability of a method.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and a ""specific method"" (""charcoal bbq in a tent"").
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because it does not describe a past attempt.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... *but without any specific plan* to commit suicide.""

    *   The post mentions a ""specific method"" (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") in the context of ""suicide"". Asking about the possibility/viability of this specific method for suicide goes beyond general ideation (""I want to die"") and into the realm of considering a specific plan or method. The definition of 'Behavior' states ""mentions... a plan... like a specific method"". Inquiring about the feasibility of a specific method for suicide fits this description. The plan is not fully detailed (e.g., ""I will do this tomorrow""), but a specific method is being actively explored for the purpose of suicide. This constitutes ""mentioning a plan"" or ""explicit planning like a specific method.""

Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post uses a strong metaphor: ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the 'dog' put itself down."" This is a clear reference to the writer contemplating suicide, with ""the dog"" representing themselves and ""put itself down"" meaning suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is laden with emotional distress: ""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Im tired,"" ""Nothing's real to me anymore,"" ""I can't find a way to release,"" ""I'm an abomination,"" ""What is wrong with me."" There are strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, confusion, and self-loathing.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions a timeline: ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around."" This indicates a conditional plan based on time. However, no specific *method* (tools, location, substances) for suicide is mentioned. The phrase ""put itself down"" describes the act of suicide, not the means.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, through the metaphor ""the 'dog' put itself down.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""I can't do it anymore,"" combined with the ""put itself down"" metaphor and the ""3 weeks"" timeline, strongly expresses a desire to die or end life if things don't improve.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No. While ""put itself down"" refers to the act of suicide, it does not specify *how* this would be done (e.g., no mention of tools, substances, locations).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The ""3 weeks"" timeline is a sign of conditional planning regarding *when* a decision might be made or an action taken. However, it's not preparation in the sense of acquiring means or writing a note as exemplified in the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** The ""plan"" here is a temporal condition, not a plan detailing the method of suicide. The 'Behavior' definition emphasizes ""specific method or preparations taken.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post refers to current distress and future intentions/conditions (""I'm giving it 3 weeks,"" ""Eventually it'll get sick enough..."").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned via the ""put itself down"" metaphor.
    *   The post is not 'Attempt' as there is no mention of past suicide attempts.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
        *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...).""
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""put itself down"") and a desire to die (""I can't do it anymore""). It also includes a conditional timeline (""3 weeks""). However, it lacks a *specific method* or the types of preparations (acquiring means, specific location) listed under 'Behavior'. The ""3 weeks"" is a plan for *when* the ideation might escalate, but not *how* it would be carried out.
    *   Given the absence of a specific method and the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" the post fits 'Ideation' best. The ""plan"" mentioned in 'Behavior' seems to refer to the logistics of the act itself (method, means), which are not present here.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""thought of suicide"", ""plotting my suicide"", ""suicide pact with yourself"", ""demise"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""slump and horrid hole of thoughts"", ""torment of thoughts"", ""tired"", ""fucking delicate"", ""cannot stand being weak"", ""feel different"", ""can't 'click' into life"". Also mentions relief when out of the slump, and shame/guilt for not following through on the ""suicide pact"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months"", ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"". Also, considerations about *how not to do it* or conditions: ""I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household."" These indicate thought about methods and execution.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit past attempts are described as actions taken. It mentions ""thought of this... for how long"" but not an action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""thought of suicide"", ""plotting my suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied strongly through ""plotting my suicide"", the ""suicide pact with yourself"", and the feeling of ""obligation"" towards suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? While a specific finalized method isn't detailed, the post mentions ""plotting my suicide seriously"". It also includes considerations about methods: ""I would never use a weapon from my household,"" and ""I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so."" This shows active thought about the *how*.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, very clearly: ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" This is a significant preparatory action. ""Plotting"" itself is a form of planning.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)."" Drafting a will is a preparation. ""Plotting"" indicates ongoing planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to ongoing planning (""plotting... on and off for months""), a recent past preparatory action (""Yesterday, I drafted my will""), and current reflections. While the user states ""I am out of my hole for now"" and ""I don't think I would do 'it'"", the post's content describes these planning activities and preparations.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and suicidal thoughts, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond 'Ideation' because it describes specific preparatory actions (""drafted my will"") and ongoing planning (""plotting my suicide seriously""). The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken"". Drafting a will is a clear preparation. The detailed thoughts about *how* (e.g., not using household weapons, who would find them) also point towards planning, even if some of it is about ruling out options or setting conditions. The combination of ""plotting"" and ""drafted my will"" firmly places this into the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post includes the statement, ""i feel like he would be better off without me."" This implies the writer's own death or disappearance would be a positive outcome for someone else, which is a thought concerning one's own non-existence.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses feelings of being ""stressed,"" ""depressed,"" anxiety, being ""sick of this endless myopic bouts of 'criticism',"" feeling ""abused enough at home,"" and a sense of hopelessness/isolation (""if i leave them i have no one"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past suicide attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is an explicit expression of a thought that one's absence (implying death or disappearance) would be beneficial to others. This is a common suicidal thought and strongly implies a diminished will to live or a feeling that life is not worth living, at least from the perspective of its impact on others. It's an explicit expression of a suicidal thought/feeling.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The feelings and thoughts expressed (""i feel like he would be better off without me,"" ""i am so sick of this"") are current.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains the statement ""i feel like he would be better off without me."" This is an explicit expression of a suicidal thought – specifically, the idea that one is a burden and others would be better off if one were not alive.
    *   The definition of **Indicator** states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The phrase ""he would be better off without me"" is a direct indication of suicidal thoughts.
    *   The definition of **Ideation** states it ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""he would be better off without me"" is an explicit expression of a suicidal thought. While not a direct ""I want to die,"" it's a clear articulation of a thought pattern strongly associated with suicidal ideation and implies that the writer's non-existence is being contemplated as a positive outcome for others.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it does not meet the criteria for **Behavior**.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not **Attempt**.
    *   Given that ""he would be better off without me"" is an explicit expression of a suicidal thought, the category **Ideation** is the most appropriate.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally."" This is directed at another person (""you""), wishing for their death or continued inaction that would lead to peace for ""us"" (including the poster). It's not a statement about the poster's own suicidal intent. The poster expresses ""i'm so tired,"" ""she has sucked my soul out dry, i have no more energy to deal with this anymore."" This indicates extreme exhaustion and emotional depletion, but not direct suicidal ideation.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong anger (""FUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCFFFKKKKKKKK YOUUUUU"", ""i fucking hate you""), extreme tiredness (""i'm so tired"", ""i have no more energy""), feeling overwhelmed (""the world is just fucked in every single way. EVERYTHING IS FUCKED""), despair, and a sense of abandonment.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for the poster.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not by the poster about themselves.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The poster states ""i have no more energy to deal with this anymore,"" which is a strong expression of distress and being overwhelmed, but it's not a direct or explicit statement of wanting to die or not be alive. It's a general expression of exhaustion and inability to cope.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The statement ""i have no more energy to deal with this anymore"" is very close to expressing a desire for things to end, but it doesn't explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" It focuses on the lack of energy to *deal with the situation*.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. (Not applicable yet as we are still determining if it's ideation).

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past trauma (""why did you this? why us? why didn't you tell my dad what they did? how can you do those sorts of things to a child"") and current overwhelming feelings. There are no clear future intentions regarding self-harm for the poster.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post expresses extreme emotional distress, anger, hopelessness (""the world is just fucked""), and a feeling of being completely drained (""i have no more energy to deal with this anymore""). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide or a direct statement from the poster about wanting to die or end their own life. The rule states: ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" The phrase ""i have no more energy to deal with this anymore"" is a strong expression of distress but not an explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die. The focus is on the inability to cope with the situation. The wish for someone else to ""lay in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"" is about another person, not the poster's own suicide. Therefore, the post fits the 'Indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I don't want to kill myself, but."" This is an explicit mention of ""kill myself.""
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""literally nothing going for me,"" ""pushed all my friends away,"" ""barely leave the house,"" ""sick of sitting inside,"" ""sick of _this_ life,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""stagnant,"" ""world rejects me,"" ""don't know what's next,"" ""walls are closing in,"" ""no escape."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post says ""I don't want to kill myself, but..."" This is a negation, but the ""but"" followed by extreme despair suggests the thought of suicide is present and being struggled with. Phrases like ""sick of _this_ life"" and ""walls are closing in and there's no escape"" get close to expressing a desire for the current suffering to end, which can be a component of suicidal ideation. The explicit mention of ""kill myself"" in this context of overwhelming hopelessness indicates that suicide is a thought the person is grappling with.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - This rules out 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and situation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
   - This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post is not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
   - The post is not 'Behavior' as no specific plan or method is mentioned.
   - The choice is between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'.
   - The 'Indicator' definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" This post *does* contain an explicit expression concerning suicide (""kill myself""). Therefore, it does not fit the primary definition of 'Indicator'.
   - The 'Indicator' definition also states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'."" Here, ""kill myself"" is a very explicit mention.
   - The 'Ideation' definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I don't want to kill myself, but..."" followed by a litany of despairing statements strongly suggests that suicidal thoughts are present, even if the person is resisting them or states they don't *want* to act on them. The ""but"" implies that the severity of the situation is making suicide a present thought or consideration. This constitutes an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The overwhelming hopelessness (""walls are closing in and there's no escape,"" ""sick of _this_ life"") further supports this. While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the context makes it clear that suicide is a topic on the person's mind due to their suffering.

Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' category because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and the context suggests the presence of suicidal thoughts, even if unwanted, without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts and ideations"", ""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""overwhelming and difficult"", ""can't get myself to do anything anymore"", ""in a rut"", ""weak and pathetic"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family"". This indicates a specific time and circumstance. However, no specific *method* (e.g., pills, weapon) or concrete preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The subsequent sentences show ambivalence: ""but I know I shouldn't I probably will hit up everyone... Or atleast do my hw"".
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts and ideations"", ""I want to kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. While a time (""tomorrow"") and a circumstance (""while my mom is out"") are mentioned, a specific method (how they plan to die, e.g., overdose, weapon) is not.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation like acquiring means or writing a note are mentioned.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The mention of ""tomorrow while my mom is out"" is a temporal aspect, but lacks the specificity of method or means required by the 'Behavior' category definition. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I want to die tomorrow"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""suicidal thoughts and ideations"", ""I want to kill myself"") and a desire to die (""I want to die tomorrow""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   'Behavior' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".
    *   The post mentions a time (""tomorrow"") and a condition (""while my mom is out""), which could be seen as part of a plan. However, it crucially lacks a *specific method* or mention of *preparations* (like acquiring means). The examples for 'Behavior' (medication, tools, specific locations like bridges) are more concrete than what is presented. The subsequent ambivalence (""but I know I shouldn't"", ""I probably will hit up everyone"") and the statement ""I just am too weak and pathetic to do it"" also reduce the certainty of a concrete, actionable plan.
    *   Given the lack of a specific method and the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure about an explicit plan, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category. The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and a desire to die, but the ""plan"" aspect is not sufficiently explicit in terms of method or means to qualify as 'Behavior'.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""yeet myself"" is a common euphemism for self-harm or suicide, especially in online contexts expressing distress. ""dead inside"" also indicates severe emotional numbness often associated with deep depression.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post is replete with strong emotional indicators: ""useless life,"" ""huge depressive episode,"" ""dead inside,"" ""still sad,"" ""still anhedonic,"" ""beyond saving,"" ""I just want to cry."" These point to significant hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Yeet myself"" is a general expression of wanting to self-destruct but does not specify a method (e.g., jumping from where, using what tool) or preparations.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (No) The word ""suicide"" or direct synonyms like ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes) The phrase ""I just want to ... yeet myself way too much,"" in the context of profound hopelessness (""useless life,"" ""dead inside,"" ""beyond saving""), is a direct expression of a desire to self-destruct or cease living. It's an explicit statement of wanting to perform an action that is commonly understood as suicidal.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While ""yeet myself"" is slang, the *desire* expressed (""I just want to..."") coupled with the common understanding of the phrase in such contexts makes the expression of wanting to die/self-destruct fairly clear. The 'Indicator' definition also states it ""lacks any ... direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" ""I just want to yeet myself"" is a direct indication of such thoughts/feelings.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (No) ""Yeet myself"" is vague and does not specify a particular method, tool, or location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (No) There's no mention of notes, acquiring means, or other preparations.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific plan or method is identified, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? (Current/future intentions) The phrase ""I just want to ... yeet myself"" expresses a current desire and potential future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? (No) The post does not describe any past suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and anhedonia. The key phrase is ""I just want to ... yeet myself way too much.""
    - It's not 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" ""I just want to yeet myself"" is a direct indication of suicidal feelings and a desire to act on them. The 'Ideation' definition states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Here, a desire is expressed.
    - It fits 'Ideation' because it ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I just want to ... yeet myself"" is an explicit expression of a desire to engage in a self-destructive act, implying a desire to not be alive or to escape unbearable pain. There is no specific plan.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because no specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. ""Yeet myself"" is too general.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because there's no description of a past attempt.

    The phrase ""I just want to ... yeet myself"" is an explicit expression of a desire to perform a self-destructive act. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' as an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""

God im such a fucking loser. i could really use someone to talk too. All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all. I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded."" This explicitly refers to a past suicide attempt and a current wish that the attempt had been successful.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""fucked up,"" ""loser,"" ""could really use someone to talk too,"" ""judgmental assholes."" These indicate distress, low self-esteem, loneliness, and feelings of being misunderstood.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No current plans or methods are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: ""I tried to end it once before."" This is a direct reference to a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end it"" in the context ""I tried to end it once before"" is a clear reference to suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded [in ending it]"" is a direct expression of wishing for death, linked to the past attempt.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for any current intention.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for any current intention.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It explicitly refers to a past event: ""I tried to end it once before."" It also expresses a current feeling related to that past event: ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded."" There are no current/future *plans* mentioned.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the phrase ""I tried to end it once before"" describes a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states, ""I tried to end it once before."" This directly aligns with the definition of **Attempt**: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The phrase ""tried to end it"" implies a concrete action was taken.
    The post also contains current ideation (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded""), but the definition for 'Attempt' notes: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While this post has current *ideation* rather than current *plans*, the primary classifying element is the description of a past attempt. The core definition of 'Attempt' is met by ""I tried to end it once before.""

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""bad panic attack"", ""fear""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states ""I just wanna kill myself,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. It's a current desire, not a past attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""give up and just get it over with"" strongly implies ending one's life or suicide, especially in the context of ""torture cycle"" and ""why keep going?"". ""Why keep going?"" also directly questions the continuation of life.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""screaming at me"", ""defeated"", ""torture cycle"", ""why keep going?"" indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""Every time I am back here"" suggests a recurring negative mental state, but it does not explicitly describe a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" are direct expressions of a desire for life to end or not to continue living. The ideation definition includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the desire to not be alive is expressed quite directly through strong euphemisms and direct questioning of continuing life. The 'ideation' definition's clause ""i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" seems to be met.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This is applicable as there is no plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""Now my brain is screaming at me"", ""why keep going?"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., ""give up and just get it over with,"" ""why keep going?""). This aligns with the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   It is not **Indicator** because the expressions go beyond general distress or vague feelings about death; they directly express a wish for life to end. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" is considered, but the ideation definition also allows for ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" as an explicit expression of suicidal feelings, which is present here.
    *   It is not **Behavior** because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.
    *   It is not **Attempt** because it describes current feelings and thoughts, not a past action of attempting suicide.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""annoyed"", ""feel stupid"", ""crying"", ""offended"". The user expresses significant distress.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" implies this.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that suicide is mentioned.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan is mentioned, so this supports 'ideation' if suicide is explicitly mentioned.

Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""planning to commit suicide"", ""I have to go"" (implying death/suicide), ""end it"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""genuinely upset"", ""My life won't ever be the same again"", ""can't change my circumstances"", ""I'll never be happy if I continue to live"", ""angry"", ""miserable"", ""sad"", ""mad"", ""no choice but to end it"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (like tools, locations, substances), or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" is present, but it's a general statement of intent without detailing *how*.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""commit suicide"", ""end it"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific methods or preparations are mentioned, it does not meet the 'behavior' criteria. The mention of ""planning"" is general.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current/future intentions (""planning to commit suicide"", ""I have to go"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""commit suicide"") and expresses a desire to die (""I have to go"", ""no choice but to end it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   While the post mentions ""planning to commit suicide,"" it does not provide any specific details about the plan, method, or preparations. According to the 'behavior' definition, it must include ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" also applies here. The plan is not explicit enough.
    *   There is no mention of past attempts, so it's not 'attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""attempting suicide"" is mentioned twice. ""I was so close to attempting suicide.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""regretting it immensely,"" ""not mentally stable,"" ""mortifying and embarrassing,"" ""want to rip my hair out,"" ""feel nauseous,"" ""dreading this,"" ""cannot stand living with my family."" Significant distress is evident.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations for the past near-attempt are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The post says ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" and ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide."" This indicates a near-attempt or strong consideration in the recent past, but not a completed action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""attempting suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post describes a recent past situation where the person was on the verge of attempting suicide, implying a desire to die *at that point in the past*. It doesn't explicitly state a *current* desire to die, but recounts intense past suicidal feelings.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan is mentioned for the past suicidal state, it would not be 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It primarily refers to a very recent past event (""I was so close to attempting suicide"") that led to the current situation (moving back home). The distress is current, but the suicidal action discussed was in the past and was averted.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, a *completed* attempt is not described. The wording ""so close to attempting"" and choosing an alternative (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"") implies the attempt did not happen. The definition of 'Attempt' requires ""A concrete action need to have happened"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** Not 'Attempt' because the post states ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" and implies the attempt was averted by choosing to reach out and move back home. A concrete action of attempting did not happen. The definition states, ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'.""
    *   **Behavior:** Not 'Behavior' because no specific plan or method for the near-attempt is mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The phrases ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" and ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" are explicit expressions of (recent past) suicidal thoughts/intent. Even though these thoughts are described as occurring in the recent past, the content of the post *is* an expression of them. No specific plan was mentioned for these past thoughts. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'. The post is recounting a period of intense suicidal ideation.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I cant take it"", ""pain makes me want to scream and break everything"", ""Its excruciating"" – indicates extreme distress, pain, and frustration.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post explicitly states, ""I wont kill myself of course,"" which is a direct negation of wanting to die or commit suicide.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The mention of suicide is clear, but the desire is clearly negated.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Not applicable as there is no expressed ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current feelings of pain and distress. The statement ""I wont kill myself"" refers to current/future intention regarding suicide (i.e., not to do it).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses extreme emotional pain (""I cant take it,"" ""pain makes me want to scream,"" ""excruciating"").
    Suicide is explicitly mentioned with the phrase ""kill myself.""
    However, this mention is immediately and explicitly negated: ""I wont kill myself of course.""
    The definition of **Ideation** states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."" and critically, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
    In this post, not only is a desire to die *not* expressed, but the intention to commit suicide is explicitly denied. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation'.
    The definition of **Indicator** states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings.""
    While ""kill myself"" is an ""explicit expression concerning suicide,"" the overall message is one of *not* having suicidal intent. The phrase ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" is met because the user explicitly states they *won't* kill themselves, indicating an absence of active suicidal feelings or intent. The post *does* contain ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" (or more accurately, extreme pain and frustration).
    Given the explicit negation of suicide and the rule from the Ideation definition (""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'""), the post falls into the 'Indicator' category. The mention of suicide is to dismiss it as an option, despite the intense pain. The primary signals are high distress and a stated lack of suicidal intent.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of current preparation (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The past event was thwarted by a lack of means.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit current plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a recent past event (""a few days ago i almost committed suicide"") and current intentions/thoughts (""yet i still consider"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? It describes an ""almost committed suicide"" event, which implies a very strong intent and near-action, but not a completed attempt because the means were lacking. The definition of 'Attempt' requires ""A concrete action need to have happened"". ""Almost committed"" means the concrete action did not happen.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""almost committed suicide"") and expresses a desire not to be alive (""probably wouldn't be alive right now"") and ongoing consideration of suicide (""yet i still consider""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The phrase ""almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" describes a past event that did not become a concrete action or completed attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   For 'Behavior', the post would need to mention a specific plan (method, preparations) for a current or future act. While the past ""almost committed"" implies thinking about it, no specific method is detailed, and the current ""still consider"" does not come with a plan. The rule is ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
    *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post. There are explicit suicidal thoughts (""almost committed suicide"", ""still consider"") and desire not to be alive, but no specific current plan is detailed. The past ""almost committed"" event, while intense, did not materialize into an attempt due to lack of means, and it serves as a strong expression of past suicidal ideation that has carried over into current consideration.

165,suicide with me. can anyone suicide with me together. for those want to suicide too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide with me"", ""suicide with me together"", ""want to suicide too"". All are explicit mentions of suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied distress, seeking companionship for suicide.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method, location, or preparation is mentioned. The post is about the desire to commit suicide and seeking others to do it with, but not *how* to do it.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide with me"", ""want to suicide too"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, directly through the repeated use of ""suicide"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post asks if anyone wants to ""suicide with me"" but doesn't specify *how*.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, beyond expressing the intent and seeking others. This is not preparation in terms of acquiring means or making concrete arrangements for a method.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific plan or method is mentioned, this leans towards 'ideation'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""suicide with me"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die (""suicide with me""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Behavior' requires mentioning a plan or specific method/preparations. This post expresses a strong desire and even an invitation to others, but it lacks any detail about *how* the suicide would be carried out (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, location). The act of ""seeking someone to suicide with"" is a strong indicator of ideation, but it is not, in itself, a *plan* as defined (specific method, tools, location).
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category as it covers ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan"".

166,"I want to kms but nothing is ready and I'm scared for some reason. Hello. I just got home from work and I really want to hang myself right now. I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kms"" (kill myself), ""hang myself"", ""kill myself"", ""killing myself"", ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice’ hung"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""can't stop thinking about killing myself"", ""It is what I deserve"", ""don't feel like I can wait any longer"", ""scared of failing"", ""burden"". Strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, and being a burden are present.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Method: ""hang myself"" is explicitly stated.
        *   Means: ""rope"" is explicitly mentioned.
        *   Preparations: The user mentions ideal preparations they *haven't* done (""apartment packed up"", ""resigned from my job"", ""money set aside""). However, critically, the user states, ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice’ hung for a minute or two"". This is a significant preparatory action or rehearsal.
    *   References to past attempts: No clear mention of a distinct, completed past attempt. The ""'practice' hung"" is part of the current suicidal crisis.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kms"", ""hang myself"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to kms"", ""I really want to hang myself right now"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"" using a ""rope"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. While the user states some ideal preparations are not done, the act of ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice’ hung for a minute or two"" constitutes a direct preparation and engagement with the chosen method and means. This is more than just ideation; it's an action taken.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and immediate future intentions (""right now"", ""can't wait any longer"", ""trying again"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No distinct past attempt is described. The ""practice hung"" is presented as part of the current crisis.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post includes a specific method (""hang myself"") and means (""rope"").
    *   Crucially, the post describes a preparatory action: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice’ hung for a minute or two"". This action, even if termed 'practice', involves engaging with the lethal means and method.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... tools/weapons (e.g. ...ropes) suitable to end ones life...).""
    *   The mention of the rope and the act of ""practice hung"" fits the criteria for 'Behavior' as it demonstrates a specific method, access to means, and a preparatory action. It goes beyond 'Ideation', which is defined as ""without any specific plan"" or where specific ideas are present but no preparatory actions or imminent intent with means is described. The ""practice hung"" is a clear step towards carrying out the plan.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because the ""practice hung"" is described as part of the current crisis and planning, not as a historical, failed attempt.

The act of ""practice hung"" is a significant behavioral component.

I finally got confirmation that my fiancé doesn't really care. It's finally fucking time. I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun. I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead. Then he will survive, then he won't need to work out a way to keep two people afloat with only his job. He'll only need to focus on himself and I'll finally be at peace. I told him today. I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job.

I don't want to be here any more.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains multiple strong indicators: ""finally doing it"" (repeated, implying suicide), ""violently suicidal"", ""I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead"", ""I just want to fucking die"", ""I don't want to be here any more"". The phrase ""suicidal ideation"" is also mentioned in reference to the past.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong emotional distress is evident: ""sobbing for the last few hours"", ""overwhelmed"", feeling like a ""fucking failure"", feeling like a ""burden"", ""haven't stopped crying"", ""depression"". Hopelessness and despair are pervasive.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions, ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun. I don't know though..."". This mentions a method (gun) but frames it as a past thought and expresses current uncertainty about the method and the exact plan. There are no mentions of preparations like acquiring a weapon or writing a note (other than the post itself).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit past attempts are described. ""My suicidal ideation"" is mentioned as something the mother didn't understand, referring to a state of mind, not an action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""violently suicidal"", ""suicidal ideation"" and strong euphemisms like ""finally doing it"" in context of wanting to die).
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead"", ""I just want to fucking die"", ""I don't want to be here any more"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""gun"" is mentioned as a method the poster has ""always thought"" about.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring the gun).
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The post explicitly states, ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it"" and ""I don't know though"" after mentioning the gun. This indicates a lack of a definite, current plan, despite mentioning a method as a past thought. The uncertainty about the plan is explicit.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I'm finally doing it"", ""I'm going to go through with it"", ""I'll die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not an **Indicator** because suicide and the desire to die are explicitly mentioned.
    *   The post is not an **Attempt** because it does not describe a past suicide attempt.
    *   The choice is between **Ideation** and **Behavior**.
        *   **Ideation** is defined as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings without a specific plan.
        *   **Behavior** requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan or specific method with some form of explicit planning.
    *   The post expresses very strong suicidal intent (""I'm finally doing it"", ""I'm going to go through with it""). It mentions a method (""gun"") but immediately follows with ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it"" and ""I don't know though"". This explicit statement of not knowing the exact method or plan for the current intent means there isn't an ""explicit plan"" as required for 'Behavior'. The mention of a gun is more of a contemplation or past thought rather than a current, decided-upon plan.
    *   Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and the explicit statement of not knowing the plan, **Ideation** is the most appropriate category. The desire and intent to die are very high, but a specific plan for the current suicidal action is not articulated.

I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""doesn't want me dead,"" ""full intentions to end things.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""apathetic about my existing,"" ""want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb,"" ""at the edge,"" ""pathetic."" These indicate significant distress and a desire to escape.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This indicates a specific location (mountains) and a preparatory action (driving there).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The post describes a very recent action (""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"") which was a significant step towards suicide, but the person then states, ""I don't think I'm going to do it."" This could be seen as an aborted attempt or a very serious preparatory behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end things"" in the context of driving to the mountains with ""full intentions"" and the phrase ""doesn't want me dead"" strongly implies suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""full intentions to end things.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? A specific location (""mountains"") is mentioned, which is a common element in suicide plans. The act of ""driving up to the mountains"" with intent is a clear plan and preparation. While the exact method to be used *at* the mountains isn't detailed, the location itself is part of the plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" is a significant preparatory action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent past action (""I just finished driving up..."") and current feelings/intentions (""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" ""want to sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb,"" ""at the edge"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The action of driving to the mountains with ""full intentions to end things"" is described. The person states they don't think they will go through with it *now*, implying the act of suicide itself was not completed. This is a description of a very recent, serious preparatory behavior that stopped short of a completed or initiated suicidal act.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not an 'Indicator' because suicide (""end things"") is explicitly mentioned in context.
    *   It is more than 'Ideation' because there's a specific plan and preparatory action taken (""driving up to the mountains"").
    *   It fits 'Behavior' because it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (""full intentions to end things"") AND ""mentions... a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... suitable locations...)."" Driving to the mountains with intent is a clear preparation involving a suitable location.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because, while a ""concrete action"" (driving to the mountains) happened, the definition of 'Attempt' (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)"") implies the suicidal act itself was initiated. The post suggests the person stopped *before* initiating the final suicidal act (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). The action described is a very serious preparatory behavior rather than a past attempt where the self-harming act was carried out (even if unsuccessfully).

The post describes explicit suicidal ideation (""full intentions to end things"") coupled with a specific plan and preparatory action (driving to the mountains). This falls squarely into the 'Behavior' category.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific named method (like ""gun"" or ""pills""), but ""strapped in"" strongly suggests a method is in place or being enacted. ""Go out the way I want"" implies a chosen method.

    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. However, ""Preps being made"" and ""The date was set"" are explicit statements about planning and preparation. ""Strapped in"" further points to a method being engaged.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""I'm ready"", ""Preps being made"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I'm ready to die"").
    *   It also explicitly mentions preparations (""Preps being made"") and a set timeline (""The date was set a while ago"").
    *   ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" suggests a method is actively being engaged or is imminent.
    *   The definition of **Behavior** is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by).""
    *   ""Preps being made"" and ""The date was set"" clearly fall under ""preparations taken"" and ""explicit planning"". ""Strapped in"" points towards a method.

    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""pls let me never wake up"" is a clear expression of wanting to die. ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" suggests finality. ""its working!"" is ambiguous but in context could relate to an action leading to death.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The desire to ""never wake up"" strongly indicates hopelessness and a wish for death.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""its working!"" hints at an ongoing process, but no specific method (pills, weapon, location) or preparation (note, acquiring means) is explicitly stated.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""its working!"" does not specify any tool, location, substance, or method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" could be seen as a form of goodbye, which is a preparation. However, ""its working!"" is the most suggestive part regarding a plan, but it lacks specificity about *what* is working.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The phrase ""its working!"" is suggestive of an action, but because it doesn't specify the method, it's not an *explicit* plan. The uncertainty about whether this constitutes an explicit plan (as per the definition requiring specific methods or preparations) leads to leaning towards 'ideation'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""hopefully this is my last post,"" ""pls let me never wake up,"" and ""its working!"" all refer to current or immediate future intentions/actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die (""pls let me never wake up""). This moves it beyond 'indicator'.
    *   The post mentions ""its working!"", which could imply a plan in action. However, the definition of 'behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)"". ""its working!"" does not explicitly state the method or plan.
    *   The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Given the ambiguity of ""its working!"" and the lack of a *specific* method mentioned, there is uncertainty about an explicit plan.

    *   Given the strong implication and desire to die, this leans beyond 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes: ""42 unnamed pills"", ""old antidepressants"", ""allergy medicine"". The method is taking pills.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes: ""i have 42 unnamed pills"", ""i also have some allergy medicine"". The person states they possess the means. A timeframe is also given: ""tonight"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""tonight im gonna do it"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The post mentions past *statements* of intent (""saying im gonna do it but then i never do""), but not a description of a past *action* taken to attempt suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""im so ready to die"") and a clear intention to act (""tonight im gonna do it"").
    *   It specifies a method (pills: antidepressants, allergy medicine) and indicates preparation (having the pills).
    *   This fulfills the criteria for 'Behavior': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs...)"".
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicidal intent is clearly expressed.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method and preparation (having the pills) and a timeframe (""tonight"") are mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because it describes a future plan, not a past action. The mention of past inaction (""never do"") doesn't constitute a past attempt.

I don't feel like anyone loves me or even likes me, except maybe my parents but I don't feel like it goes beyond loving me just cause I'm their kid. They don't actually love me for me. And even if they do, I don't feel like I can open up and talk with them about how I'm feeling and about my problems. I'm just to anxious to do it. I'm very lonely. I've only ever had a friend once in my life, but it didn't continue after third grade. I wish I had someone I was I'm;octant to. Someone I could trust and openly talk to about anything, who made me feel safe and wanted. I'm tire of being an unwanted nuisance to everyone around me. I want to go somewhere where I feel like I belong. More and more often it feels like the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to be done"", ""kill myself"".

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a desire to ""be done."" These are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""check out"" (euphemism for dying/suicide), ""suicide"" explicitly mentioned.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""running on nothing but shear spite"", ""really want to check out"", ""can not really express how much I want to check out"", ""spite has its limits"". This indicates strong desire to die, though framed with ""spite"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post discusses the *desire* and the *reasons* for holding on (spite) and the diminishing nature of that reason.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""It is not that I have any moral problem with suicide at this point"").

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and contains direct expressions of wanting to die (""check out""). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. It's not describing a past attempt. Based on the definitions:
    - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a desire to die is expressed.
    - Fits 'Ideation' because it ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    - Not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan or method.
    - Not 'Attempt' because it refers to current feelings, not a past action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i cant do this anymore"", ""im going to do it"", ""im done"" strongly imply an intention to end life. The phrase ""i hope everyone finds something to live for"" juxtaposes with the poster's apparent lack of such a reason.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""im in so much pain and i cant handle it anymore"", ""i cant. i cant."" clearly indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""im going to do it"" but does not specify *how*, *when* (other than implicitly soon), or *where*. No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned. The post itself could be seen as a farewell note (""thank you to the people i met thru this sub"").
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. ""i cant do this anymore"", ""im done"", and ""im going to do it"" are direct expressions of wanting to end life, especially in the context of overwhelming pain.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It's quite clear there's an expression of wanting to die/end things, so it's beyond 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No. The post says ""im going to do it"" but gives no details on the method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): The post acts as a farewell note (""thank you to the people i met thru this sub""). However, no mention of acquiring means.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': While ""im going to do it"" indicates intent to act, the definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method"". Since no specific method is mentioned, it leans away from 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current/imminent future intentions (""im going to do it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator**: This is ruled out because phrases like ""im going to do it"" and ""im done"" in the context of extreme pain are explicit expressions concerning ending one's life, not just general distress.
    *   **Ideation**: This category fits. The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""i cant do this anymore"", ""im done"", ""im going to do it""). It is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"" in terms of method. The desire to end life is strong and explicit.
    *   **Behavior**: This category requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". While ""im going to do it"" is a very strong statement of intent, it does not mention a *specific method* or *explicit planning* regarding means. The farewell note aspect is a preparation, but the definition emphasizes ""specific method"". The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies.
    *   **Attempt**: This is ruled out as the post refers to current/future intentions, not a past action.

The post clearly expresses a desire to die and an intention to act (""im going to do it""). However, it lacks the ""specific method"" component required for the 'Behavior' category. Therefore, it falls under 'Ideation' as it's an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, without a specified plan/method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""a lot of stress,"" ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life,"" ""why not"" (suggests hopelessness, resignation).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post asks ""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"". This is an inquiry about methods, indicating a desire to find a plan, but not stating a specific chosen method or preparation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""kill myself,"" ""it would just be a lot easier"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The post *asks for* methods (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?""). It does not state a specific method the person has chosen or possesses.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Seeking a method is a step towards preparation, but the post doesn't mention concrete preparations like acquiring means or writing a note.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The post is asking for information to form a plan, rather than stating an existing plan or chosen method. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""mentions... a plan... like a specific method or preparations taken"". Asking for a method is not the same as mentioning a specific method they intend to use or preparations they have made.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and expresses a desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan"".
        *   'Behavior': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
    *   The post expresses strong suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. It asks for a method, which is a step beyond vague ideation. However, it does not *mention* a specific method the poster has decided upon, nor does it detail preparations taken (e.g., acquiring pills, a weapon, writing a note). It is seeking information to *formulate* a plan.
    *   Since no specific plan or method is *mentioned as chosen or prepared*, and the rule is ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" the post fits 'Ideation'. The act of asking for a method, while serious, does not equate to ""mentioning a specific method"" they have as part of an existing plan.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""die,"" ""suicide,"" ""end it with pills."" It describes the process and negative effects of overdosing.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The author does not express personal emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair. The tone is informative and cautionary, aimed at dissuading others from a specific suicide method.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post describes a specific method (""overdosing,"" ""pills"") in detail, but as a warning against it, not as the author's personal plan or preparation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: There are no references to past attempts by the author.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (from the author)? No. The author is discussing suicide in the context of warning others, not expressing personal desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdosing"" with ""pills.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation (by the author)? No. The author is describing the method to discourage its use by others, not preparing to use it themselves.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions (of the author)? The post describes a potential future action (overdosing) for someone considering it, but not as the author's own current or future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described (by the author)? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The primary rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    The author discusses suicide and a specific method in detail. However, they are not expressing any personal suicidal thoughts, feelings, desires, plans, or past attempts. The post is structured as a warning to others about the dangers and unpleasantness of a particular suicide method.

    *   **Attempt:** Not applicable, as there is no description of a past suicide attempt by the author.
    *   **Behavior:** Not applicable. This requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts *and* also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" *by the author*. The author is not expressing their own suicidal thoughts or a plan for themselves.
    *   **Ideation:** Not applicable. This requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" *from the author*. The author does not express such desires.

    This leaves **Indicator**. The definition of Indicator states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" This part seems contradictory at first, as the post *is* explicitly about suicide. However, it continues: ""There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The crucial part is that there is *no indication of the author's personal suicidal thoughts or feelings*. The post discusses suicide as a topic, but does not reflect a suicide risk for the author. Given that the risk assessment is *only* for the author, and the author is not expressing personal suicidality, the post does not fall into Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt for the author. Therefore, despite the explicit discussion of suicide, the post is best classified as 'Indicator' because it does not indicate suicidal risk *for the person writing the post*. The mention of suicide is in a descriptive/warning context, not a personal expression of suicidality.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""im gonna do it the the future"", ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this"". ""It"" in this context clearly refers to suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""mental health issues"", ""no motivation to keep on living"", ""fed up of this"". Expresses hopelessness regarding the future, despite claiming to be ""good rn"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, phrases like ""im gonna do it"" and ""ill do it"" in the context of ""no motivation to keep on living"" are explicit expressions of suicidal intent, even if the word ""suicide"" itself isn't used. The intent is clear.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of future suicidal intent (""im gonna do it the the future"", ""ill do it when im fed up of this"") and a desire to not be alive (""no motivation to keep on living""). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It's more than 'Indicator' because suicide is clearly referenced as a future action. It's not 'Behavior' because there's no plan. It's not 'Attempt' because it refers to the future, not the past.

    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong negative emotions are present: ""fucking hate my parents"", ""psychologically tortured"". This indicates significant distress and dissatisfaction with life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses extreme dissatisfaction with being born and the quality of life (""psychologically tortured"") but does not explicitly state a desire to die or not be alive. It's a strong expression of suffering and resentment towards parents for their existence.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Given the absence of explicit suicidal statements, this rule supports 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as 'ideation' criteria are not met.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress, anger, and a feeling of being ""psychologically tortured"" due to the circumstances of their birth and upbringing. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The definition of ""Indicator"" states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post describes a dream about ""mass murdering people"" and ""slicing up as many people as they could."" This refers to violence against others in a dream, not self-inflicted harm or suicide by the poster. No mention of the poster's own death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The poster mentions ""severe panic attack,"" ""felt like a real threat,"" ""absolutely terrified me,"" ""sheer panic,"" ""realness of it,"" ""absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake,"" ""anxious to sleep."" These indicate significant distress, fear, and anxiety related to the dream.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to suicide or self-harm by the poster. The methods described (""slicing up"") are by the figures in the dream against others.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The poster is distressed by the dream and wants to avoid such dreams and the anxiety they cause.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that suicide is not mentioned.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No (for suicide by the poster).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No (for suicide by the poster).
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there's no ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a recent dream and current distress/anxiety resulting from it. It does not refer to any suicidal intentions (past, current, or future).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post describes a disturbing dream and the resulting panic and anxiety. There are no mentions of suicide, suicidal thoughts, wanting to die, self-harm, plans for suicide, or past attempts by the poster. The distress is clearly linked to the content of the dream and its vividness. This falls under ""general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? For past events, ""overdosed"" is mentioned. For current/future intentions, no specific method is detailed for the current desire to ""do it"" or ""end this suffering"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not for a current attempt.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. ""ive overdosed twice"" refers to past events. ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" and ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" refer to current feelings and potential future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"". This is a concrete action from the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states, ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" This is a clear description of past suicide attempts. The definition of ""Attempt"" is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    The post mentions past attempts (overdoses) and also expresses current suicidal ideation (""end this suffering"", ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it""). According to the rule, if past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans/ideation, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. The mention of ""overdosed twice"" is a concrete past action.

182,I thought I was getting better. for the past few weeks I've been happy just to be spending time with my partner without any bad days. I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again. I've run out of meds and I asked for an urgent refill a few days ago but my doctors/pharmacy never got back to me. I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal again"" is a direct mention of suicidal feelings.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""low mood"", ""scared to stress him"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. Running out of meds is a stressor, not a plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""suicidal again"" implies previous suicidal feelings, but not necessarily a specific attempt.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""suicidal again"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""suicidal again"" implies a desire to not be alive or to end one's life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Not unclear.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan identified.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: ""I'm suicidal again"" refers to current feelings/intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No. ""Suicidal again"" implies a recurrence of suicidal feelings, not necessarily a past attempt.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal again."" This is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts. There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. There is no description of a past attempt. Therefore, the category is 'ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains ""I want to die more than ever"" and ""I can't have this life it's too painful.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses strong negative emotions: ""anxious"", ""doubt everything"", ""making everything worse"", ""painful"", ""worthless"", ""Everytime I try I fail. It's just too hard."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not explicitly used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die more than ever"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. ""I can't have this life it's too painful"" also implies a desire for life to end due to pain.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. It is quite clear that there is a direct expression of wanting to die. The definition of 'Ideation' includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings. The 'Indicator' definition states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Since a desire to die is expressed, this points away from 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan is mentioned, it is not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""now I want to die more than ever"" refers to current feelings and intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, past attempts are not described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for posts lacking explicit expressions concerning suicide or a desire to die. The post explicitly states, ""I want to die more than ever."" The 'Indicator' definition also notes, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Since a desire to die is expressed, this category is not appropriate.
    *   **Ideation:** This category is for content with ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post contains ""I want to die more than ever,"" which is an explicit desire to not be alive. No specific plan is mentioned. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mention of a plan or self-harming behavior. The post lacks any mention of a plan or specific method. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   **Attempt:** This category is for descriptions of past suicide attempts. The post does not describe any past attempts. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die more than ever"") but does not mention any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide by hanging"", ""tied the noose"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""still not sure"" (implies consideration), seeking information about the experience (""long and painful"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""suicide by hanging"" (method), ""ive alr tied the noose"" (preparation/tool).
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide by hanging"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The context of asking about a suicide method and having prepared for it strongly implies suicidal intent, even if not phrased as ""I want to die.""

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""ive alr tied the noose"". This is a clear sign of preparation with a specific tool.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""im still not sure"" implies a decision is being contemplated for the present/near future).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions suicide (""suicide by hanging""). It also details a specific method (""hanging"") and a preparatory step (""ive alr tied the noose""). This fulfills the criteria for 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (implied by researching a method and preparing for it) and mentions a specific plan/method and preparation. It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method and preparation are mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' as it refers to current/future consideration, not a past event. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is present, so 'ideation' is appropriate if explicit suicide mention is confirmed.

    *   There are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" is a clear reference to wanting to end one's life.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post is filled with strong negative emotions: ""i hate my dad"", ""i hate my family so much"", ""i hate him so much"", ""i hate everything"". This indicates significant distress and potential hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" itself is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""i just wanna end it"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life, which is equivalent to wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The phrase ""end it"" in this context is a common and widely understood euphemism for suicide, making it a clear expression of wanting to die, not unclear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains a clear expression of wanting to end one's life (""i just wanna end it""). This fulfills the criteria for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" as stated in the 'Ideation' definition. However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because ""i just wanna end it"" is an explicit expression of a desire to die, not just general distress or a vague feeling about death.
    *   It is 'Ideation' because it expresses a desire to die without a specific plan.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned.

Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""brink of suicide"" but in the context of offering an alternative or referring to past situations. It's a discussion *about* suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The author mentions past feelings of ""couldn't cope."" However, the current state is described as ""a functional member of society at the moment.""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No plans or methods for suicide are mentioned by the author for their current self.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The author says ""the road has saved me in the past"" and refers to occasions where they ""felt like I couldn't cope."" This implies they were in a dire situation, possibly considering suicide, but it does not explicitly state that a suicide *attempt* was made. ""Saved me"" suggests prevention of a negative outcome, not recovery from an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""brink of suicide.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not for the author's current self. The author states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment."" The mentions of suicide are in a general advisory context or refer to past feelings.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to past events (""occasions in my life,"" ""saved me in the past"") and offers general advice. The author's current state is explicitly non-suicidal (""functional member of society"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Feeling like one ""couldn't cope"" or being ""saved"" by an alternative action (going hobo) is not a description of a concrete suicide attempt. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide.""
    *   However, the author does not express any *current* suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. They state they are currently ""a functional member of society.""
    *   The 'Ideation' definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Since the author expresses no current desire to die, this rule points towards 'Indicator'.
    *   The 'Attempt' category is not applicable as no past concrete suicide attempt is described. Being ""saved"" from a bad situation by choosing an alternative path is not an attempt.
    *   The 'Behavior' category is not applicable as there's no mention of current plans or methods.
    *   The 'Indicator' definition says ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" This seems to conflict at first, as ""suicide"" is mentioned. However, the subsequent part ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings [of the author for themselves currently]"" and the guiding rule from the 'Ideation' definition (""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"") suggest that if the author isn't expressing *their own current* suicidal ideation, it falls into 'Indicator', even if the topic of suicide is discussed. The post is about suicide as a topic and past struggles, not a present expression of suicidal intent by the author.

Therefore, based on the author not expressing a current desire to die, despite mentioning suicide in a reflective/advisory context, the post is best classified as 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""can't go on anymore"", ""then end it"". ""End it"" in this context is a clear euphemism for suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""life has been getting worse"", ""addiction"", ""drunk"", ""so lonely"", ""fucked up my life"", ""miss being happy"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk... and then end it"". This indicates a timeframe (""tonight""), a preparatory action/state (""be drunk""), and a location (implied ""in my basement"" where the person currently is). The post also has a farewell tone (""I love you all so much""), which can be seen as a form of a note.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""end it"" in this context is an explicit reference to ending one's life. (Yes, effectively).
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""can't go on anymore"" and ""then end it"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** A specific lethal method (e.g., pills, weapon) for ""end it"" is not explicitly stated. However, the plan includes getting ""drunk"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes. The statement ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk... and then end it"" indicates a plan for the immediate future (""tonight"") and a preparatory action (""be drunk""). Being in the basement and getting drunk are preparations. The post itself (""I love you all so much"") acts like a farewell note.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** The plan involves a timeframe (""tonight""), a preparatory action (""be drunk""), a location (""basement""), and the act (""end it""). This is more than just ideation. The definition of 'behavior' includes ""preparations taken"". Getting drunk is a preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current and immediate future intentions (""tonight"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""can't go on anymore"", ""then end it"").
    *   It goes beyond ideation because it outlines a plan of action for the immediate future: ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk... and then end it"".
    *   This plan includes:
        *   Timing: ""tonight"".
        *   Preparation/State: ""be drunk"".
        *   Location: ""in my basement"" (current location).
        *   Action: ""then end it"".
    *   The farewell ""I love you all so much"" further supports the seriousness and immediacy.
    *   While the exact *means* of ""end it"" is not specified, the ""preparations taken"" (getting drunk) and the stated plan to act ""tonight"" fit the definition of 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Behavior' states ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Getting drunk is a preparation, and ""tonight... end it"" is an explicit plan to act.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end my life"" is a clear mention of suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: The question itself implies a desire to die, though specific emotions like hopelessness aren't explicitly stated.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"" are specific substances (methods). The phrase ""I have 800mg codeine"" suggests preparation (acquiring means).
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""800mg codeine"" and ""ibuprofen"" (lethal medication/drugs).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have 800mg codeine"" indicates possession of means. The question is about the efficacy of these means for suicide.

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Will I be able to..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions suicide (""end my life""). It also details specific methods/substances (""800mg codeine,"" ""ibuprofen"") and indicates possession (""I have 800mg codeine""), which constitutes a plan and preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""resisting the desire to end"", ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"". While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""desire to end"" and running out of reasons to live are strong indicators of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):** ""failed everything"", ""wasted it"", ""im not happy or enjoying anythnig"", ""this cant be it i cant live like this"", ""nobody fucking understands me"", ""suffer everyday"", ""never been happy since birth"". Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and suffering.

    *   **Check for references to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No):** No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No):** Yes. Phrases like ""resisting the desire to end"", ""everyday i ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"", ""i fucking cant do this anymore"", ""i cant live like this for the rest of my life"", ""i cant stand being here any other moment"" are direct expressions of wanting to not be alive or for life to end.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** The desire to not be alive is quite clearly expressed. The 'Ideation' definition includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". This condition is met. The rule for 'Indicator' states ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" However, this post goes beyond general dissatisfaction by explicitly mentioning a ""desire to end"" and running out of reasons to live.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances):** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means):** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** Not applicable as no plan is suggested.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?:** Current feelings and intentions (""i fucking cant do this anymore"", ""i cant live like this for the rest of my life"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?:** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die or for life to end (e.g., ""resisting the desire to end"", ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive""). This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    While the word ""suicide"" itself is not used, the ""desire to end"" and the statement ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"" are direct expressions of suicidal feelings.
    It is not 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings"". This post *does* have direct indications of suicidal thoughts.
    It is not 'Behavior' because no specific plan or method is mentioned.
    It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The question itself (""How do you tell the people you love..."") implies distress and a serious contemplation of suicide. ""SMI"" likely stands for Serious Mental Illness, which can be a contributing factor to distress.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""commit suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""probably commit suicide eventually"" is a direct expression of contemplating future suicide, which implies a desire (or perceived inevitability) to not be alive at some point.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The word ""eventually"" does not constitute a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""will probably commit suicide eventually"" refers to future intentions or expectations.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide."" This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It expresses a thought/feeling about future suicide (""will probably commit suicide eventually""). This aligns with ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings.""
    *   There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it contains explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""losing grip"", ""stupid financial mistakes"", ""haunt me"", ""problems hidden"", ""just getting worse"", ""don't know who to turn to"", ""can't stop crying"", ""can't cope with his own mistakes"", ""cry out for him to show me a solution"". Strong distress, hopelessness, feeling overwhelmed.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""end myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes (""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"").
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Not unclear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan identified.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions/thoughts (""voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself""). This clearly points away from 'Indicator'. There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations, which rules out 'Behavior'. The post does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, the most fitting category is 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post says, ""maybe i don't need to die."" This is a mention of ""die"" in relation to the self.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post mentions ""abusive ex,"" ""mental health stuff,"" and ""not okay right now,"" indicating past/current distress. However, it also expresses ""a hopeful thought,"" ""i can be okay,"" and ""i hope i can have that one day,"" indicating a shift towards hope.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"" is not used. The word ""die"" is used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" is a contemplation about *not* needing to die, which implies the thought of dying was present, but it's not a current expression of wanting to die. It's framed as a hopeful possibility of not needing to.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The lack of a direct expression of wanting to die leans away from Ideation as per its core definition.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Not applicable for moving to 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" is a current thought, reflecting on a potential past or fading consideration, and looking towards a future where dying isn't necessary. The overall tone is future-oriented and hopeful.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains the phrase ""maybe i don't need to die."" This explicitly mentions ""die"" in relation to the self.
    *   The **Indicator** definition states: ""May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide."" ""Die"" is mentioned, not ""suicide."" The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" is more specific than a ""vague feeling,"" it's a direct thought.
    *   The **Ideation** definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."" Crucially, it also states: ""**If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.**""
    *   The post ""maybe i don't need to die"" does *not* express a current desire to die or not be alive. In fact, it expresses a hope or a thought *against* the necessity of dying.
    *   Because there is no expressed desire to die, and the Ideation definition explicitly says to classify such cases as 'indicator', this rule must be followed.
    *   While the mention of ""die"" is explicit, the *intent* or *desire* required for Ideation is absent. The post is about hope and a potential positive turn away from darker thoughts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""dont wanna die rn"" - explicitly states not wanting to die *right now*.
        *   ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" - inquiry about lethality of a substance.
        *   ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" - explicit mention of suicidal thoughts.
        *   ""i will do it anyway"" - refers to taking the pills.
    *   **Emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):**
        *   ""bored"" - mentioned as a trigger for suicidal thoughts.
        *   ""i just wanna be calm rn"" - desire for calmness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   Mentions ""3 xanax pills"" (specific substance and quantity).
        *   States intent to take them: ""i will do it anyway.""
    *   **References to past attempts:**
        *   No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No)**
        *   Yes, ""suicidal thoughts are always there.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No)**
        *   Yes, ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" implies a desire (even if recurring/passive) to not be alive or to end one's life. ""i dont wanna die rn"" negates immediate intent but doesn't negate the presence of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.**
        *   It's clear that suicidal thoughts are present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances)**
        *   Yes, ""3 xanax pills"" (substance).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?**
        *   The post states an intention to act: ""i will do it anyway"" (referring to taking the pills). This indicates preparation or imminent action with a specific means.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.**
        *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts are always there"").
        *   It also mentions a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and an intent to use it (""i will do it anyway""), along with an inquiry about its lethality (""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"").
        *   The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" ""3 xanax pills"" is a specific means/method.
        *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs...).""
        *   Taking 3 Xanax pills with the intent ""i will do it anyway"" while having suicidal thoughts and asking about their lethal potential can be considered ""exhibiting self-harming behavior"" and ""mentioning a plan"" (by exploring the outcome of a specific intended action with a method).
        *   Even though the user says ""i dont wanna die rn,"" the combination of ongoing suicidal thoughts, a specific method, intent to use the method, and inquiry about its lethality points towards 'Behavior'. The action of taking the pills in this context is a behavior linked to suicidal risk.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?**
        *   Current/immediate future intentions (""i will do it anyway,"" ""rn"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?**
        *   No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   No past attempt is described, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is for thoughts without a specific plan. 'Behavior' is for thoughts *with* a plan/method or self-harming behavior.
    *   The post includes:
        1.  Explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts are always there"").
        2.  A specific method (""3 xanax pills"").
        3.  An intention to use this method (""i will do it anyway"").
        4.  An inquiry about the method's lethality (""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"").
    *   The Ideation definition itself directs to 'Behavior' if specific methods are mentioned: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   The act of intending to take specific pills and asking about their lethal potential, in the context of ongoing suicidal thoughts, constitutes more than just ideation; it's an engagement with a specific method and a potential self-harming behavior. The ""i dont wanna die rn"" complicates the *intent* for suicide with this specific act, but the behavior itself (taking pills, asking about death, having suicidal thoughts) is high-risk and involves a specific method.

        *   For self-harm: Actively seeking ""places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" - this is seeking methods/locations for self-harm.
        *   For suicide: ""kill myself"" is stated as an intention, but no specific method for suicide itself is detailed in the post, though the intent is conditional.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

        *   For suicide: No specific method for ""kill myself"" is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): Seeking information on how to self-harm (""places on the body"") can be considered a preparatory step or information gathering for self-harm. No other preparations mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':
        The definition of ""Behavior"" states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts **and also** mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide **or exhibits self-harming behavior**.""
        The post contains:
        1.  Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts: ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself.""
        2.  The query ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" is an active step towards self-harm, seeking a method/location. This constitutes planning or seeking means for self-harming behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""i will wait until I can kill myself"", ""does anyone know what places... can be self harmed"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") which is a suicidal thought.
    Additionally, the post includes a direct inquiry about how to self-harm (""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing""). This inquiry for methods/locations for self-harm is a form of planning or actively seeking to enable self-harming behavior.
    According to the ""Behavior"" definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts **and also** mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide **or exhibits self-harming behavior**.""
    The post fulfills both conditions:
    -   Explicit suicidal thoughts: ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself.""
    -   Exhibits self-harming behavior (by seeking methods/planning): ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing.""
    Therefore, the category is ""Behavior"".

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself soon"", ""strong urge to [kill myself]"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""don't care"" (referring to others), ""wish i wasn't even born"", ""life is fucking stupid"" (expressions of hopelessness, despair).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""soon"" indicates a timeframe but not a specific method or preparation. No tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and a desire to die (""kill myself soon"", ""wish i wasn't even born""). However, it does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. ""Soon"" is an indicator of intent and timing but not a plan in itself. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there's no mention of a specific plan or method.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because it refers to current/future intentions, not a past action.

    *   Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I can never get the nerve to jump""), a cry for help or intervention (""maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly mentions a method (""jump"") and a specific location (""ledge of a hospital parking garage"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""tried committing suicide"" (mentioned for the past)
        *   ""die in combat"" (past desire, framed as an alternative to suicide)
        *   ""multiple attempts on my life"" (past)
        *   ""my death seems to ultimate answer"" (current ideation)
        *   ""searching about ways to kill myself"" (current behavior/planning)
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):
        *   ""struggling with depression""
        *   ""life is going absolutely shitty""
        *   ""felt hopeless""
        *   ""hated myself""
        *   ""mentally exhausting""
        *   ""all I caused was problems""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Past attempt: ""using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope"" - specific method.
        *   Current: ""searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"" - this is an active preparation/search for a method.
    *   Check for references to past attempts:
        *   ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger...""
        *   ""I have multiple attempts on my life...""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""tried committing suicide"", ""attempts on my life"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""searching about ways to kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned?
        *   Past: ""phone charger"", ""rope"" (couldn't find).
        *   Current: Not a *chosen* specific method, but ""searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"" is an active step in planning and seeking methods. This indicates a preparation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation?
        *   Past: Yes, the act of using a phone charger.
        *   Current: Yes, ""searching about ways to kill myself"".
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, ""searching for ways"" is a clear preparatory action, so it leans towards 'behavior' for the current state.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both.
        *   Past: ""The first time I tried committing suicide..."", ""multiple attempts on my life"".
        *   Current/Future: ""my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""recently I began searching about ways to kill myself"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""using a phone charger"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post clearly describes past suicide attempts: ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger..."" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life..."". This is a direct fit for the 'Attempt' category definition: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    The post also includes current suicidal ideation (""my death seems to ultimate answer"") and preparatory behavior (""searching about ways to kill myself"").
    The 'Attempt' category definition includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    Since the post describes past attempts (a concrete action with a phone charger) and also mentions current preparatory actions/plans (searching for ways to kill oneself), the 'Attempt' category is the most appropriate according to the provided rules.

I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all, i show nothing but respect and kindness to them but they just fake everything, then when i figure it out im just more dead inside then if they just told me to stop in the first place. Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""more dead inside"" is an emotional descriptor of numbness, not a literal statement about dying or self-harm. No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or specific acts of self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong indicators are present: ""nobody cares about me at all,"" ""more dead inside,"" ""Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything."" These convey significant hopelessness, despair, social isolation, and a feeling of giving up.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""Im done with everything"" in the context of extreme despair (""nobody cares about me,"" ""more dead inside"") is a strong expression of giving up on life. This can be interpreted as a desire to not be alive any longer or an expression of suicidal thoughts, even if not using words like ""die"" or ""suicide."" The Ideation definition includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" and ""vague thoughts about not wanting to live."" ""Done with everything"" fits this, especially given the severe emotional context.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan is mentioned, if it's suicidal, it would be 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""Im done..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses profound hopelessness and despair (""nobody cares about me,"" ""more dead inside""). The statement ""Im done with everything"" is crucial.
    The 'Indicator' category is for ""general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" or ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness... when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    The 'Ideation' category is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... This can range from vague thoughts about not wanting to live to stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life (albeit without a specific plan how to do so).""

    While ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" isn't explicitly stated, ""Im done with everything,"" in the context of such deep emotional pain and hopelessness, strongly implies a desire for life to end or a giving up on life itself. This can be considered an expression of ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" or at least ""thoughts about not wanting to live,"" fitting the 'Ideation' category. The phrase is more than just general dissatisfaction; it's a statement of finality regarding ""everything."" The intensity and comprehensiveness of ""everything"" in this context points towards life itself. The Ideation definition allowing for ""vague thoughts about not wanting to live"" also supports classifying this level of expressed resignation as Ideation. There is no plan mentioned, so it does not reach 'Behavior'.

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"" clearly imply a self-harming or suicidal act.
    *   Note emotional indicators: ""less scary"", ""getting more courage"" suggest a progression towards action and a diminished fear of the act.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Method: ""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"".
        *   Location: ""my bedroom window"".
        *   Preparation/Intent: ""getting more courage"", ""Hopefully I can do it soon"". The mention of ""trees and mud below"" indicates consideration of the specific location and its characteristics, which is part of planning.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" in the context of ""jump out of my bedroom window"" is a direct expression of wanting to perform a life-threatening act, which implies wanting to die or not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"" (method: jumping).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""getting more courage"", ""Hopefully I can do it soon"". The consideration of ""trees and mud below"" also suggests a degree of planning and assessment of the location.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, the method (jumping) and location (bedroom window) are explicit.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""getting more courage"", ""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear intent to perform a life-threatening act (""jump out of my bedroom window"").
    *   It specifies a method (jumping) and a location (bedroom window).
    *   It indicates preparation and a timeline (""getting more courage"", ""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
    *   This goes beyond ""Ideation"" (which is ""without any specific plan"") because a specific method and location are mentioned, along with preparatory thoughts.
    *   It is not ""Indicator"" because the intent for self-harm/suicide is clearly expressed through the planned action, even if the word ""suicide"" isn't used.
    *   It is not ""Attempt"" as it refers to future intentions.
    *   The definition of ""Behavior"" states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from...).""
    *   The post fits this definition: ""jump out of my bedroom window"" is an explicit expression of intent for a suicidal act, and it includes a specific method (jumping) and location (bedroom window), along with preparatory statements.

203,"Should I tell my mom about my issues. I know most peoples first reaction is ""yes, having help only makes it better"" but I feel like I don't really have that relationship with her. There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time.

This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""writing suicide notes"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""depression hits really hard"", ""low energy"", ""hate talking about myself"", ""waste their time"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""writing suicide notes"" is a form of preparation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide notes"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The act of writing suicide notes strongly implies a desire to die or suicidal intent, even if not phrased as ""I want to die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon) is mentioned for carrying out suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" is explicitly listed as an example of preparation in the 'Behavior' category definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" suggests a recurring behavior or current/recent state when depressed, not a resolved past event.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes"".
    *   Writing suicide notes is a form of preparation for suicide.
    *   The definition of **Behavior** states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...).""
    *   Since ""writing suicide notes"" is a preparation and is explicitly mentioned as an example under 'Behavior', this category fits. It's more than 'Ideation' because it describes an action (writing notes) related to suicide, not just thoughts. It is not 'Attempt' as no past action of attempting suicide is described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""People dying is funny"", ""hope that asshole dies"", and critically for the poster, ""hope i die"". The word ""suicide"" is mentioned in the context of ""suicide watchers"" but not as a direct statement of the poster's intent to commit suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses ""suffering mentally"", feeling ""depressed"", anger, and frustration (""fuck me fuck da world""). There's a sense of hopelessness and attention-seeking (""maybe i just need attention yes its all a ruse for attention"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the poster does not explicitly say ""I am going to commit suicide"" or ""I am thinking about suicide"" for themselves. The word ""suicide"" is used in ""suicide watchers"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""hope i die"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The expression ""hope i die"" is a fairly clear expression of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan is mentioned, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""hope i die"" refers to a current wish or feeling.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains the phrase ""hope i die"". This is an explicit expression of a desire to die or not be alive.
    According to the definitions:
    *   **Indicator**: ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide."" ""Hope I die"" is more than a vague feeling; it's a direct wish for death. The definition also states, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" While ""hope I die"" isn't ""killing oneself,"" it's a strong desire for death.
    *   **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""hope i die"" directly fits ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". There is no specific plan mentioned. The Ideation definition also states: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Since a desire to die *is* expressed (""hope i die""), this points away from 'indicator' and towards 'ideation'.
    *   **Behavior**: Requires mention of a plan or method, which is absent.
    *   **Attempt**: Requires description of a past attempt, which is absent.

    The key phrase is ""hope i die"". This is an explicit desire to die. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used by the poster to describe their own intent, the desire to die is clearly stated. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""a desire to not be alive any longer""). There is no plan, so it's not 'Behavior'. It's stronger than just 'Indicator' because ""hope I die"" is not vague.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""cut to deep"" clearly indicates self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""fuck"" indicates distress, pain, or frustration.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cut"" is a method of self-harm. ""to deep"" describes the severity.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""Just cut"" implies a very recent or ongoing action, not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. However, the presence of self-harm behavior needs to be considered for other categories.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut"". This is a method of self-harm.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act itself (""just cut"") is the behavior.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This isn't about *planning* suicide, but about *exhibiting self-harm behavior*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Just cut"" indicates a current or very recent event.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes an act of self-harm (""cut to deep"").
    *   It does not contain explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die.
    *   The definition of **Behavior** includes: ""...or exhibits self-harming behavior.""
    *   ""Cut to deep"" is a clear exhibition of self-harming behavior.
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because it's more specific than general distress; it's an action.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because there's no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die, but there is a described behavior.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because it's described as current (""Just cut"") rather than a historic action, though a severe self-harm act can be a suicide attempt, the classification focuses on how it's presented. The key here is ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" from the 'Behavior' definition.

    The definition of 'Behavior' is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide **or exhibits self-harming behavior**."" The post clearly ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" (""Just cut to deep""). Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions phrases like ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"" which are quoted as things other people say. This implies the context might be related to suicide or severe distress, but the author of *this* post isn't directly stating these for themselves. There's no direct mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm from the author about their own intentions or feelings.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post is laden with strong negative emotions: anger (""random fucking bullshit crap,"" ""OH MY FUCKING GOD,"" ""piece of shit""), frustration (""tired of all the people""), cynicism, and a sense of being misunderstood (""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice lmao""). The author also mentions ""misery of others,"" implying they might be experiencing misery themselves, which others are perceived to ""feed off.""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not by the author about themselves. The phrases ""don't do it!"" are presented as quotes of what *other* people say, likely in response to expressions of distress (possibly suicidal distress) made by the author or others in that online space previously, but not in this specific post by the author.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The author expresses intense frustration and talks about ""what I'm feeling"" and ""misery,"" but doesn't explicitly state a desire to die or end their life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Given the lack of explicit mention of suicide or desire to die from the author, this rule applies.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   This step is not reached if 'ideation' is not established.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current frustrations with ongoing interactions. It doesn't state future intentions regarding suicide.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post is primarily an angry rant against how other people respond to (presumably) expressions of distress. It shows significant emotional distress from the author (""what I'm feeling,"" ""misery,"" intense anger, frustration). However, it lacks any explicit statement from the author about suicidal thoughts, wanting to die, or plans for self-harm. The references to ""don't do it"" are indirect, quoted from others.
    According to the definition of **Indicator**: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    This post fits the 'Indicator' category because it expresses strong distress and dissatisfaction but does not explicitly mention suicide or suicidal ideation from the author's perspective. The mention of ""don't do it"" is a quote attributed to others, not a statement of the author's current suicidal thoughts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains the phrase ""kinda just wanna die,"" which is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive, even if ambivalent.

However, ""wanna die"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
    *   The definition of **Ideation** states ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post: ""kinda just wanna die"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die, and there is no plan mentioned. The rule ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" implies that if such a desire *is* expressed, it leans towards 'ideation'.
    *   **Behavior** is not applicable as there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparations.
    *   **Attempt** is not applicable as there is no mention of a past attempt.

    Given the explicit statement ""kinda just wanna die"", this aligns best with 'Ideation'. The ambivalence (""but dont at the same time"") doesn't negate the expressed desire to die; it just reflects internal conflict, which is common in suicidal ideation. The key is the *expression* of the desire.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""want to justify dying"", ""partially planning to die"", ""self destructive"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse"", ""feel terrible"", ""guilty"", ""fear I only hurt"", ""nihilistic"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""partially planning to die"". However, it also states, ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips,"" which suggests a lack of a concrete or chosen method. No specific preparations (like a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""want to justify dying,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""partially planning to die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. In fact, the post says, ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""partially planning to die"" suggests some cognitive process of planning, but no concrete preparations (notes, acquiring means) are described.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The definition of 'behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". While ""partially planning"" is mentioned, the lack of any specific method or preparation, and the statement about not having methods, means it doesn't meet this criterion for 'behavior'. The plan is not explicit enough.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and ongoing/future intentions (""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now,"" ""they've increased,"" ""partially planning to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and a desire to die (""want to justify dying,"" ""partially planning to die""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.
    *   'Behavior' requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan with ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".
    *   The post mentions ""partially planning to die,"" which suggests a step beyond simple ideation. However, it immediately clarifies, ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips."" This indicates that a specific method, a key component of ""explicit planning"" for the 'behavior' category, has not been identified or secured. No other preparations are mentioned.
    *   Since no specific method or preparations are detailed, and the rule states ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" the post falls into 'ideation'. The ""planning"" mentioned is not explicit enough to meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""better off dead"", ""end it"", ""hang myself"", ""rest in peace"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no fucking reason to keep playing this bullshit game"", ""no reason to keep going""), despair, worthlessness (""ugly useless stupid girl""), anger, frustration.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This describes a method (hanging) and a plan to find a location.
    *   References to past attempts: ""ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it"". This indicates past ideation but not an attempt, as the person states they were ""too scared to end it"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""end it"", ""hang myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""better off dead"", ""no reason to keep going"", ""now i really don't care any more"", ""then i can rest in peace"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post describes a thought process of how to carry out the act: ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This is a plan involving a method and a location strategy. While not stating means have been acquired, it is an explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The plan to ""drive out into the mountains... and hang myself"" refers to current thoughts about future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Past mentions are of being ""too scared to end it,"" which is ideation, not a described attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""hang myself"", ""end it"") and wanting to die (""better off dead"", ""no reason to keep going""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond just expressing a desire to die. It includes a specific method (""hang myself"") and a plan for how and where (""drive out into the mountains and hike... find a nice little spot""). The definition of 'Behavior' is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations..."". The described plan fits this definition.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as the plan is for the future, and past suicidal thoughts did not lead to an attempt according to the post.
    *   The presence of a specific method (hanging) and a described plan (going to the mountains, finding a spot) moves this from 'Ideation' (which is ""without any specific plan"") to 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to be dead."", ""I don't want to live anymore."" These are direct mentions of wanting to die.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I don't enjoy anything."", ""I am lonely."", ""I am not healing. It is terrible."" These indicate hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. The post mentions seeking therapy and taking antidepressants, which are coping mechanisms, not suicide plans.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I want to be dead."" and ""I don't want to live anymore."" are very direct expressions.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. However, the 'ideation' definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."". The phrases ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore"" are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive. This makes it clearer than ""unclear"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan or method is mentioned, this points away from 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The expressions ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore"" refer to current feelings and intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore."" This is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive.
    *   According to the definition of **Indicator**: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" While ""suicide/killing oneself"" is not mentioned by those exact words, ""I want to be dead"" is an explicit expression concerning the desire for death, which is central to suicide.
    *   According to the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This definition fits the post very well because ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore"" are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, and no plan is mentioned. The clarification ""i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" is crucial here.
    *   The post does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not **Behavior**.
    *   The post does not describe any past attempts, so it is not **Attempt**.
    *   The key distinction is between 'indicator' and 'ideation'. The 'indicator' definition states ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" However, the 'ideation' definition provides a clear example: ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". The post contains exactly this. ""I want to be dead"" is an explicit expression of a suicidal feeling/thought, not just general dissatisfaction. The explicitness of ""I want to be dead"" moves it beyond 'indicator' and into 'ideation' as per the provided definitions.

I'm on medication and I see a therapist weekly. When I'm sad, I journal, I use DBT skills, I try to fight cognitive distortions. But I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal. People say to wait it out, but its been years. Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts. Its supposed to get better but I just want to know when.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" multiple times (""so so so unbelievably suicidal"", ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"", ""recovered from being suicidal"").
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I don't know what to do anymore"", ""it's just not working"", ""so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on"", ""I'm just tired of all of it"". Strong indicators of hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The post focuses on the persistence of suicidal thoughts despite efforts to get better.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to personal past attempts. It mentions ""people that have recovered from being suicidal"" but not a personal attempt.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"", ""suicidal thoughts"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"" are direct expressions of having thoughts related to ending one's life, which implies a desire to not be alive, even if not phrased as ""I want to die.""

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is mentioned.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" repeatedly. This clearly indicates more than general distress. It expresses a desire to not be alive through the admission of being ""unbelievably suicidal."" However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'Behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""*sigh*. i wish i wasn't like this :("".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""a woman who killed her husband by putting eye drops in his beverages"" and states, ""i'd be lying if i said that didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method"". This means it *did* give the poster an idea of a specific method (eye drops in beverages).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - Yes, ""eye drops in beverages"" is mentioned as an idea for a suicide method. Eye drops here would be the substance.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No, it's presented as an ""idea"" gained from a video, not as an active preparation.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. However, the definition of 'Ideation' itself states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" The post *does* contain a specific idea of a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current thoughts and newly formed ideas (""just saw a video"", ""didn't give me an idea"" meaning it *did* give an idea).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and a ""suicide method"". This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts... but without any specific plan"".
    *   'Behavior' is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan... like a specific method"".
    *   Critically, the definition of 'Ideation' includes the sentence: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   The post states: ""...i'd be lying if i said that didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method"", referring to ""putting eye drops in his beverages"". This means the poster *did* get an idea of a specific suicide method.
    *   This fits the criterion ""contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)"".

    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide note"", ""free myself of my problems"", ""actually be able to do it this time"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""common denominator in all of my problems"", ""can't even fucking free myself"", ""felt do calm then when I decided how and when"", ""trying to coax the feeling back out"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states: ""A month ago I wrote a suicide note."", ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place."" This refers to past preparations. For current/future, it says ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time,"" which, in context of the past detailed plan, implies a potential to act.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""A month ago I wrote a suicide note. ... Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself."" This describes a past event where significant steps were taken towards suicide before being aborted by the individual.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide note"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""free myself of my problems"", ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not for the current ideation, but a detailed plan was made in the past (""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place.""). The current statement ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" suggests a potential re-engagement with such planning.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Past preparation was explicit (""wrote a suicide note"", ""primed and ready"", ""Picked a time and place""). Current signs are more about mental state and desire (""trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. It describes a past planned attempt that was aborted (""A month ago..."") and expresses current/future suicidal thoughts (""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes. The user describes writing a suicide note, planning everything including time and place, and then ""sabotaged myself."" This describes a past series of actions taken towards suicide that were stopped. This goes beyond ""merely thought of an attempt"" and involves ""concrete action.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post clearly describes a past event where the user took concrete actions towards suicide: ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place,"" and then ""sabotaged myself."" This qualifies as a ""past attempt"" according to the definition (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"").
    The post also contains current suicidal ideation: ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time.""
    The definition for ""Attempt"" states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The current statement, especially in the context of wanting to ""coax the feeling back out"" that came from deciding ""how and when"" in the past, implies current ideation and a potential for planning or acting on previous plans.
    Therefore, the category ""Attempt"" is the most fitting.

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings and ongoing struggles.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post expresses extreme distress, hopelessness, loneliness, and a feeling of worthlessness (""I am just a stain upon the world"", ""the world would not change at all if I were gone"").
    *   However, there is no explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""killing myself,"" or a direct statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to be alive anymore.""
    *   The phrase ""i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" is a strong indicator of distress and perhaps passive suicidal ideation, but it doesn't cross the threshold into an *explicit expression* of wanting to die or commit suicide as required for 'Ideation'.
    *   The rules state: ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" and ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   Given the lack of explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire to die, and the emphasis on general distress and hopelessness, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to die"", ""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I'm done with life all I cause is pain"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Tuesday"", ""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself from a tree"".
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""want to die"", ""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""want to die"", ""I'm done with life"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself from a tree"").

5.  CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""want to die"", ""I'm done with life"") and also mentions specific plans/methods (""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself from a tree"") and a timeframe (""Tuesday""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""better if I was dead"", ""death is just like sleep"", ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please"", ""suicide is selfish"", ""next morning I'm dead?"", ""think that suicide would be better"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The user states ""I don't think I am depressed"", ""I look forward to the next day, I am motivated"", but also ""I often feel that it would be better if I was dead"", ""feel empty"". There's a strong theme of existential questioning and a desire for death as a peaceful state.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The user discusses reasons *against* acting (suicide is selfish, impact on family, friends, dog).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicide is selfish"", ""think that suicide would be better"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""better if I was dead"", ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post is about the thoughts and the reasons *not* to act on them.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current thoughts and feelings (""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts"", ""I often feel that it would be better if I was dead"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and a desire to be dead (""better if I was dead"", ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please""). This fits the definition of 'ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'behavior' because no plan or method is discussed. It is not 'attempt' because no past attempt is described.

Last time I called a hotline just to have someone to talk to (didn't have a method or anything), I ended up having the cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward for 3 days. It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" (""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there"").
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The user expresses being ""worried"" and ""paranoid."" The context implies significant distress leading to the need to call a hotline.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No current plan or method is mentioned. The post explicitly states for a past event, ""didn't have a method or anything.""
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No past suicide attempt is described. Calling a hotline or being hospitalized is not an attempt.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used to describe the user's state.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): The user states a past experience ""made me 10x more suicidal."" While not a direct ""I want to die now"" statement, the current search for a hotline is framed by this experience of heightened suicidality, implying that these feelings are a current concern or are being experienced. This is an explicit reference to suicidal feelings.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past experience (being made ""10x more suicidal"") that is directly influencing the current need for a specific type of hotline. The concern and the need for help are current.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal."" According to the 'Indicator' definition, ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'."" Since ""suicidal"" is an explicit mention, it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post expresses experiencing ""suicidal"" feelings (""made me 10x more suicidal"") and this is the context for the current need for a hotline. This qualifies as an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings.""
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method for suicide.
    *   There is no description of a past attempt.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' category: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The user is expressing that they have experienced suicidal feelings, and this is why they are seeking help now, indicating these feelings are currently relevant.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I dont want to live anymore."" This is a direct expression related to not wanting to be alive.
    *   Emotional indicators: Distress implied by ""This is not right"" and ""I dont want to live anymore."" Desire for isolation (""I just want be by myself"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I dont want to live anymore"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While ""suicide"" isn't mentioned, ""I dont want to live anymore"" is a very explicit expression of a desire to not be alive, which fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings/intentions (""I dont want to live anymore"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains the phrase ""I dont want to live anymore."" This is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive.
    According to the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    This post fits this definition because:
    - It has an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive (""I dont want to live anymore"").
    - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparations.
    It is not 'Indicator' because the desire to not live is explicit, not just general distress or vague feelings about death. The 'Indicator' definition states ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"". Here, a desire to not live (which is a desire to die) is expressed.
    It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan or method.
    It is not 'Attempt' because it refers to current feelings, not a past action.

Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post uses the word ""suicidal"" (in the context of what others say about the poster being ""attention seeking""), ""ended it"" (referring to suicide, again in the context of what others say), and importantly, the poster says, ""They won't believe it until I die.""
    *   Emotional indicators: Strong anger (""FUCK OFF,"" ""I FUCKING HATE IT,"" ""rage""), frustration, desperation (""TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON""), need for help (""I STILL NEED HELP""), feelings of being misunderstood and invalidated (""They don't care. They won't believe it until I die,"" ""BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal"" and ""ended it"" are mentioned, although initially in the context of refuting accusations. The poster also says, ""They won't believe it until I die,"" which is a direct reference to their own potential death.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The statement ""They won't believe it until I die"" is an explicit expression of a suicidal thought or feeling. It signifies a profound level of hopelessness and a contemplation of their own death as a point of validation for their suffering, even if not a direct statement of ""I want to die now."" It expresses a thought that death is a potential outcome or the only way to be truly understood.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan or method is identified, 'Behavior' is not appropriate.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings of distress, anger, and struggle (""IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON,"" ""I STILL NEED HELP""). The phrase ""until I die"" refers to a potential future outcome linked to the current state of being disbelieved and in distress.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not 'Indicator' because it contains explicit mentions of suicide/death related to the poster (""until I die""). The distress is severe and directly linked to thoughts about their own death.
    *   The post fits 'Ideation'. It includes an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" through the statement ""They won't believe it until I die."" This indicates that the poster is contemplating their own death in relation to their current suffering and feelings of being invalidated. While they also express a desire to ""hold on"" and ""need help,"" the presence of this suicidal thought (""until I die"") is key.
    *   The post is not 'Behavior' as there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide.
    *   The post is not 'Attempt' as it does not describe a past suicide attempt.

The statement ""They won't believe it until I die"" is a clear expression of a suicidal thought or feeling, indicating a level of despair where the poster considers their own death as a consequence or a form of validation. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing my self every day"", ""suicide note"", ""final good bye"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""lonely"", ""fucking tired"", ""no more strenght"", ""huts so much"", ""disappointed"", ""sad"". Strong sense of hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"". This indicates significant preparation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer"" - this refers to past expressions of distress or seeking help, not a specific past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""killing my self"", ""suicide note"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes (""feel like killing my self every day"", ""this might be my final good bye"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, rope, specific location) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - Yes, explicitly: ""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"". This constitutes significant preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current/future intentions (""Everythings ready"", ""this might be my final good bye"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""killing my self"") and direct expressions of wanting to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    The post goes beyond just thoughts or desires; it mentions concrete preparations: ""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"".
    The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...).""
    The mention of a ""suicide note"" and ""testament"" being ""ready"" and ""done"" clearly falls under ""preparations taken"". Even though a specific *method* of suicide isn't detailed, the preparations are explicit and significant.
    It is not 'Attempt' as it refers to current/future intentions, not a past action.
    Therefore, the category is 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""kms"" (kill myself) is mentioned multiple times.
        *   ""I'm going to kill myself very soon.""
        *   ""I can't stop cutting."" (explicit self-harm)

    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Explicit intent: ""I'm going to kill myself very soon.""
        *   Method of self-harm: ""cutting"" is explicitly mentioned as an ongoing behavior. Cutting implies a tool (e.g., knife, razor).
        *   No other specific preparations for the suicide act (like a note, or gathering other means for the ""kms soon"" part) are detailed, but the ongoing cutting is a significant behavior.
    *   Check for references to past attempts:
        *   No explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kms"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I'm going to kill myself very soon"", ""I'm about to kms"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cutting"" is mentioned as an ongoing self-harm behavior. This is a method and involves a tool. The post states ""I'm going to kill myself very soon.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The ongoing self-harm (""cutting"") can be seen as a form of behavior related to the suicidal state. The statement ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"" indicates a timeframe and decision.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts **and also** mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide **or exhibits self-harming behavior**. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations...).""
        *   The post has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm going to kill myself very soon"").
        *   It also ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" (""I can't stop cutting"").
        *   The self-harming behavior ""cutting"" implies a ""specific method"" and the use of ""tools/weapons (e.g. knives...)"".
        Therefore, the conditions for 'Behavior' appear to be met.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current self-harm (""I can't stop cutting"") and future suicidal intentions (""I'm going to kill myself very soon"", ""kms soon"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   The post is not 'Attempt' because it does not describe a past attempt.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as having suicidal thoughts ""without any specific plan"".
    *   'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also ... exhibits self-harming behavior."" The post states ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"" (suicidal thought) and ""I can't stop cutting"" (self-harming behavior).
    *   The 'Behavior' definition further states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... tools/weapons (e.g. knives...))."" The act of ""cutting"" is a specific method of self-harm and involves a tool (implied knife or razor), which aligns with this requirement.
    *   The presence of ongoing, explicit self-harm (""cutting"") alongside explicit suicidal intent (""I'm going to kill myself very soon"") elevates this beyond 'Ideation'. The self-harm itself is a critical behavior.

Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"".

    The 'Ideation' definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" The mention of ""shoot myself"" is a specific method. The 'Behavior' definition includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Mentioning ""shoot myself"" qualifies as mentioning a specific method. The past writing of ""suicide notes"" qualifies as preparations taken.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to recent past events (intervention, discovery of notes) and expresses current strong suicidal desires and thoughts about methods (""wanna kill myself"", ""wish I could shoot myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No actual past *attempts* (actions taken to end life) are described. Writing notes is preparation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   The post is not 'Attempt' because no past completed or interrupted attempt (action) is described.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as suicidal thoughts ""without any specific plan"". However, its definition also states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".
    *   The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""wanna kill myself"").
    *   It mentions a specific method (""shoot myself"").
    *   It mentions past preparations (""suicide notes I threw away"").
    *   Even though ""wish I could shoot myself"" isn't a fully formed, immediate plan of action, the mention of a specific method, combined with the past preparation of notes, and the explicit rule in the 'Ideation' definition to classify content with specific methods as 'Behavior', points to 'Behavior'.

    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""OD today"" (overdose), ""popping all of them at once and hope for the best"", ""thinking about suicide for a while now"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""can't feel anything right now"", ""it's all I can think about"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""OD today"", ""popping all of them at once"". Specific medications are listed: ""venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"". The person states ""I have a month's prescription"", indicating access to the means.
    *   References to past attempts: None. ""Been thinking about suicide for a while now"" is ideation, not a past attempt.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Think I'm going to OD today"", ""hope for the best"" after planning to take all pills).

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""thinking about suicide""). It also describes a specific plan (""OD today"", ""popping all of them at once"") and mentions the specific means (""venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"") and access to them (""I have a month's prescription""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a plan with method and means.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""The end is the only thing that feels right now."" This is a strong euphemism for death or the end of life. No explicit use of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up"" (hopelessness, despair). ""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt"" (guilt, farewell). ""thank you to those who brought any light into my life"" (farewell). ""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson. I'm sorry I wasn't a better person"" (farewell, apology, low self-worth).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans or methods are mentioned. The goodbyes can be seen as a form of preparation (like a suicide note), but not detailing a method.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" is a direct expression of wanting life to end or accepting death as the only solution. This goes beyond general sadness.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The desire for ""the end"" is quite clear in this context, especially with the accompanying statements of hopelessness and goodbyes.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The goodbyes and apologies have the tone of a farewell or suicide note, which is a form of preparation. However, the 'Behavior' category requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)."" While it resembles a note, no *method* or acquisition of means is mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific method or concrete preparation for the act itself is mentioned, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/imminent future intentions (""feels right *now*"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses extreme hopelessness and a clear statement that ""the end"" (death) is the only thing that ""feels right."" This is an explicit expression of a desire for life to end.
    *   The goodbyes and apologies are strong indicators of suicidal intent.
    *   While ""suicide"" isn't explicitly named, the 'Ideation' definition includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This post fits that.
    *   The 'Indicator' definition states: ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" However, this post goes beyond general dissatisfaction by stating a preference for ""the end."" The 'Ideation' definition also states: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Here, a desire for ""the end"" (death) is expressed.
    *   There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It is not about a past 'Attempt'.
    *   The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" is a strong expression of a desire to not be alive, fitting 'Ideation'.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:

    *   Emotional indicators: ""feel so bad"", ""terrible terrible"", ""depressed"", ""mind is going crazy"", ""incredibly overwhelmed"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific method.
    *   References to past attempts: ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" indicates past suicidal feelings, but not necessarily a specific attempt.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"", ""cutting my god damn throat"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cutting my god damn throat"". This is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly stated (e.g., having a tool), but the mention of a specific violent method is significant.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""all I want to do is..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, ""I was already suicidal"" refers to a past state, not a specific action/attempt.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal"", ""all I want to do is shut every thought down""). It also mentions a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', which requires explicit suicidal thoughts and mention of a plan or specific method. It is not 'Attempt' as it refers to current feelings and desires, not a past action. It is more than 'Ideation' because a specific method is stated. It is not 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""kill yourself"" as part of a quote the user is asking about.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The poster expresses curiosity (""Anyone know more about it?"") rather than personal distress, hopelessness, or despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the poster.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned by the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""kill yourself"" is part of the quote being discussed.
    *   Are there direct expressions *from the poster* of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The poster is inquiring about a quote, not expressing personal suicidal feelings or desires. The mention of suicide is in the context of an external quote, not a personal statement of intent or feeling from the poster.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Given the context is an inquiry about a quote, and not a personal expression of suicidal thoughts, this leans towards 'indicator' as per the rule that ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Not applicable as there's no indication of personal ideation from the poster.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions *of the poster*? No, it refers to a quote the poster ""recently stumbled upon"". It does not express the poster's current or future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described *by the poster*? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post discusses a quote that mentions suicide (""kill yourself""). However, the crucial rule is ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"" (or, in this case, content being quoted). The poster is asking for information about a quote; they are not expressing personal suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts.
    -   **Indicator** definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide [from the poster, about themselves]. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings [from the poster]."" While the quote mentions suicide, the poster's *own expression* does not indicate personal suicidal thoughts. They are discussing an external piece of content. The mention of suicide is not a self-expression of the poster's feelings or intent.
    -   **Ideation** definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."" The poster is not expressing such thoughts or feelings for themselves.

    Since the poster is merely asking about a quote and not expressing any personal suicidal ideation, the post falls into the 'Indicator' category. The mention of suicide is referential (to a quote) rather than an expression of the poster's own state.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog"" (implying wanting to die to be with a deceased pet).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""not happy anymore"", ""never been truly happy"", ""give up on everything"", ""endless loop"", ""life will never get better"", ""can't do this anymore"". These indicate significant hopelessness and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"")? No, these specific words are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""i want to leave earth"", ""i always end up wanting to die"", and ""now i'm ready to join my dog"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive.
    *   The 'Indicator' definition states: ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" However, the 'Ideation' definition clarifies: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". The expressions here (""wanting to die"", ""want to leave earth"") are explicit desires to not be alive, fitting the 'Ideation' criteria. The 'Indicator' definition also states it applies if ""no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed"". Here, a desire to die *is* expressed.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post does not mention any specific method, tools, locations, or preparations. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator**: This category is for posts lacking explicit expressions concerning suicide or a desire to die. This post contains explicit expressions like ""wanting to die"" and ""want to leave earth"". The 'Indicator' definition also states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"". Since a desire to die is expressed, this category is not suitable.
    *   **Ideation**: This category is for content with explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, or a desire to not be alive, but *without* a specific plan. The post explicitly states ""wanting to die"" and ""want to leave earth"", which are clear expressions of a desire to not be alive. No specific plan is mentioned. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   **Behavior**: This category requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mention of a plan or method. No plan or method is mentioned in the post.
    *   **Attempt**: This category is for descriptions of past suicide attempts. The post does not describe any past attempts.

    Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""wanting to die"", ""want to leave earth"") but does not include any specific plan or method. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? (No) - No preparations are mentioned.
    *   The past plan is now cancelled. There is no current plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past intention/decision (""I was going to kill myself"") that has now been changed (""Now, I know I can't do that""). However, it also states ""Nothing has changed for me"" and ""his passing has saved my life *for the time being*"", suggesting the underlying issues or potential for future ideation might persist.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. It describes a past *decision* or *plan*, not a past *action* or *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not **Indicator**: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").
    *   Not **Attempt**: The post describes a past *decision* or *intention* (""I was going to kill myself""), not a past *action* or *attempt*. The definition of 'Attempt' specifies ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"".
    *   Not **Behavior**: There is no *current* plan with specific methods or preparations. The past plan mentioned (""kill myself before Christmas"") lacked a specific method in the post and is now explicitly cancelled.
    *   **Ideation**: The post includes an explicit expression of past suicidal thoughts and a decision to act on them (""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit""). Although this specific plan is now stated as cancelled, the expression of these serious suicidal thoughts is present. The phrases ""Nothing has changed for me"" and ""saved my life *for the time being*"" suggest that while the immediate plan is off, the underlying suicidal feelings or thoughts might still be present or could return. The definition of 'Ideation' is ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post clearly expresses past suicidal thoughts/desire. While the *plan* is off, the expression of the ideation itself fits. The lack of a *current active plan* but the clear statement of past (and potentially lingering) suicidal thoughts points to Ideation.

When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"" is an active preparation, a step taken towards finding a method.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Researching methods is a preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

It refers to recent past (""whole month of February""), ongoing triggers (""When we fight I always think about suicide""), and current/recurring actions (""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself""). The desire to commit suicide is presented as a current, triggered response and action.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and wanting to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   There are no described past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan"".

    *   The phrase ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"" signifies an active step beyond just thinking about suicide. It is a form of preparation and planning, even if a specific method isn't stated as chosen. This aligns with the ""preparations taken"" part of the 'Behavior' definition. The act of researching is a behavior directed towards finding a means to end life.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Life is useless"" and fantasizing about ""something better on the other side"" in the context of normalizing suicide strongly suggests a desire to not be alive or an acceptance/consideration of suicide as an option.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicide."" It expresses a strong sense of hopelessness (""Life is useless"") and a contemplation of death as a preferable state (""something better on the other side""). The statement ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"" clearly indicates that suicide is on the person's mind. These are expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It's not 'Behavior' because no plan is present. It's not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. Phrases like ""To never feel pain anymore,"" ""To be nothing in a black sea of infinity,"" and ""To let go after holding on so tight,"" coupled with calling the ""thought of death just beautiful,"" are direct expressions of finding death desirable and wanting to cease existence or escape current suffering, which equates to a desire to not be alive.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.** The definition of 'ideation' is ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."". The post does express a desire to not be alive any longer by framing death as a beautiful escape from pain. The 'indicator' definition states ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" However, it also states for 'indicator' that it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post *does* contain an indication of suicidal thoughts/feelings through the expressed desire for death as an escape from pain. The 'ideation' definition's clause ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" is key; here, a desire to die *is* expressed. The post goes beyond ""general expressions of distress"" or ""vague feeling about dying"" and explicitly articulates death as a positive state to end suffering. Thus, it aligns with 'ideation'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** Since no plan is mentioned, it is not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes a current thought process or feeling (""Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?""). It reflects a current state of mind.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No. Therefore, it is not 'attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses a clear desire for death as a means to end pain and suffering (""To never feel pain anymore,"" ""To be nothing""). This is an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which fits the definition of 'Ideation'. While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the romanticization of death as a beautiful escape from life's burdens is a strong indicator of suicidal ideation. There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it's not 'Behavior'. There's no mention of past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'. It's more than 'Indicator' because it's not just general distress or a vague feeling about death; it's a direct contemplation and positive appraisal of death as a desirable state to escape suffering. The desire to not be alive is explicitly expressed.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."", ""committing suicide"", ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day.""
    *   Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, isolation, feeling like an outcast, being tired of life, feeling uncared for, ""will to live like this is hanging by a thread.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: There's a conditional plan: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" The method mentioned is ""i'll use any method i can"". This is a general statement about method, not a specific one. No specific preparations are mentioned (like acquiring means or writing a note).
    *   References to past attempts: ""the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide"" implies prior consideration but does not describe a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""committing suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""as long as i don't see another day"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""any method i can"" is a general statement of intent to find a method, not a specific method itself (e.g., pills, weapon, location).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   The plan is conditional (""if i'm positive""). While there's a clear intent to act under a certain condition, the definition of 'behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". ""Any method"" is not a specific method. The rule ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions, contingent on COVID test results (""i'll be deciding what to do once i get them"", ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   It refers to future intentions, not past actions, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
        *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""
    *   The post contains a conditional plan (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself""). However, the method mentioned (""i'll use any method i can"") is not a *specific* method as exemplified in the 'Behavior' definition (e.g., ""lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...""). The lack of a specific method or mention of preparations, coupled with the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", leads to classifying this as 'Ideation'. The desire to die is strong and explicit, but the plan lacks the specificity of method required for 'Behavior'.

    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""kill mslef""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Failrure"", ""burden"", ""disappoinment"", ""Pleasw help, i have nobody else"" (implies hopelessness, despair)
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (this is a described past action/method)
    *   References to past attempts: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" clearly describes a past attempt.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""kill mslef"")
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""What shoul i do kill mslef"")

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

    *   Are there signs of preparation? The preparation (""entire bottle o zopiclone"") relates to the past event. No new preparation for a current plan is detailed.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"") and also expresses current suicidal ideation (""What shoul i do kill mslef"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" is a description of a concrete past action (overdose).

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"". This fits the definition of ""Attempt"": ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    The definition also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The post clearly describes a past attempt and also contains current suicidal ideation (""What shoul i do kill mslef""). Therefore, 'Attempt' is the correct classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts."" This implies the ""awful thoughts"" are related to self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""frustrating to hold my tears,"" ""eyes are burning so bad,"" ""can't sleep anymore,"" ""can't bring myself to do what I enjoy,"" ""felt guilty,"" ""I'm so tired,"" ""drowning in these awful thoughts,"" ""I'm so scared."" These indicate significant distress and hopelessness.

    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Not a direct statement like ""I want to die."" However, ""drowning in these awful thoughts"" in the context of ""don't have a plan to hurt myself"" strongly suggests the thoughts are about self-harm, which falls under suicidal ideation. The phrase ""hurt myself"" is a clear reference to self-harm/suicidal thoughts.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While ""suicide"" isn't explicitly stated, the mention of thoughts about ""hurting myself"" is a fairly explicit expression of suicidal/self-harm thoughts. The 'Ideation' definition includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" Thoughts about ""hurting myself"" qualify.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   The post explicitly states: ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': This reinforces that it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current (""I've been drowning,"" ""I'm so scared"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness. Crucially, it states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts."" This indicates the presence of thoughts about self-harm (""hurting myself""), even though a plan is denied.
    - It's not 'Indicator' because there's more than just general distress; there's an indication of thoughts about self-harm (""awful thoughts"" about ""hurting myself""). The 'Indicator' definition states ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" Here, ""thoughts"" about ""hurting myself"" is an indication.
    - It fits 'Ideation' because it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (thoughts about ""hurting myself"") ""but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there is an explicit denial of a plan (""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"").
    - It's not 'Attempt' because there's no mention of past attempts.
    The phrase ""awful thoughts"" combined with the context of ""hurt myself"" points to suicidal ideation.

I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing.

As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all.

        *   Worry, anxiety.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The thoughts of self-harm are presented as fantasies he hasn't acted on. Passive wishes like ""roof collapses"" are not active plans.
    *   References to past attempts:
        *   ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression"" - not specified as a suicide attempt.
        *   ""I've never purposely hurt myself"" - explicitly denies past self-harm or attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used. However, the intent is clear.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
        *   ""I fucking hate being alive.""
        *   ""I want to die""
        *   ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The expressions ""I want to die"" and ""I fucking hate being alive"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'Ideation' (""a desire to not be alive any longer""). This is beyond ""vague feeling about dying"" (Indicator).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. Thoughts like ""amputating parts of my body and burning myself"" are mentioned as imaginings, not plans, and he states he's never hurt himself. Passive wishes (""roof collapses"") are not plans.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings and intentions (""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every fucking day"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Hospitalization for depression is mentioned, but not as a suicide attempt. He explicitly states, ""I've never purposely hurt myself.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains multiple explicit expressions of wanting to die and hating being alive (""I want to die"", ""I fucking hate being alive"", ""I think about dying every fucking day""). This clearly goes beyond 'Indicator' which ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" or only has ""vague feeling about dying"".
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. The thoughts of self-harm are explicitly stated as imaginings that have not been acted upon. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt. The hospitalization was for depression, and he states he has never purposely hurt himself. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""hurting so bad emotionally"", ""so depressed"", ""muscles ache"", ""everything is so exhausting"", ""my own body is giving up"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No active plan or method mentioned. ""Die in my sleep"" is a passive wish.
    *   References to past attempts: No.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" is a direct expression of wanting to die/not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While ""suicide"" itself isn't mentioned, the phrase ""hoping i will die"" is a very direct expression of wanting to not be alive. The definition of Ideation includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""Dying in my sleep"" is a passive wish, not a method of self-harm or suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/immediate future (""tonight"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness.
    *   It contains an explicit desire to die (""hoping i will die in my sleep tonight""). According to the definition of 'Ideation', this qualifies as an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   There is no specific plan or method mentioned for actively ending life, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   It is more than 'Indicator' because of the explicit wish to die, even if ""suicide"" is not the word used. The desire to not be alive is clear.

The post expresses a desire to die (""hoping i will die in my sleep tonight""). This falls under ""Ideation"" as it's an explicit desire to not be alive, but lacks a specific plan or method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Zoloft overdose"", ""kill me"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied distress leading to the overdose, but current state is ""completely fine now apart from slight nausea and I'm really sweaty"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Zoloft overdose"", ""took 6 pills"", ""300mg"". This describes an action taken.
    *   References to past attempts: The entire post describes an action that has already occurred (""at 11:30 I took 6 pills"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" isn't used, but ""kill me"" in the context of an overdose is a very strong implication of suicidal intent for the action described.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""It obviously wasn't enough to kill me"" refers to the intent behind the past action of taking the pills.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Zoloft overdose"", ""6 pills"", ""300mg"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills is the execution of a plan that already happened.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""at 11:30 I took 6 pills""). The question ""will I be okay"" is about the consequences of that past event.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the overdose is described as an action that was taken with the (failed) intent to die.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post clearly describes a past action: ""at 11:30 I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"". The stated outcome was that ""It obviously wasn't enough to kill me"". This fits the definition of ""Attempt"": ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans.

At peace knowing it's soon. Hope my plan works though, there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states ""destined to do it,"" ""I've made my decision,"" ""it's soon,"" and ""Hope my plan works though."" ""Do it"" in this context strongly implies suicide, especially combined with ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post mentions ""chronic stress,"" ""hellish trauma,"" ""severe chronic fatigue syndrome,"" and ""disability."" It also expresses a sense of hopelessness about the physical condition (""body that has clearly given up""). Paradoxically, it also mentions feeling ""calm"" and ""at peace"" about the decision, which can be a sign of resolved suicidal intent.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""my plan"" (""Hope my plan works though"") but does not specify any method, tools, location, or other preparations.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: There are no references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used. However, phrases like ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" and ""it's soon"" in the context of ""no way I'm living"" are strong euphemisms for suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up"" is a direct expression of not wanting to live under current conditions.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the intent is quite clear from the combination of phrases. It's beyond general distress. The expressions point to a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No, no specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): The post mentions ""my plan,"" which implies a plan exists, but no specific preparations (like writing a note or acquiring means) are detailed in the post.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': This rule is key here. A plan is mentioned (""my plan""), but no *explicit details* of the plan (method, means) are provided.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current/future intentions (""it's soon,"" ""Hope my plan works"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This post goes beyond 'Indicator' because it expresses a clear desire not to live (""no way I'm living"") and mentions a decision and a plan related to ending life, even if euphemistically.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits. There are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" ""no way I'm living""). The post mentions a ""plan,"" but does not specify it. The definition of Ideation is ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" While a plan is *mentioned*, its specifics are absent.
    *   **Behavior:** The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide OR exhibits self-harming behavior. It MUST include some form of explicit planning like a specific method OR preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)."" The post mentions ""my plan,"" which satisfies the ""mentions a plan"" part. However, it does *not* include ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The examples given for explicit planning are not present. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies. Since the plan's details (method/means) are missing, it does not meet the ""must include"" criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Attempt:** This is not an 'Attempt' as it refers to current/future intentions, not a past action.

The post clearly indicates suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. It mentions a ""plan"" but provides no details about the method, means, or specific preparations. According to the 'Behavior' definition, it ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" Since this is absent, and given the rule to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' if unsure about explicit planning, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category. The mention of a plan without any specifics keeps it within 'Ideation' rather than escalating it to 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide forum"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Hopeless"", ""realizing you're hopeless is too much"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation for committing suicide is mentioned. Wanting to find a ""suicide forum"" is information-seeking, not a plan for the act itself.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide forum"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not in a direct ""I want to die"" statement, but the combination of ""hopeless is too much"" and the active desire ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum"" strongly implies suicidal thoughts and an engagement with the concept of suicide. This constitutes an explicit expression concerning suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, seeking a forum is not a preparation in the sense of acquiring means or writing a note.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No explicit plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I just want to find..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for posts lacking ""any explicit expression concerning suicide."" The post explicitly mentions ""suicide forum,"" so it's not 'Indicator'. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" doesn't apply because ""suicide"" (via ""suicide forum"") *is* explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** This category is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan."" The statement ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum,"" in the context of extreme hopelessness (""hopeless is too much""), is an explicit expression of being preoccupied with or exploring suicide, which falls under ""suicidal thoughts or feelings."" There is no specific plan mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires mention of a ""plan to commit suicide"" or ""specific method or preparations."" Seeking a forum is not a plan or method for the act itself.
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempt is described.

    The post clearly goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of ""suicide forum."" It doesn't meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there's no plan or method. The desire to find a ""suicide forum"" coupled with expressed hopelessness is a strong indication of suicidal ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""slash my wrists and die"", ""just want an end"").

    The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method...""
    ""Slash my wrists"" is a specific method. The user states they are ""on the verge of trying"" this method. This fits 'Behavior'.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""life is not able to be fixed"", ""pain will all be gone"", feelings of being misunderstood (""no-one I know has gone through the things I have gone through""), cynicism (""That is the most bullshit phase I have ever heard""). These indicate hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it"" is a specific preparation. No specific method of suicide is mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I cannot wait to die"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. This is clear enough to be more than 'indicator' due to the direct expression of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (tools, locations, substances) for ending life is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it"". This is a sign of preparation, similar to settling affairs or writing a note.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The preparation of arranging funeral costs is a concrete step.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I cannot wait to die"", ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

    *   ""Fixing funeral costs"" qualifies as a ""preparation taken"". It's a concrete action planned in anticipation of death, similar to writing a suicide note (which is an example under 'Behavior').
    *   Therefore, the post shows both suicidal ideation (""cannot wait to die"") and a preparatory action (""fix all of the funeral costs""), fitting the 'Behavior' category.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""what's really the point?"" could be interpreted as a vague feeling about life's meaning, but not explicitly death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""depressed life,"" ""can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past,"" ""perfect happiness has now left me."" These indicate hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. ""what's really the point?"" is an expression of hopelessness and questioning the meaning of life, but not a direct statement of wanting to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and there's no direct expression of wanting to die, this leans towards 'indicator'.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post expresses significant dissatisfaction with life (""what's really the point?"") and hopelessness (""destined to live a depressed life""). However, it does not explicitly mention suicide, wanting to die, or any plans. According to the definition, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""jump from a bridge"", ""highest chance of death"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied desperation, seeking information for a lethal outcome.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Method (""jump from a bridge""), timeframe (""by the weekend""), action (""gonna pick one"").
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""jump from a bridge"" with the intent of ""highest chance of death"" is an explicit reference to a suicidal act.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, the phrase ""highest chance of death"" clearly indicates a desire to die.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): Yes, ""jump from a bridge"" is a specific method and implies a type of location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): Yes, ""I'm gonna pick one [bridge] by the weekend"" indicates active planning and preparation (selecting a location).

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current/future intentions (""gonna pick one by the weekend"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post expresses a clear desire to die (""highest chance of death"") and outlines a specific method (""jump from a bridge""). Furthermore, it indicates active planning and a timeframe (""gonna pick one by the weekend""). This goes beyond mere ideation as it includes a method and preparatory steps.

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and a perceived ongoing, unchangeable future state of suffering (""I will never die,"" ""pain will never loosen it's grip,"" ""this is my destiny"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped in pain (""I supposed to suffer. This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain. I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip.""). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or killing oneself. The statement ""I will never die"" is contrary to expressing a desire for death. According to the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" The post fits this description due to the high level of distress and hopelessness without explicit suicidal content.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""ended her life"" (referring to sister's suicide).
        *   ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" (referring to the post author).
        *   ""losing two children to suicide"" (hypothetical future event for parents).
        *   ""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" (author's current feeling).
        *   ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from"" (author's current feeling).
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):
        *   ""can't shake the pain""
        *   ""so much doubt about myself""
        *   ""doesn't feel that far-fetched [ending own life]""
        *   ""welcome end to everything""
        *   ""don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore""
        *   ""neither particularly excited about to put off by [rest of my life]""
        *   ""why bother going through all of it?""
        *   ""However little I think I'm worth as an individual""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific current plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned by the author for themself.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: Yes, ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide,"" ""ended her life"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned (for a current attempt)? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation (for a current attempt)? No.
    *   The past ""aborted attempt"" implies a method was involved historically, but no details are given, and it's not a current plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both.
        *   Past events: Sister's suicide, author's ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""
        *   Current/future intentions: The author expresses current strong suicidal thoughts (""welcome end,"" ""idea of that state lasting forever"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" This implies a concrete action was initiated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states, ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""
    The definition of **Attempt** is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" An ""aborted attempt"" signifies that a concrete action was initiated in the past.
    The post also contains strong current suicidal ideation (""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from""), which would fit 'Ideation'.
    However, the definition of 'Attempt' also notes: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While this post has current *ideation* rather than explicit current *plans* (which would be 'Behavior'), the primary definition of 'Attempt' (""The content describes past attempts at suicide"") is clearly met by the mention of the ""aborted attempt at suicide."" The presence of a described past attempt is the defining characteristic for this category. The current ideation is significant but does not change the classification from 'Attempt' when a past attempt is described.

There's no emotion anymore. No sadness, its just nothing. The pain in numb now, but that's nothing new. I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess. I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I plan on doing it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide in this context. ""less of a mess"" refers to the aftermath of the act.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""can't continue this disappointment,"" ""bring me back to nothing,"" ""no hope anymore,"" ""no joy anymore,"" ""no emotion anymore,"" ""pain is numb,"" ""sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best."" These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and a sense of resignation.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess."" This mentions a specific location (""in the tub"") and a consideration related to the method/outcome (""less of a mess""). The apology and justification (""I'm sorry... it's for the best"") can be seen as a form of a suicide note or farewell.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""I plan on doing it"" in the context of profound despair and farewells is a very strong and clear implication of suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't continue this disappointment"" and ""I plan on doing it"" clearly express an intent to end life.
    *   Given the strength of ""I plan on doing it"" and the surrounding context, it's beyond just an 'indicator'. It points to ideation at a minimum, but the planning aspect needs to be considered next.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? While a specific tool or substance isn't named, ""in the tub"" is a specific location for the act. ""there will be less of a mess"" implies a method has been considered with this outcome in mind (e.g., exsanguination, which is common in a tub to contain blood).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" indicates a plan. The farewell message ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You."" also suggests preparation and finality.
    *   The mention of a specific location (""in the tub"") and a practical consideration for the aftermath (""less of a mess"") constitutes a plan, even if the exact method isn't detailed. This moves it beyond 'ideation'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I plan on doing it"" clearly refers to current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal intent (""I plan on doing it"").
    *   It also includes elements of a plan: a specific location (""in the tub"") and consideration for the method's consequences (""less of a mess"").
    *   The farewell message further supports the seriousness and planning.
    *   This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations...""
    *   The post goes beyond 'Ideation' because a location and consideration for the method are present, indicating a plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want the pain to go away"" - this is an expression of distress, but not an explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""pain"" indicates emotional distress. The request ""Can someone just hug me please"" suggests a need for comfort, loneliness, or sadness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. ""Want the pain to go away"" is a desire for relief from suffering, not an explicit statement of wanting to die or not be alive. It's ambiguous.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Given the ambiguity and lack of explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die, this leans towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   This step is not relevant if 'ideation' is not reached.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings (""I just want the pain to go away"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    The post expresses emotional distress (""pain"") and a desire for comfort (""hug me""). It does not explicitly mention suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The phrase ""want the pain to go away"" is a general expression of suffering. According to the definition of ""Indicator"": ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.

    The post contains general expressions of distress but no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post starts with ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and later mentions ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" It also details past self-harming behavior: ""I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self...""
    *   Note emotional indicators: The post is replete with indicators of extreme distress, hopelessness, despair, trauma, loneliness, failure, physical and mental pain (epilepsy, headaches, paranoia, body dysmorphia, anorexia, melancholic mind, brain fog, neglect, ostracization, trauma from car crash, eye injury, bullying, mental breakdowns, abandonment, depression, addiction).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states an intention (""IM GOING TO END IT"") but does not specify a current plan, method, or preparations for how this will be carried out. The mention of past paracetamol use is described as a coping mechanism that led to addiction and health damage, not as a current plan to end life.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The chronic use of paracetamol leading to addiction and severe liver/digestive damage is a significant self-harming behavior. Whether this constitutes a ""suicide attempt"" by the definition (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)"") is debatable as it's described as an addiction ""to cope,"" rather than a single, distinct act with the explicit intent to die at that moment. It's severe self-harm with life-threatening consequences.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""END IT"" is a clear euphemism for suicide in this context.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""wanting to end it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned for the current intention to ""end it."" The past paracetamol use is described in the context of coping and addiction, not as the intended method for the current suicidal declaration.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of current preparation are mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This rule applies as no explicit current plan is stated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post begins with a clear statement of current/future intention (""IM GOING TO END IT"") and then provides extensive background of past suffering and past self-harming behaviors (paracetamol addiction).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The paracetamol addiction leading to severe health damage is described. It was a pattern of behavior ""to cope,"" not explicitly framed as a singular ""attempt"" to die, though it was highly self-destructive.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states a current intention to commit suicide (""IM GOING TO END IT,"" ""wanting to end it""). This clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    However, the post does not describe a specific plan or method for how the person intends to carry out this act *now*. It lists the *reasons why*. The past paracetamol use, while severe self-harm, is presented as a coping mechanism that led to addiction and health damage, not as the current method for suicide.
    According to the definitions:
    -   'Ideation': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide... stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life (albeit without a specific plan how to do so)."" This fits well.
    -   'Behavior': ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" There is no *current* explicit plan or method mentioned for the stated intention to ""end it.""
    -   'Attempt': ""describes past attempts at suicide."" The paracetamol addiction is severe self-harm. If it's considered a past attempt, the rule ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" doesn't fully apply as there are no current *plans*, but strong current *ideation*. The primary focus of the post's opening is current intent. The definition of attempt specifies ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" Addiction is a chronic condition. While it involves actions, it's not framed as a single past overdose event with intent to die.

    Given the explicit statement of intent to die (""IM GOING TO END IT"") without a specified current plan or method, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" further supports this.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""I really want to fucking kill myself"", ""lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head"", ""I feel like cutting myself again"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Extreme distress (""Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.""), hopelessness (""I have no one""), sadness (loss of boyfriend, parental trust).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head"". This is a specific method (train impact) and location (train station, train tracks).
    *   References to past attempts: ""cutting myself again"" implies past self-harm. It is not explicitly stated if this past cutting was a suicide attempt. The phrase ""I feel like cutting myself again"" also indicates current ideation of self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I really want to fucking kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head""). This includes a method (train impact) and a specific type of location (train tracks at a nearby station).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post describes thinking about the plan (""I'm thinking about running away...""). While not an action taken yet, it's a formulated plan. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""I really want to fucking kill myself"", ""I'm thinking about running away..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? ""cutting myself again"" refers to past self-harm. It's not explicitly stated as a ""suicide attempt."" The current urge is ""I feel like cutting myself again.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I really want to fucking kill myself"").
    *   It details a specific plan: method (train crushing head) and location (train station near house, on the tracks). This fulfills the criteria for ""explicit planning like a specific method or... suitable locations (e.g. ... train lines to get run over by)"" in the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   The phrase ""I feel like cutting myself again"" indicates current ideation of self-harming behavior, which also aligns with the 'Behavior' definition (""...or exhibits self-harming behavior"").
    *   While ""cutting myself again"" implies past self-harm, it's not explicitly described as a past *suicide attempt*. The 'Attempt' category requires the content to ""describe past attempts at suicide."" Without this explicit description, and with a strong current plan, 'Behavior' is more fitting. The rule for 'Attempt' also says ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" The past cutting is stated as a behavior, not necessarily an attempt with lethal intent described.
    *   The post clearly goes beyond 'Ideation' because a specific method and location are mentioned for the suicidal plan.

Therefore, the category 'Behavior' is the most appropriate.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Trying to kill myself"", ""end my own life"", ""I'm going to try again"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""Nothing in my life feels real"", ""guilty"", ""pain"", ""anger"", ""shame"", ""fucking loser"", feelings of abandonment and being uncared for. Strong hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" This indicates a plan with a considered method, even if not explicitly named, and a concern about its execution (""my math is off"").
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real"" (suggests repeated actions), ""I feel shame for failing"" (explicitly indicates a past failed attempt).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""Trying to kill myself"", ""end my own life"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""different method"" is mentioned, described as ""much easier and not so easy to back out of"". The phrase ""my math is off"" suggests a method involving calculation (e.g., dosage of substances). This constitutes a plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The selection of a ""different method"" with specific characteristics (""easier"", ""not so easy to back out of"") and consideration of potential failure points (""my math is off"") are signs of planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. ""Failing"" refers to a past event (attempt). ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method"" refers to current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""failing"" describes the outcome of a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die.
    It refers to past attempts (""I feel shame for failing"").
    It also details a current plan (""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method... my math is off"").
    The definition of 'Behavior' would fit due to the presence of a plan: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method...""
    However, the definition for 'Attempt' includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    This post clearly refers to past attempts (""failing"").
    This post also clearly mentions current plans (""going to try again... different method... math is off"").
    Therefore, according to this specific rule, the post should be classified as 'Attempt'.

All I want is courage to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""It's over. All I want is courage to end it."" This is a clear reference to ending one's life, i.e., suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No bueno,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""No money will rot your brain,"" ""It's over."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The post expresses a desire but not how.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No):** Yes, ""end it"" in the context of ""All I want is courage to end it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No):** Yes, ""All I want is courage to end it"" directly expresses a desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances):** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means):** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** This applies as no plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current/future intentions (""All I want is courage to end it"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to ""end it"" (suicide) and a desire for the courage to do so. This clearly goes beyond general distress. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because ""end it"" is an explicit reference to suicide in this context.
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because there's no plan or method mentioned.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because it refers to current desires, not a past action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""going out of this world"", ""offing myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I'm not worth living"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific date and time are mentioned: ""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours."" The post also states ""I'm going out"" and ""I'm offing myself then,"" indicating a planned action at that specific time. ""Goodbye world"" acts as a form of suicide note.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""offing myself"" is a direct expression. ""Going out of this world"" in this context also clearly implies suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm not worth living"" and ""I'm offing myself then.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *method* (e.g., pills, weapon) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. A very specific date and time (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours"") is stated for the act. The post itself, with ""Goodbye world,"" serves as a preparation akin to a suicide note. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". Setting a precise time for the act is a clear sign of planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to future intentions (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours. I'm going out."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""offing myself"") and a desire to die (""I'm not worth living""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post refers to a future plan, not a past event, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' (suicidal thoughts without a specific plan) and 'Behavior' (suicidal thoughts *with* a plan or preparations).
    *   The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""offing myself"").
    *   It also mentions a specific plan: a precise date and time (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours"") for when the person intends to ""go out of this world"" and ""off myself."" This specificity in timing constitutes a plan.
    *   The phrase ""Goodbye world"" also acts as a preparation (a form of suicide note), which is listed as an example under 'Behavior'.
    *   Even though a specific *method* isn't detailed, the explicit statement of intent to act at a specific future time, combined with the ""goodbye"" message, points to 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Behavior' states ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". The specific timing and the note-like farewell qualify as explicit planning and preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" strongly implies a desire for one's own non-existence. ""I have to make it stop"" in the context of ""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause"" and ""I just can't do this anymore"" suggests stopping one's life.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""can't do this anymore"" (hopelessness, overwhelm), ""upset and pain and hurt I cause"" (guilt, despair, feeling like a burden).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" is a direct expression of feeling that one's non-existence would be preferable, which is a strong indicator of a desire to not be alive. ""I have to make it stop"" (referring to their life/suffering they perceive they cause) also points in this direction.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan is mentioned, it is not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and a future intention (""I have to make it stop"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear desire for non-existence (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"") and an intention to end the current state of suffering (""I have to make it stop""). This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrase ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" is a well-understood expression of suicidal ideation, indicating a desire to not be alive.
    *   It is more than 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post directly indicates suicidal thoughts/feelings.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' as no plan or method is mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this."" - implies wanting to end things.
        *   ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it..."" - ""it"" clearly refers to suicide in this context. This is a strong indicator of suicidal thought.
        *   ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it."" - ""it"" again refers to suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:**
        *   ""I lost everyone in my life.""

        *   ""nothing is better than this. It has to be better."" (implying death is preferable)
        *   Strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, being a burden, and isolation are present.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   No specific plan, method (tools, location, substances), or preparation is mentioned. The post mentions fear of ""botching it,"" but not *how* they would attempt it.
    *   **References to past attempts:**
        *   ""I would have done it already"" refers to a past inclination or strong thought, not a concrete action taken. It does not describe a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No):** No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No):** Yes.
        *   ""I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this.""
        *   ""I would have done it already..."" (implies wanting to have died/ended life)
        *   ""nothing is better than this. It has to be better."" (implies death is better)
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, phrases like ""I would have done it already"" are very direct expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive. The 'ideation' definition includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". This condition seems met. The post goes beyond ""general dissatisfaction"" or ""vague feeling about dying.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** This applies, as there is no explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post expresses current distress (""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge"") and contemplates the future (""Everyone would feel sad if I did it""). It also refers to a past conditional desire (""I would have done it already"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No. ""I would have done it already"" is not a description of a past action/attempt but a past unfulfilled desire or thought.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for posts lacking explicit expression concerning suicide or direct indication of suicidal thoughts. The post contains ""I would have done it already"" and ""I can't anymore,"" which are direct indications of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive. Therefore, it's more than 'indicator'. The definition of 'indicator' states ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"". A desire to die *is* expressed here.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits. The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (e.g., ""I would have done it already,"" ""I can't anymore""). There is no specific plan or method mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires mention of a plan or method, which is absent.
    *   **Attempt:** This category requires description of a past attempt (a concrete action). ""I would have done it already"" is a thought, not a past action.

    The phrases ""I would have done it already"" and ""I can't anymore"" are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, fulfilling the criteria for 'Ideation'. Even though the word ""suicide"" is not used, the intent and thought are clear. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" is considered, but the presence of ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" strongly points to 'ideation'. The post is not merely expressing general dissatisfaction or vague feelings about death; it's expressing clear suicidal thoughts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" (mentioned twice).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""completely failing school"", ""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore"", ""life just isn't worth it"", ""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family"". These indicate hopelessness, anhedonia, despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post asks ""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends"". This is a consideration related to the act, but not a specific method, tool, location, or preparation for the suicide itself. No means are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I need to kill myself"", ""life just isn't worth it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The question about minimizing hurt is not a method for suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific method or preparation for the act of suicide is mentioned, it does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I need to kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post does not describe a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide (e.g., ""I will use X method,"" ""I have acquired Y""). The question about minimizing harm to family is a consideration, not a plan for the act itself. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not mention any past attempts. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, without a specific plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

I'm just so tired of fighting this constantly. Since my depression doesn't allow me to make any new memories, I'm constantly stuck living the old ones. It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" strongly implies death and ceasing to exist. ""My own body has given up on itself"" also suggests giving up on life.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong indicators of hopelessness (""There's no possible way to turn my life around anymore,"" ""There's literally no point in trying anymore""), exhaustion (""I'm just so tired of fighting this constantly""), and feeling trapped (""It's a cycle that I can't escape"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. ""By this time next week"" is a timeframe but not a method.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" is a direct and explicit expression of an intention to no longer be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expression ""I'll be gone"" in this context is a clear statement of intending to not be alive. It's not unclear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No explicit plan is mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" refers to a future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains strong expressions of hopelessness and a clear statement ""By this time next week I'll be gone,"" which is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive any longer.
    The definition of **Ideation** is: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post. ""I'll be gone"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive.
    The definition of **Indicator** states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide."" While ""suicide"" isn't explicitly mentioned, ""I'll be gone"" is more than a ""vague feeling about dying""; it's an explicit statement of intent to cease existing.
    Furthermore, the **Ideation** definition includes the clarification: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" In this post, a desire to die (or cease to exist) *is* expressed through ""I'll be gone."" Therefore, it should not be 'Indicator'.
    Since there is no specific plan or method mentioned, it does not qualify for 'Behavior'.
    There is no mention of past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    Thus, the post falls into the 'Ideation' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""don't make it"", ""don't want to survive another attempt"", ""want to die"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Hopelessness (""I hope I don't make it""), despair (""I just want to die""), feeling like a burden (implied by ""expensive the medical bill"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific current plan or method mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""another attempt"" clearly indicates at least one past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) -> No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""attempt"" in this context is a very strong proxy.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) -> Yes, ""I just want to die"", ""I hope I don't make it"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) -> No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) -> No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? -> It refers to a past event (""another attempt"") and current/future intentions (""I hope I don't make it"", ""I just want to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? -> Yes, the phrase ""another attempt"" signifies a past attempt has occurred.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post mentions ""another attempt"", which directly refers to a past suicide attempt. The definition of 'Attempt' is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    The post clearly describes a past attempt (""another attempt"") and also expresses current suicidal ideation/desire (""I just want to die"", ""I hope I don't make it""). Even though ""current plans"" might imply more than ideation, the rule is specific about this combination. The presence of a past attempt alongside current desire to die fits the 'Attempt' category as per the provided definition and its note.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and expresses a desire for ""death"" as an ""escape"". This clearly indicates suicidal ideation. There is no mention of a specific plan or method, nor any description of a past attempt. Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' category. It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It's not 'Behavior' because no plan is present. It's not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide attempt,"" ""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" ""testing my method"" (for suicide), ""intention of dying,"" ""stopped myself"" before ""point of no return.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""struggle to not think about,"" ""genuinely bothered me,"" ""struggle to categorize,"" ""weighing on me.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: User mentions ""testing my method"" and going ""until shortly before the point of no return."" This implies a method was known and action was taken.
    *   References to past attempts: The entire post is about two specific past events where the user took significant steps towards suicide but stopped. The user explicitly questions if these events constitute ""attempts.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide attempt,"" ""vaguely suicidal stuff"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, in the context of the past events (""intention of dying"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The exact method is not detailed, but the user refers to ""my method"" and actions taken (""testing my method,"" ""went until shortly before the point of no return""). This implies a method was chosen and acted upon.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the actions described (""testing my method,"" proceeding towards ""point of no return"") are preparations and actions towards suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post explicitly refers to past events: ""Both of these happened long enough ago."" The user states they are in a ""tenuously better situation right now.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, two distinct past events are described where the user took concrete actions towards ending their life but ultimately stopped themselves. The user is reflecting on whether these qualify as ""attempts.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post is centered on describing and reflecting upon two specific past incidents where the individual took concrete actions with suicidal intent.
    -   **Indicator** is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned and discussed.
    -   **Ideation** is incorrect because the post describes actions taken, not just thoughts or desires.
    -   **Behavior** is less fitting because the actions described are explicitly stated as past events (""happened long enough ago""), and 'Behavior' typically refers to current plans or ongoing self-harm. While the past actions were behaviors, the 'Attempt' category is specifically for past actions.
    -   **Attempt** is the most appropriate category. The definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past... When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" The user describes concrete actions taken in the past with the intention of dying (e.g., ""testing my method,"" ""went until shortly before the point of no return,"" ""went in with the intention of dying""). These go beyond ""merely thought of an attempt."" The post is a description of these past actions that could be considered attempts or aborted attempts.

The post describes past actions where the user took steps towards suicide. This aligns with the definition of ""Attempt.""

Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

        *   Yes: ""I really want to die."" and ""Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

        *   No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I really want to die.""). This fulfills a key criterion for 'ideation'.
    *   It lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which would be required for 'behavior'.
    *   It does not describe any past suicide attempts, so it's not 'attempt'.
    *   While there is general distress, the explicit statement ""I really want to die"" elevates it beyond 'indicator', which is for posts lacking explicit expressions concerning suicide or a desire to die.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a desire for life to end (""so this nightmare could all be over""). It goes beyond simple ideation by mentioning specific methods (""jump in front of a car"", ""stab myself"") and indicating active research/preparation (""looking up how to do it""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', which requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mention of a plan or specific method, or preparations. The phrase ""i wish i had the courage"" indicates a struggle, but the presence of specific methods and the act of ""looking up how to do it"" fulfills the criteria for 'Behavior'. It is not 'Attempt' as it describes current thoughts and wishes, not a past action. It is not 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is more than 'Ideation' due to the specific methods and preparation.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" and ""I want to leave and never come back"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive or to escape life.

    *   Are there signs of preparation (for self)? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I don't want to be here anymore"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer (e.g., ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad"").
    *   The definition of 'Ideation' is: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits. The phrases used are direct expressions of wanting to cease living.
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""...no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the desire to not be alive (""I don't want to be here anymore"") is an explicit indication of suicidal thoughts as per the 'Ideation' definition's clarification (""i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method for suicide, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The expressions go beyond ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" or ""vague feeling about dying"" (Indicator). They are specific statements about wanting life to end for the poster.
    *   The 'Ideation' definition's clause ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" is relevant. Here, a desire to die (or not be alive) *is* expressed.
    *   Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' because it contains explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""pull the trigger"" clearly indicates a method (gun).
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I want to die"" and ""pull the trigger"" (in context of dying).
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"".

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pull the trigger"" implies a firearm, which is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrasing ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" suggests an intention and a chosen method, even if the acquisition of the means isn't detailed. The definition of 'behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method"". ""Pull the trigger"" is a specific method.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""It will all be done after I die"", ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die""). It also mentions a specific method (""pull the trigger""). This combination fits the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method... tools/weapons (e.g. ...guns...)"". ""Pull the trigger"" clearly implies a gun.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""I hurt myself two months ago"" - past self-harm.
        *   ""my forearms with my wounds are visible"" - evidence of past self-harm.
        *   ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" - mention of death as an escape.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):
        *   ""No one cares for my Problems.""
        *   ""I couldn't hide my pain.""
        *   ""sleeping is really hard and I'm tired all the time.""
        *   ""I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness.""
        *   The statement about death implies hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific current plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""I hurt myself two months ago"" describes a past act of self-harm. The post states ""wounds are visible on forearms."" It's not explicitly stated that this act was a *suicide attempt* (i.e., done with the intent to die). The poster also says, ""I don't know why"" they did it, which adds ambiguity to the intent of that past action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" is a direct expression of seeing death as a desirable state or escape, implying a desire to not be alive or to find release in death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for a current or future suicide attempt are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of current preparation.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is identified, so it's not 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
        *   Past event: ""I hurt myself two months ago.""
        *   Current/future intentions: ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" reflects a current state of mind and desire.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? A past act of self-harm (""I hurt myself... wounds on my forearms"") is described. However, the definition of 'Attempt' category is ""describes past attempts *at suicide*."" The post does not explicitly state that the past self-harm was an attempt to end their life. The phrase ""I don't know why"" makes the suicidal intent of the past act ambiguous.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there's an explicit expression of wanting death as freedom (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""), which goes beyond general distress.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there's no mention of a specific plan or preparation for suicide.
    *   **Attempt vs. Ideation:**
        *   The statement ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" clearly fits the definition of **Ideation**: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
        *   For the **Attempt** category, the definition is ""The content describes past attempts *at suicide*."" While ""I hurt myself two months ago"" resulting in ""wounds on my forearms"" is a concrete past action of self-harm, the post does not explicitly state that this act was an attempt *to die*. The user's comment ""I don't know why [I did it]"" further obscures the specific intent of that past action as a suicide attempt. Without explicit confirmation that the past self-harm was a suicide attempt, classifying it under 'Attempt' is not directly supported by the definition.
        *   Given the explicit current suicidal ideation and the ambiguity regarding the suicidal intent of the past self-harm, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category based on the provided definitions. The current desire for death is clearly expressed.

I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much.

I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal I get"", ""conversations with myself about suicide"", ""think about suicide every day"", ""seriously consider it [suicide]"", ""expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal"". Suicide is explicitly and repeatedly mentioned.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""feel so alone"", ""sad all the time"", ""this is so much to carry alone"", ""It's too much"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I write detailed plans in my journal"". This indicates the existence and creation of plans.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone"" refers to the duration of feelings, not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"", ""suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by ""suicidal I get"", ""think about suicide every day"", ""seriously consider it"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not directly in the post, but the post states, ""I write detailed plans in my journal"". This is a clear mention of the existence of plans.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of ""writing detailed plans"" is a form of preparation.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' states it ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". The mention of ""detailed plans"" fits this.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and ongoing (""everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get"", ""I write detailed plans in my journal"", ""think about suicide every day"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   The post states, ""I write detailed plans in my journal"". This is a direct mention of having plans, which goes beyond 'ideation' (which is defined as ""without any specific plan""). The act of writing detailed plans is a form of planning and preparation.
    *   While the person expresses doubt about acting on it (""I know I would never do it""), the classification is based on the content of the post, which includes the mention of these detailed plans.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Writing ""detailed plans"" is a form of explicit planning and preparation.
    *   It is not an 'attempt' as no past action is described.
    *   Therefore, the mention of ""detailed plans"" moves this from 'ideation' to 'behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. ""I cant take it anymore"" and ""The pain is unreal"" express severe distress.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness ("":("", ""cant take it anymore"", ""pain is unreal"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): No. ""I cant take it anymore"" expresses an inability to cope with the current situation/pain, but it's not a direct statement of wanting to die or not be alive. It's an expression of overwhelming distress.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Given the lack of explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die, and the rule to lean towards 'indicator' if unclear, this points towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as we are not at 'ideation' or 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Refers to current feelings (""I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant emotional distress (""I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal."") and sadness ("":(""). However, it does not explicitly mention suicide, wanting to die, or any plans/methods. According to the definition of ""Indicator"": ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    The phrase ""I cant take it anymore"" is a strong expression of distress but doesn't cross the threshold into explicitly stating a desire to die or suicidal ideation. It falls under ""general expressions of distress"" and ""hopelessness"".

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""committing suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The tone is sarcastic and dark, implying a negative emotional state, but the primary indicator is the mention of suicide.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The post mentions being ""capable"" but not how.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""committing suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""capable of committing suicide"" implies a thought process and potential desire related to ending one's life, even if phrased with dark humor.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan is mentioned, this points away from 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current perceived capability (""I think I'm capable""), suggesting current or future potential.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide."" This rules out ""Indicator.""
    *   It expresses a thought or feeling about suicide (""capable of committing suicide"") but does not include a specific plan, method, or preparation. This fits the definition of ""Ideation.""
    *   It does not describe a specific plan or preparation, so it is not ""Behavior.""
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not ""Attempt.""
    The key is the explicit mention of suicide and the expression of being ""capable,"" which falls under suicidal thoughts or feelings without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains phrases like ""Don't want tot. Do this anymore"" and ""o just want tit to be over"". ""I wasn't to be down"" (likely ""I want to be done"" or ""I want to be down [dead]""). These phrases strongly suggest a desire for life to end or to die, although the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not explicitly used.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong emotional distress is evident: ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit"" (self-loathing), ""I don't want to be alone any more"" (loneliness, despair), ""I hate every part of my life"" (hopelessness, despair), ""I'm sick and tired"" (exhaustion, despair).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (like tools, locations, substances for suicide), or preparations are mentioned. Being ""drunk"" is mentioned as a current state/coping mechanism, not a suicide method.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. Phrases like ""Don't want tot. Do this anymore"" (implying life) and ""o just want tit to be over"" (implying life should end) are direct expressions of wanting to not be alive or for life to end. ""I wasn't to be down"" also points in this direction.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable yet, as no plan elements are present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current feelings and intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses strong negative emotions like self-loathing, hopelessness, and despair. Crucially, it includes direct expressions of wanting life to end, such as ""Don't want tot. Do this anymore"" and ""o just want tit to be over.""
    According to the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** ""...lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post *does* have direct indications of suicidal thoughts/feelings through phrases like ""want it to be over."" The rule ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" (from Ideation definition) implies that if a desire *is* expressed, it's likely not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation:** ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post well. The phrases ""Don't want tot. Do this anymore"" and ""o just want tit to be over"" are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer. No specific plan is mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** Requires mention of a plan or method, which is absent.
    *   **Attempt:** Requires description of a past attempt, which is absent.

    The key distinction is between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'. While ""suicide"" isn't explicitly named, the *desire to not be alive* is explicitly expressed. The definition of 'Ideation' covers this (""a desire to not be alive any longer""). The general dissatisfaction and hopelessness are present, but the additional explicit expressions of wanting life to end elevate it beyond 'Indicator'. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" refers to the explicit mention of the *word* ""suicide"". However, the definition of 'Ideation' itself allows for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" without the word ""suicide"". Given the directness of ""I just want it to be over,"" this is considered an explicit expression of wanting to die.
    Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation'.

    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""attempted suicide 11 times"", ""my suicide"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""hate capitalism"", ""disturb people for my own satisfaction"" (anger, perhaps a desire for impact).

    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This is a clear reference to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""attempted suicide"", ""my suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I will use my suicide"" implies a future act of suicide).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned for the future intended suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation for the future intended suicide are mentioned.
    *   The post refers to past attempts, which inherently involved methods/plans at those times, but no *current* specific plan for the *future* suicide is detailed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" (past). ""I will use my suicide"" (future intention).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the number of past attempts is specified (""11 times"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states, ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" This is a direct reference to past actions.
    The definition for ""Attempt"" states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    The post refers to past attempts (""attempted suicide 11 times"") and also mentions a current/future intention/plan (""I will use my suicide"").

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the act of attempting suicide is described as having happened three times.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states, ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This is a direct description of past suicide attempts.
    According to the definition of **Attempt**: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). ... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    The post clearly describes past attempts. It also contains current ideation (""I just want the pain to end"", ""I've just given up completely""). The rule specifies that if past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans (or strong ideation, in this context), it should be classified as 'Attempt'. The mention of three past attempts is a very strong indicator for this category.

I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable.

        *   ""I've looked into other options"" (preparation/research).
        *   Mention of ""overdosing"" (as an option, though scary).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No direct mention of the poster's own past attempts. Mark Linkous's overdose is an example, not the poster's.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""don't kill yourself"", ""failed suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through phrases like ""how to accomplish death"" and the detailed discussion of suicide methods. The overall tone strongly suggests a desire to end life due to overwhelming pain.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes:
        *   Shotgun
        *   Handguns (with specific action: ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth"")
        *   Overdosing (considered as one of the ""other options"")
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes:
        *   ""I've looked into other options"" (indicates research).
        *   Consideration of handgun calibers (""small caliber or large caliber"").
        *   Weighing the consequences/difficulties of different methods (e.g., fear of failed overdose, reason for not wanting a shotgun).
        This goes beyond passive ideation into active consideration and research of methods.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions regarding their own death. The discussion is about how the poster might ""accomplish death.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, not for the poster.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not an 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there's a clear desire to die.
    *   The post goes beyond 'Ideation'. Ideation is a desire to die *without* a specific plan. This post includes discussion of specific methods (shotgun, handgun to palate, overdose) and shows signs of research/preparation (""looked into other options,"" considering calibers).
    *   The post fits 'Behavior'. It has explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""how to accomplish death"") AND mentions specific methods (""shotgun,"" ""handguns... shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth"") and preparations (""I've looked into other options,"" considering handgun calibers). The level of detail about the handgun method (location, tool) is significant.
    *   The post is not an 'Attempt' as it does not describe a past suicide attempt made by the poster.

The detailed consideration of methods, including specific actions like ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth,"" and research into ""other options"" and handgun calibers, elevates this from mere ideation to behavior involving planning and method consideration.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a strong euphemism for wanting to die. The word ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"" is not explicitly used.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""Can't do any of it!"" suggests overwhelm and hopelessness. ""Just don't want this anymore"" indicates despair and a desire to escape the current situation.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrase ""wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a very clear and common expression of a desire to die. The 'Ideation' definition includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". This phrase fits that definition.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is present, so it's not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and intentions (""just wanna..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up,"" which is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of 'Ideation' (""...explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."").
    *   It goes beyond ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" or ""a vague feeling about dying"" (which would be 'Indicator'). The desire for life to end is clearly stated.
    *   No specific plan or method is mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The 'Ideation' category definition (""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"") implies that if a desire to die IS expressed (as it is here), it should be considered for 'Ideation' (if no plan is present).
    *   Even though the word ""suicide"" is not used, the desire to die is explicit.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""scared"" (repeated), ""so tired of everything"", ""tired of pretending"", ""tired of lying"", ""tired of being scared"", ""What's the point"" (implies hopelessness).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The user asks ""Can someone please help me work out what to do,"" suggesting a lack of a plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrase ""I want to die"" is an explicit expression of a desire to die.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   The post explicitly states ""I have a plan"" and provides details about knowing the method (""how""), means (""what I need""), location (""where""), and timing/preparations (""when I can run away"", ""Tuesday""). This goes beyond 'ideation', which is defined as *without* any specific plan.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". This post fits this definition because it explicitly states ""I have a plan"" and elaborates on knowing the components of that plan (how, what, where, when).

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out?

This post *does* contain direct indications of suicidal thoughts/feelings through the expressed desire to die/not exist. Even though the word ""suicide"" itself is not used, the phrases ""want to die"" and ""want to not exist"" are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, as covered by the 'Ideation' definition.
    It is not **Behavior** because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide.

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive.

Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""crashing into another car"" is a specific method. A car, in this context, serves as a tool.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates a recurring impulse and a state of being on the verge of acting on the method. While not a detailed preparation like writing a note, it's more than passive ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings (""I want..."") and ongoing or recurrent intentions/impulses (""frequently come close to doing it"").

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I'm going to kill myself."")
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I'm going to kill myself."")

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations are mentioned (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). ""Only a matter of when"" refers to timing, not a plan or method.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, there is no explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when."")
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states ""I'm going to kill myself,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. However, it does not mention any specific plan, method, tools, or location. The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" indicates intent but not a concrete plan. According to the definitions:
    *   Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Fits 'Ideation' because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die, but no specific plan.
    *   Not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific method or preparations.
    *   Not 'Attempt' because it refers to future intentions, not a past action.
    Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying: ""Death is an option,"" ""if somehow I got an accident and die,"" ""not the worst outcome.""
    *   Emotional indicators: Acceptance of death, passive wish for death through accident (""not the worst outcome"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Explicitly states ""I won't commit,"" so no active plan or preparation.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The term ""suicidal thought"" is mentioned in a question (""Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought?""). The act of suicide by the poster is not explicitly stated as an intention; in fact, they say ""I won't commit.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Death is an option"" and ""if somehow I got an accident and die... It's not the worst outcome"" expresses a passive acceptance or desire for death, indicating a diminished will to live. This is an explicit expression of a feeling about their own death being acceptable.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. Death by ""accident"" is mentioned, but not as a plan they will enact.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. Explicitly denied (""I won't commit"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current thoughts and feelings.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress. It explicitly discusses death as an ""option"" and an acceptable outcome for the writer (""not the worst outcome"").
    *   **Indicator** states: ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The phrase ""if somehow I got an accident and die... It's not the worst outcome"" *is* an explicit expression and indication of a suicidal thought or feeling (passive ideation).
    *   **Ideation** states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
        *   ""Death is an option"" and ""if I got an accident and die... It's not the worst outcome"" are explicit expressions of thoughts/feelings where death is acceptable, implying a diminished desire to live. This fits the definition.
        *   The post explicitly states ""I won't commit,"" which aligns with ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   **Behavior** is ruled out because there's no mention of a plan or method the person intends to use.
    *   **Attempt** is ruled out as there's no mention of past attempts.

    The statement ""if somehow I got an accident and die... It's not the worst outcome"" is a clear expression of a thought/feeling about their own death being acceptable, which falls under suicidal ideation (passive). It's more than a ""vague feeling about dying"" (Indicator); it's a specific contemplation and acceptance of their own death. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" refers to the mention of suicide itself. Here, while ""suicide"" as an act isn't planned, ""suicidal thoughts or feelings"" *are* explicitly expressed through the acceptance of death. The definition of Ideation covers ""vague thoughts about not wanting to live,"" which this aligns with.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I wish i didnt have to do this"" (implies distress, feeling forced/resigned)

    The post explicitly mentions wanting to ""kill me"" (suicide). It also clearly states a plan (""planned this,"" ""stuff prepared"") and a specific timeframe (""Tonight""). This combination of explicit suicidal intent and a plan/preparation falls under the 'Behavior' category. It's not just ideation because of the preparation and timing. It's not an attempt because it's a future-oriented statement about an imminent action.

It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post includes ""I don't always wish to be gone"". This implies that sometimes the person *does* wish to be gone, which is a veiled reference to wanting to die or not be alive. No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong emotional distress is present: ""I'm not ok"", ""haven't been ok for a very long time"", ""cold, broken heart"", ""dragged my face through the muds of life"", ""confused and terrified"", ""somber loneliness"".

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant emotional distress and hopelessness.
    *   The statement ""I don't always wish to be gone"" directly implies that there are times when the writer *does* wish to be gone. This constitutes an expression of a desire to not be alive, which fits the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   While ""suicide"" is not explicitly mentioned, the desire to ""be gone"" (not be alive) is expressed. The Ideation definition clarifies that ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" is what is looked for.
    *   It is not **Indicator** because Indicator ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" ""Wishing to be gone"" is an indication of suicidal thoughts/feelings (a desire to not be alive). The rule for Indicator states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Here, a desire to ""be gone"" is expressed.
    *   It is not **Behavior** because there is no mention of any plan, method, or preparation.

While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""slit my wrists"", ""my death"", ""get it over with"", ""won't have much time to live"", ""Goodbye"". These are direct references to self-harm and death.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""distant to everyone"", ""not a good person"", ""my death will only benefit people"", ""took me years o decide this but ow i just want to get it over with"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a belief that death is a solution or benefit.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""slit my wrists"" is the act. The method includes ""Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines"". Preparations include ""looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is"", ""marked where the my artery should be"", and ""typed this out before and will post it once i have done it"" (preparing a suicide note).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit references to *other* past attempts. The post is about a current/just-occurred attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""slit my wrists"" is a suicidal act. ""My death"" and ""get it over with"" in this context clearly refer to suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""my death will only benefit people"", ""i just want to get it over with"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - Yes, method: ""slit my wrists"". Tools: ""dremel"", ""saw atachment"". Target: ""radial artery"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - Yes, research (""looked at many different pictures and graphs""), marking the body (""marked where the my artery should be""), preparing a note (""typed this out before and will post it once i have done it"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - The post states, ""I just slit my wrists."" This indicates an action that has just been completed. It also says, ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it,"" meaning the act of slitting wrists precedes the posting. Therefore, from the perspective of someone reading the post, the act is in the past (albeit very recent). ""if you are seeing this then its already too late"" further reinforces that the action has occurred.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - The post describes a *current* attempt that has just occurred. It does not describe *other, older* past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post describes a concrete action of self-harm (""I just slit my wrists"") that has already taken place. It includes a specific method and clear preparations.
    -   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and detailed.
    -   It is not 'Ideation' because a specific action and method are described as having been carried out, not just thought about.
    -   It could be 'Behavior' as it ""exhibits self-harming behavior"". However, 'Behavior' also implies ongoing actions or plans not yet fully executed from the post's narrative time.
    -   'Attempt' is defined as ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. A concrete action need to have happened in the past"". The phrase ""I just slit my wrists"" means the action has happened. The statement ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it"" means that at the time of posting/reading, the act of slitting wrists is in the past. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' as a description of a concrete suicidal action that has occurred. The immediacy (""just"") still places the action in the past relative to the communication of the event.

    Given that the action (""slit my wrists"") is stated as having occurred (""I *just* slit my wrists"", ""will post it *once i have done it*""), this qualifies as a description of a past attempt, making 'Attempt' the most fitting category.

    The author explicitly states they are suicidal (""I'm suicidal myself"") and expresses a desire to not continue living (""I don't want to keep going myself""). This is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts. However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation to act on these thoughts.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses strong feelings of blame towards others (""it's everyone else's fault,"" ""Everything is thier fault"") and a sense of being mistreated (""treating me different"").

    *   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a suicidal thought.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   It does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    *   Since suicide is explicitly mentioned along with a desire (conditional) to die, it goes beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   The definition of 'Ideation' is ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""kill myself"" fits this definition as an explicit expression of a suicidal thought, even if presented conditionally.

It really took everything of me to be so vulnerable in such a dark moment, but it's gone.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states, ""i wanted to die when i made that post"". It also says, ""i just don't want to die, but even before and now after that, i have no hope.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""cruel"", ""don't know what to do"", ""hopelessness"", ""vulnerable"", ""dark moment"", ""desperate"", ""impossible to find someone to talk to"", ""how to go on when you can't"", ""feel like breaking"", ""meaningless torture"", ""no hope"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No specific past attempts are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i wanted to die when i made that post"" is a direct expression of having wanted to die. Even though the current post says ""i just don't want to die"", it explicitly mentions a recent past desire to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The expression ""wanted to die"" is quite direct, making it an indicator of suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Not applicable as no plan is hinted at.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""i wanted to die when i made that post"" refers to a feeling during a very recent past event (writing the deleted draft). The current feelings are mixed (""i just don't want to die"") but still full of ""no hope"" and desperation.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains the explicit statement ""i wanted to die when i made that post"". This is an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which fits the definition of **Ideation**.
    *   It is not **Indicator** because ""wanted to die"" is an explicit expression, not just general distress or vague feelings about death. The definition of Indicator states ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" ""Wanted to die"" is a direct indication.
    *   It is not **Behavior** because there is no mention of any plan, method, or preparation.
    *   It is not **Attempt** because no past action of attempting suicide is described.

    The post explicitly states a desire to die (""i wanted to die"") that the person experienced when writing the deleted draft. This expression of a suicidal feeling, even if referring to a very recent past moment, qualifies the post as Ideation. The current statement ""i just don't want to die"" is noted, but the post *does contain* an explicit expression of suicidal ideation.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""feel like shit"", ""failure"", ""letting everyone down"", ""broken and lifeless"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None explicitly mentioned. The phrase ""am trying to kill myself at this point"" indicates intent but not a specific method or plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""trying to kill myself"").

    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""trying to kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    *   It also mentions ""ready to say goodbye,"" further indicating a desire to die.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations. The phrase ""am trying to kill myself"" is a strong statement of intent/desire but doesn't detail *how*.
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because it refers to current feelings/intentions, not a past action.
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because, according to the definition, 'Behavior' ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". This is absent.
    *   Therefore, it fits 'Ideation': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide. This can range from vague thoughts about not wanting to live to stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life (albeit without a specific plan how to do so).""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself"", ""fear of death"", ""scared to die"", ""emptiness after death"", ""hope that I don't wake up"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""hate it"", ""scared"", ""cry myself to sleep"", ""neverending cycle"", ""I'm done"". Strong despair and hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""parents ... taken any means they can think of."" The poster states, ""I could do it right now."" However, no specific method, tool, location, or substance is mentioned by the poster as *their* current plan. The ""means"" are what parents removed, not what the poster currently has or plans to use.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""killing myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes (""killing myself"", ""hope that I don't wake up"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No. The poster says ""I could do it right now"" but does not specify *how*. The ""means"" mentioned are in the context of what parents removed, not a current plan of the poster.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No explicit signs of current preparation by the poster.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Given the lack of a *specific* method or plan mentioned by the poster for their current intent, this rule applies.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current/future intentions (""I could do it right now"", ""hope that I don't wake up"", ""I'm done"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and wanting to die, so it's not 'indicator'.
    *   It clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, fitting 'ideation'.
    *   For 'behavior', the definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".
    *   The statement ""I could do it right now"" expresses strong intent and perceived capability, but it does not include a specific method or plan (e.g., ""I could do it right now with X,"" or ""by going to Y""). The ""means"" mentioned are those removed by parents, not a current active plan by the individual.
    *   Since no specific plan or method is articulated by the poster for their current intention, and the rule is to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain about an explicit plan, 'ideation' is the most fitting category.
    *   It is not 'attempt' as no past action is described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""killing myself"" is explicitly mentioned in the context of a past intention. ""Set a date"" also implies past suicidal planning.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Past emotions described include ""desperate,"" ""extraordinarily painful."" Current emotions are more positive: ""made the decision to live,"" ""light at the end of the tunnel.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""my letters were written"" and ""I had a set plan."" These are clear signs of past preparation. No specific *method* (e.g., pills, weapon) is detailed, but ""letters written"" counts as preparation (like a suicide note).
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post states, ""I came extraordinarily close to killing myself... I was days away from going through with [the plan]."" This indicates a plan and preparation that were *not* carried out. According to the definition of 'Attempt' (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past""), this does not qualify as an attempt, as the action was not initiated.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""killing myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, referring to the past (""came extraordinarily close to killing myself""). The current sentiment is the opposite.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""letters were written"" and ""had a set plan"" are explicit signs of past preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to past events and past intentions regarding suicide. The current intention is explicitly stated as ""I made the decision to live.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The post describes being ""days away"" from executing a plan, meaning the action constituting an attempt did not occur. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide (""killing myself"") is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The definition of 'Attempt' requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past."" The post states, ""I was days away from going through with [the plan],"" indicating the plan was not executed and no concrete action of self-harm was taken.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The post describes a past situation. In that past situation, there were explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"") *and* explicit preparations (""letters were written,"" ""had a set plan"").
        *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts... but without any specific plan.""
        *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...).""
    *   The post's content *includes* a description of past suicidal thoughts accompanied by past planning and preparations (""letters were written,"" ""set plan""). Even though this refers to a past state and the person is currently better, the post *contains* these elements. Since 'Attempt' is ruled out because no action was taken, and the description includes planning/preparation, it fits the 'Behavior' category more closely than 'Ideation'. The definitions of 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' refer to what ""the content includes,"" and are not strictly limited to current states (unlike 'Attempt,' which is for past actions). The presence of ""letters written"" (a form of suicide note/preparation) and a ""set plan"" moves it beyond mere ideation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""not doing it years ago"" (implies suicide), ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it."" These phrases strongly suggest suicidal thoughts.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Anger (""angry at myself,"" ""angry that it would be considered selfish""), regret, persistent negative feelings (""fairly regularly since about 2012"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations for a current or future act are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The post mentions ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it."" This refers to *not* acting on past suicidal thoughts, or wishing they had, rather than describing a concrete past attempt that failed.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, phrases like ""not doing it years ago"" and ""done it the first time I thought about it"" in the context of ""wished I wasn't alive"" are strong and clear euphemisms for suicide. So, yes, implicitly but clearly.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""wished I wasn't alive"" and ""wanted things to be over fairly regularly.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expressions are clear enough to move beyond 'indicator'. The desire to not be alive is directly stated.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan is mentioned, so it's not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post heavily reflects on past feelings and regrets (""years ago,"" ""since about 2012,"" ""the first time I thought about it""). It expresses a persistent wish to have died in the past. While it expresses current anger, it doesn't state a current plan or immediate intention to act. The suicidal thoughts described are long-standing.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The post describes *regret for not acting* on suicidal thoughts in the past (""not doing it,"" ""wish that I had just done it""). This is different from describing an actual attempt that was made. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" in the past, and ""merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to not be alive (""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over"").
    *   It refers to past suicidal thoughts (""not doing it years ago,"" ""wish that I had just done it the first time I thought about it"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method for suicide.
    *   It does not describe a concrete past attempt, but rather regret for not having acted on past thoughts.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

    *   Emotional indicators: ""depressed"", ""sucks so much"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine"". This is a significant preparation (a suicide note).

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are not mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine"" is a clear sign of preparation, specifically a suicide note. Thinking about cancelling administrative things is also a form of preparation.
    *   The 'Behavior' category definition includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""everytime i think about killing myself"", ""times where i just get ready to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and wanting to die, so it is not 'Indicator'.

    *   The post also mentions a significant preparation: ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This falls under ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"" as described in the 'Behavior' category definition.
    *   While no specific *method* of suicide is detailed, the presence of a suicide note as a preparation, combined with explicit suicidal thoughts, meets the criteria for 'Behavior'. The administrative thoughts are a deterrent but do not negate the preparations already made or the current suicidal state.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
    *   The distinction between 'Ideation' (thoughts without a plan) and 'Behavior' (thoughts *with* a plan or preparations) is key. The written note is a clear preparation.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The user states they ""fucked up"", ""got in trouble woth my family"" and feels ""never been more suicidal in my life"". This indicates significant distress and heightened suicidal feeling.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and expresses a current, strong suicidal feeling (""never been more suicidal in my life"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses extreme dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and a sense of being oppressed (""slaves,"" ""prison colony,"" ""fascist regime""). It uses very strong, negative language and comparisons (Auschwitz, Hitler). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any self-harm intent. According to the definition of ""Indicator"": ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits the description of ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness"" without any explicit mention of suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Heaven seems really good right now"", ""I just want to die and go to Heaven"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm nobodies first choice or even second choice, nobody seems to think about me at all""), despair (""it just hurts so much""), loneliness (""I feel so alone in the world""), fear (""Its seems so terrifying"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., the word ""suicide"", ""kill myself"")? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes: ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else.""
    *   The definition of Ideation includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive. The Indicator definition states ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"". However, the Ideation definition clarifies that ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" counts as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts. ""I just want to die"" is a direct and explicit expression of wanting to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan or method is mentioned, it would not be 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions/desires (""I just want to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I just want to die and go to Heaven""). This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"").
    *   It does not contain any specific plan or method, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the desire to die is explicit, making it more than 'Indicator'. The 'Indicator' definition states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" ""I just want to die"" is a direct indication of suicidal thoughts/feelings. The Ideation definition's condition ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" implies that if a desire to die *is* expressed, it leans away from 'indicator'. The post clearly expresses a desire to die.

I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""kill me"", ""end my life""). However, it does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. It is not describing a past attempt. According to the definitions:
    - It's not 'indicator' because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
    - It fits 'ideation' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive, without a specific plan.
    - It's not 'behavior' because there is no mention of a plan or method.
    - It's not 'attempt' because it doesn't describe a past action.
    Therefore, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone.

    The post mentions a specific method (""a gun"") and states it ""would solve everything."" This constitutes a ""specific idea of how to commit suicide"" using a ""specific method.""

I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post repeatedly mentions ""suicide"" (e.g., ""Why is suicide viewed..."", ""suicide is seen as a solution"", ""convince people that suicide isn't totally evil"", ""If suicide is so immoral""). It also mentions ""die prematurely"", ""end my life"", ""taking their own life"", ""kill themselves"", ""wanting to end my life"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses a strong justification for suicide as a personal choice and an ""escape"". It conveys frustration with societal views on suicide and a feeling of not being understood or supported (""No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support."").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post is a philosophical discussion and personal justification.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: There are no references to past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The word ""suicide"" is used multiple times.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The author states, ""For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem."" and ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it."" and ""talking about wanting to end my life"".

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no mention of a plan, so this rule reinforces that it's not 'behavior'.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and the author's desire to die (""myself included who would rather die prematurely"", ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of past attempts. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The author clearly expresses a desire to end their life and sees suicide as a solution for themselves, but does not detail how they would do it.

318,"""your not cutting your faking it!"" stares at my arm motherfuckerly. Im tired of all the people who miraculously believe that im either cutting for attention or faking it. I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""cutting,"" ""self harm,"" and ""scars."" The author states, ""I've had issues with self harm in the past"" and describes a specific past incident of self-harm: ""i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm"". The author also expresses, ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore.""
    *   Emotional indicators: Strong emotional distress is indicated by phrases like ""tired of all the people,"" ""pain,"" ""numb and empty inside,"" ""cried myself to sleep.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations (for suicide): No specific current plans, methods, or preparations for *suicide* are mentioned. The past self-harm involved cutting.
    *   References to past attempts: The post describes a past self-harm incident (""a few months ago... i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain""). The stated intent was ""to relieve some of the pain,"" which is characteristic of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) rather than an explicit suicide attempt (an attempt to die).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS (by author about self):**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used by the author in reference to themselves.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is a direct expression of questioning the value of life and can be interpreted as an expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION (for suicide):**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned (for suicide)? No current methods for suicide are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation (for suicide)? No current signs of preparation for suicide.
    *   The post does describe self-harm (cutting) as a behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to past self-harm (""issues with self harm in the past,"" ""a few months ago"").
    *   It also expresses current feelings and ideation (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"").
    *   The past self-harm described was to ""relieve some of the pain,"" not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This is likely too low given the explicit questioning of life's worth (""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"") and the discussion of self-harm.
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (""wonder if it's even worth it anymore""). This category applies if there's no specific plan for suicide AND no exhibition of self-harming behavior (as per the 'Behavior' definition's structure).
    *   **Behavior:** The definition is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide OR exhibits self-harming behavior.""
        *   ""Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"": Yes, ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore.""
        *   ""Mentions a plan to commit suicide"": No.
        *   ""OR exhibits self-harming behavior"": Yes. The post extensively discusses the author's self-harm (""cutting,"" ""self harm,"" ""issues with self harm in the past,"" ""dozen scars,"" specific past incident). Describing this history and current struggle with self-harm constitutes ""exhibiting self-harming behavior"" in the context of the post's content.
        Therefore, the conditions for 'Behavior' (suicidal thoughts + exhibiting self-harming behavior) are met.
    *   **Attempt:** This category is for ""past attempts at suicide."" The described past self-harm was ""to try to relieve some of the pain."" This is more aligned with NSSI than an explicit suicide attempt where the intent is to die. Without clear suicidal intent for the past act, it doesn't fit 'Attempt'.

    The post combines suicidal ideation (""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"") with extensive discussion and description of self-harming behavior. This fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal ideation"", ""act on my suicidal thoughts"", ""danger to myself"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""depressive spell"", ""spiraling worse"", ""depression time scales"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The user mentions wanting to go to the hospital *instead* of acting on thoughts.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal ideation"", ""suicidal thoughts"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" imply a desire to not be alive or thoughts about ending life.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The user is considering seeking help (hospital).
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions/thoughts (""suicidal ideation"", ""act on my suicidal thoughts at this point"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"". This clearly indicates more than just general distress. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The user is actually contemplating going to the hospital to *avoid* acting on these thoughts. There is no mention of past attempts. Therefore, the category is ""Ideation"" as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead"". The post also mentions ""started to do heroin pretty much daily,"" which is a highly self-destructive behavior and can be considered a form of slow self-harm or a method leading to death, especially given the context.
    *   Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I hope I die soon""), despair, anger (""Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel!""), strong aversion to an upcoming situation (being institutionalized and forced medication).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""heroin"" is mentioned as a substance being used ""pretty much daily"". Heroin is a lethal drug. The daily use, combined with the desire to die ""soon"" (before being institutionalized in 4 weeks), suggests this is the method.
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit mention of a past suicide attempt. Feeling like an antipsychotic ""kills me inside"" is a description of a negative experience with medication, not a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes: ""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead"". These are direct expressions of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""heroin"" is a specific lethal drug. The behavior is ""started to do heroin pretty much daily"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the ongoing daily use of heroin can be seen as preparation or an ongoing action with a lethal substance, especially in conjunction with the expressed desire to die soon.
    *   The post links the desire to die soon with the current daily heroin use, especially in the context of avoiding forced institutionalization. This constitutes a plan involving a specific method (heroin) and an ongoing behavior (daily use).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current behavior (""started to do heroin pretty much daily"") and future intentions/expectations (""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead""), so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post does not describe a past suicide attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is for suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.
    *   'Behavior' is for suicidal thoughts *with* a plan or self-harming behavior, including a specific method or preparations.
    *   The post mentions:
        1.  Explicit suicidal thoughts (""I hope I die soon"", ""Soon I will be finally dead"").
        2.  A specific method (""heroin"", which is a lethal drug).
        3.  An ongoing behavior/preparation involving this method (""started to do heroin pretty much daily"").
    *   The daily use of heroin, a lethal substance, coupled with the explicit desire to die ""soon"" and the statement ""Soon I will be finally dead,"" constitutes more than just ideation. It describes an ongoing, dangerous behavior with a specific lethal method that aligns with the expressed suicidal intent. This fits the definition of 'Behavior', which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs...)"". Daily heroin use is a self-harming behavior involving a lethal drug.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""hitting the brain stem"" with a ""gun"" clearly implies a lethal act aimed at oneself.
    *   Note emotional indicators: ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you... I genuinely do not care for any of those things"" indicates detachment, hopelessness, and a dismissal of reasons to live.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions a specific method (""gun"") and a specific target (""brain stem""). It is actively seeking information on *how* to carry out this plan (""What position of the gun is best..."").
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Asking how to position a gun to hit the brain stem is a very direct, albeit implicit, expression of wanting to die by that method. The context makes the suicidal intent clear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""gun"" is a specific method/tool. ""Hitting the brain stem"" is a specific detail of the plan to ensure lethality.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of asking for specific information on *how* to use the gun effectively (""What position..."") is a sign of planning and preparation. The user is seeking to operationalize a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The user is asking for information for a potential future action.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear intent to die.
    *   It specifies a lethal method (""gun"") and a specific target (""brain stem"").
    *   The user is actively seeking information to refine this plan, which constitutes ""explicit planning"" and ""preparations taken"" as per the 'Behavior' definition (""tools/weapons (e.g. ...guns...) suitable to end ones life"").
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because the suicidal intent and desire to die are clear, even if the word ""suicide"" isn't used. The context of ""hitting the brain stem"" with a ""gun"" is unambiguous.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because there's more than just a desire to die; there's a specific method mentioned and active inquiry into its execution. 'Ideation' is ""without any specific plan."" Here, a ""gun"" and ""hitting the brain stem"" constitute a specific plan, and the question is about refining it.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' as it refers to current/future intentions, not a past action.
    *   The mention of a specific weapon (""gun"") and the query about its effective use (""position... for hitting the brain stem"") clearly falls under ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"" for the 'Behavior' category.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself"" refers to ongoing, current ideation. ""self harm scars"" refers to past behavior.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Past self-harm is indicated by ""scars,"" but it's not described as a specific suicide attempt (e.g., an overdose).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post mentions ""self harm scars,"" which is evidence of past self-harm. However, it does not describe a specific past *suicide attempt* as per the 'Attempt' definition (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)""). Self-harm is not always a suicide attempt. So, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (""thought about killing myself"").
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide **or exhibits self-harming behavior**.""
        *   It has explicit suicidal thoughts.
        *   It does not mention a plan.
        *   It mentions ""my self harm scars."" This phrase ""exhibits"" (makes known or shows evidence of) ""self-harming behavior"" (the actions that led to the scars). Even though the scars are from past behavior, the post is currently exhibiting this information.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""don't know what the fuck to do anymore"", ""feel like trash"", ""sick of life"" all indicate severe distress, hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Let's just do it"" implies an intention to act, but does not specify a method, location, or preparation.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific plan is mentioned, this leans towards 'ideation'.
4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and expresses a desire to die (""my only way out is killing myself""). This clearly goes beyond 'indicator'.
    There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. ""Let's just do it"" is an expression of resolve but lacks the specifics required for 'behavior'.

And to top things off. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""I just want this pain to end."" It also mentions ""My best friend drowned"" (referring to another person) and his mother's heart stopping (""hopefully restart until it doesn't""). No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"" by the author for themselves.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post is laden with strong emotional indicators of distress: ""fighting it but I can't anymore,"" feeling ""stuck,"" being reminded of ""doing nothing,"" trauma from witnessing a friend drown and saving the person responsible, mother's severe illness, father being a pedophile, family wanting nothing to do with him, alcoholism. The overarching sentiment is extreme hopelessness, despair, and a desire for suffering to cease.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None are mentioned for the author.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The phrase ""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore"" combined with ""I just want this pain to end"" is a direct and explicit expression of wanting the current unbearable state of suffering to cease. In this context, it signifies a desire for life, as currently experienced and defined by overwhelming pain, to end. This aligns with ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" as specified in the 'Ideation' definition.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan or method is identified, it would not be 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current suffering and a current desire for the pain to end.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of overwhelming hopelessness and suffering (""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore"").
    *   The statement ""I just want this pain to end"" is interpreted as an explicit expression of a desire for the current state of unbearable life to cease, which is equivalent to ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   While the word ""suicide"" itself is not used, the 'Ideation' category includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The combination of phrases used expresses this desire explicitly.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not qualify for 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it does not qualify for 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond 'Indicator' because ""I just want this pain to end"" in the context of ""I can't anymore"" is more than a ""general expression of distress"" or a ""vague feeling about dying""; it's a direct expression of wanting the current painful existence to stop.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal"", ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"", ""time for me to fucking go"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Frustration (""Fuck this""), despair, feeling invalidated.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. ""Past this summer"" is a timeframe but not a plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""suicidal"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes (""don't think I'll make it past this summer"", ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No explicit plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current feelings and future intentions (""don't think I'll make it past this summer"", ""time for me to fucking go"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions being ""suicidal"" and expresses a desire to die or not continue living (""don't think I'll make it past this summer"", ""time for me to fucking go""). This clearly fits the definition of 'ideation' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.
    It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    It is not 'behavior' because no specific plan or method is mentioned.
    It is not 'attempt' because there is no mention of a past attempt.

327,"It's over for me. I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry. I'm so sorry. There is no putting me back together. Im broken. I'm damaged. I'm all fucked up. I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""me to kill myself"", ""I should have killed myself a long time ago"", ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work"", ""I promise I wont fail this time"", ""I have heard hanging is painless"", ""Gonna be gone after this weekend"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""It's over for me"", ""fucked up garbage"", ""emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane"", ""drowning in depression, in self hatred"", ""cant take it anymore"", ""I am trash"", ""I hate myself too"", ""Im broken. Im damaged. Im all fucked up"".

    *   References to past attempts: ""I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""killed myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""It's over for me"", ""I should have killed myself"", ""Gonna be gone after this weekend"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I'm gonna buy the right stuff"", ""Say my goodbyes"", ""Gonna be gone after this weekend"".
    *   This clearly indicates a plan and preparation, which would point to 'behavior' if not for other factors.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. It refers to past attempts (""I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."") and clearly states current/future intentions (""I promise I wont fail this time. I'm gonna buy the right stuff. Say my goodbyes... Gonna be gone after this weekend."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This indicates a concrete action happened in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains:
    - Explicit mentions of suicide (""kill myself"").
    - Explicit expressions of wanting to die (""Gonna be gone after this weekend"").
    - A specific method (""hanging"") and preparations (""buy the right stuff"", ""say goodbyes"", timeline ""after this weekend""). This would qualify for 'Behavior'.
    - A clear statement of past attempts: ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."" This qualifies for 'Attempt'.

    The rule for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    This post clearly refers to past attempts (""I tried. I tried. But it didn't work."") and also clearly mentions current plans (""I'm gonna buy the right stuff. Say my goodbyes to the one I love. Gonna be gone after this weekend."").
    Therefore, according to the provided rules, the category is 'Attempt'.

But I'm really grateful to be able to meet you all, if by any chance there is another life, i wish we could hang out again. But this life for me isn't it. Ill update back on this post innnn 8 yrs or so. Maybe? Who knows. No promises &gt;:) anyway, I hope you all have a great day and thank you for reading to whatever this is",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""killing myself"", ""Adios i can't"", ""this life for me isn't it"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied despair (""It's not worth it""), but also a sense of future planning and potential for change (""I still have a long time to rethink my decisions. I can still seek out help"").
    *   Specific plans/methods: No specific method mentioned. The ""plan"" is a future timeframe (""at 30 or 25"").
    *   Past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""killing myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""killing myself"", ""Adios i can't"", ""this life for me isn't it"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No current preparations. The ""plan"" is a future conditional one.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions (""planning on killing myself at 30 or 25"", ""Ill update back on this post innnn 8 yrs or so"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and a desire to not be alive (""this life for me isn't it""). This points towards at least 'ideation'.
    *   It mentions a ""plan"" (""planning on killing myself at 30 or 25""). However, this is a very long-term, conditional plan without any specific method or current preparation. The definition of 'behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The timeframe alone, especially one so far in the future and conditional, doesn't meet the threshold for 'behavior' as it lacks a specific method or current preparation.
    *   The user explicitly states they have time to rethink and seek help, which makes the ""plan"" less immediate or concrete in terms of method.
    *   Therefore, it fits 'ideation' because there's an explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts, but no *specific current plan with method/means*. The ""plan"" is more of a future conditional thought.

329,"Been teetering on the edge lately. Because as a queer person I'm perceived as male and a threat. Now I know why the suicide rate for men is four times as high as for women, and I have so much respect for cismen who have to deal with being eyed with suspicion.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide rate for men"" is mentioned. ""Teetering on the edge"" is a strong idiom suggesting being close to a crisis or breakdown.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses feelings of being perceived as a threat, leading to distress (""teetering on the edge""). There's an understanding and empathy for why others might feel suicidal (""Now I know why the suicide rate for men is four times as high..."").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide rate for men."" However, this is a general observation and not a direct statement about the poster's own suicidal actions or immediate intent.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""Teetering on the edge"" implies being very close to a breaking point, which *could* include suicidal feelings, but it is not an explicit statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I am thinking about killing myself."" It's a strong metaphor for severe distress.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" is a general expression of severe distress. While it's concerning, it doesn't explicitly state suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. The mention of ""suicide rate"" is contextual to their feelings of being perceived as a threat, rather than a direct expression of their own suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   This step is not relevant if the post doesn't reach 'ideation' with a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" refers to current or recent feelings.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress (""teetering on the edge lately"") and connects this distress to an understanding of suicide rates in a specific demographic. However, it does not contain an *explicit* expression of the poster's own suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" is a strong indicator of distress and potential crisis, but it's not a direct statement of suicidal ideation. The mention of ""suicide rate"" is an observation linked to their personal experience of distress, not a personal declaration of wanting to commit suicide.
    According to the definition of ""Indicator"": ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    ""Teetering on the edge"" is a general expression of severe distress and hopelessness. While it is very concerning, it does not explicitly state ""I am thinking about suicide"" or ""I want to die."" Given the rule to lean towards 'indicator' when explicit mention of suicide (by the poster about themselves) is unclear, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category. The distress is high, but the explicit suicidal ideation is not stated.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide is a coward way to go out"", ""if I'm gone within 24 hours"". ""Gone"" in this context, following the mention of suicide, strongly implies death.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Sarcasm (""Thanks mom.""), resignation, sadness ("":(.""), farewell (""Peace out all"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""within 24 hours"" indicates a timeframe, which is a form of planning. The post itself, with its farewell, can be seen as a preparation (like a note). No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon) is mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes (""suicide is a coward way to go out"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes (""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No specific method is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - Yes. ""within 24 hours"" sets a timeframe, which is a planning element. The message ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :(."" acts as a farewell or a form of suicide note, which is a preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current/future intentions (""if I'm gone within 24 hours"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a clear intent to die (""if I'm gone""). It also includes elements of planning or preparation: a specific timeframe (""within 24 hours"") and a farewell message (""Peace out all..."").
    According to the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method *or preparations taken* (e.g. suicide note...).""
    The timeframe (""within 24 hours"") and the farewell message (""Peace out all..."") constitute ""preparations taken"" and a brief mention of a plan (timing). While a specific *method* isn't detailed, the presence of a timeframe for the intended action and a farewell message moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which is ""without any specific plan""). The phrase ""within 24 hours"" indicates a degree of planning regarding imminence.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""it's killing me"" is present. This is often an idiom for extreme distress rather than a literal statement about dying or suicide. No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses significant distress, self-hatred (""I hate myself""), feelings of being trapped, helplessness, and desperation due to ongoing abuse.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. ""It's killing me"" is a strong expression of suffering but not a direct statement of wanting to die or not be alive in the context of suicide.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Given the absence of explicit suicide mentions, this leans towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   This step is less relevant as 'ideation' criteria (explicit desire to die) are not met.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past abuse and current ongoing abuse and distress. The ""it's killing me"" refers to the current impact of the situation. No future suicidal intentions are stated.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post describes severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped due to abuse. The phrase ""it's killing me"" expresses the intensity of this suffering. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or ending one's life. According to the definition, ""Indicator"" includes ""general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""self harm"", ""harming"", ""bloodying myself up now"", ""kill myself"", ""do it now"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Distress, relapse, feeling of failure, hopelessness (""What the hell makes them think this won't end badly"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""bloodying myself up now"" describes current self-harm. ""kill myself"" and ""I should do it now"" express intent. While a *specific method for suicide* distinct from the current self-harm isn't detailed, the self-harm itself is an action.
    *   References to past attempts: ""four months without self harm"" refers to past self-harm, not explicitly a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The post mentions ""bloodying myself up now,"" which is a description of current self-harming behavior. While it doesn't detail a *future* suicide method beyond this, the current self-harm is a behavior.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of ""bloodying myself up now"" is a current, ongoing action.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior"". The post clearly states ""I'm bloodying myself up now"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past self-harm, current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now""), and current/imminent suicidal intentions (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Past *self-harm* is mentioned, but not explicitly a past *suicide attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now"").
    Crucially, it also describes current self-harming behavior: ""I'm bloodying myself up now.""
    The definition for **Behavior** states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide **or exhibits self-harming behavior**.""
    Since the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts AND exhibits self-harming behavior, it falls into the 'Behavior' category.
    It is not 'Attempt' because the primary focus is on current actions and future intent, and while past self-harm is mentioned, a specific past suicide attempt isn't detailed.
    It is not 'Ideation' because active self-harm is occurring.
    It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong expressions of being ""done"", deserving death, tiredness, anger (""stupidass ignorant people"").

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no mention of past attempts.
    *   This leaves **Ideation** vs. **Behavior**.
        *   **Ideation** definition: ""...explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
        *   **Behavior** definition: ""...explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method OR preparations taken...""

    The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""im fucking done"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me""). It also mentions a specific method (""blow my head off""). The definition of Behavior states that the plan ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method"". The mention of ""blow my head off"" qualifies as a specific method. Even though it's phrased as a request (""someone blow my head off"", ""please kill me""), the specificity of the method desired for death aligns with the ""Behavior"" category's requirement for mentioning a specific method as part of the suicidal expression. The desire is not just to die, but to die in a specific way. The ""plan"" here is the desired scenario of death which includes a specific method. The definition of Ideation specifies ""without any specific plan how to do so."" Since a specific method (""how to do so"") is mentioned, it moves beyond Ideation.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""very anxious"", ""struggle"", ""only option"", ""wouldn't be a problem"". The post expresses a sense of hopelessness about the future and sees suicide as a solution.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., pills, rope, location) are mentioned. No preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are described.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it all"" (mentioned as failing twice in the last 4 days), ""I want to die"", ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""failure"" (repeatedly), ""can't stand the person looking back at me"", ""afraid"", ""shut myself out"", ""hate myself"", ""despise myself"", ""scared"", ""content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again"". Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"". This is a specific method used in a past event.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""end it all"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, and the action described (overdose) confirms suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""I want to die"".

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - The post describes the execution of a past plan (taking pills).

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - It primarily refers to very recent past events (""failed twice in the last 4 days"", ""Yesterday I took...""). It also expresses current ideation (""I want to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - Yes, very clearly: ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and the specific description of taking ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" ""Yesterday"".

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly describes past actions taken to end life: ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"". This fits the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The post details a concrete action (overdose) that happened in the past. The rule ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" also applies here, as there is current ideation (""I want to die"") alongside clear descriptions of past attempts.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""looking into my options to end it all"", ""getting my ducks in a row"". These indicate active planning and preparation, though a specific method is not yet stated.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""commit lifen't"", ""end it all"" in the context of suicide).
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""end it all"", ""kill myself"", ""commit lifen't"", ""die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are explicitly named.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post explicitly states ""I'm looking into my options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"". These phrases indicate active research and preparatory actions being taken.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The post mentions active planning and preparation (""looking into my options"", ""getting my ducks in a row""). This is more than just ideation; it's the process of forming a plan and preparing.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and future intentions (""I'm looking into my options"", ""getting my ducks in a row"", ""once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision"", ""If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as explicit suicidal thoughts ""without any specific plan"".
    *   'Behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".
    *   The phrases ""looking into my options to end it all"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"" are explicit statements of ongoing planning and preparation. ""Looking into options"" is the act of researching or considering methods (planning). ""Getting my ducks in a row"" is a clear idiom for making preparations. These are active steps being taken towards suicide, even if the final method isn't disclosed in the post. This constitutes ""explicit planning"" and ""preparations taken"". Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Gonna end myself soon"", ""OD on"" (overdose).
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied severe distress, explicit intent to die.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on"". This specifies a method (overdose) and the means (specific drugs and quantities). ""Have"" indicates possession/preparation.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Gonna end myself soon"" is a direct statement of intent to commit suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Gonna end myself soon"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""OD on"" (overdose) with ""1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"". These are specific substances and quantities, constituting a clear method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"" implies the means have been acquired.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Gonna end myself soon"" clearly refers to current/future intentions.

    The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal intent (""Gonna end myself soon""). It also includes a specific plan and method (""OD on 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"") and implies preparation (having the substances). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It's not 'Ideation' because a specific plan and method are mentioned.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because it refers to a future action, not a past one.

All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me.

        *   Past: ""knife"" was mentioned in the context of past actions.
        *   Current: No specific *current* method, tools, locations, or substances for a *current* plan are detailed. ""I feel like I just need to do it"" is an expression of intent/ideation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No current preparations mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning (for a current act), choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. For the current state, it leans towards 'ideation' rather than 'behavior' as a specific current plan is absent.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This is a description of concrete past actions that are suicidal in nature, even if not completed.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to die/current suicidal intent (""I feel like I just need to do it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post describes past actions: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life."" The definition of 'Attempt' is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" Holding a knife to one's wrist is a concrete action, more than ""merely thought.""
    *   The 'Attempt' definition also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The post contains strong current suicidal ideation/intent (""I feel like I just need to do it""), which can be considered as ""current plans"" in a broader sense for this rule, or at least significant current suicidal preoccupation.
    *   While there isn't a *specific current plan* detailed enough for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""I'm going to use X method tonight""), the mention of past concrete actions (""knife to my wrist 3x"") combined with current suicidal intent (""I feel like I just need to do it"") makes 'Attempt' the most fitting category according to its definition, especially the note regarding co-occurrence of past attempts and current plans/ideation. The past action is a key differentiator.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide.

The suicidal thoughts described (""what if I wasn't in this world,"" ""on the verge on becoming suicidal"") are explicitly stated as occurring in the past (""During lockdown... At some point my thoughts came to...""). The current sentiment of the post is reflective and advisory.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The post describes past suicidal *ideation*, not a past *attempt* involving a concrete action. The definition of 'attempt' clarifies that ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   The post does not mention any specific plan or method for suicide, either past or present. The author even states they ""Never really thought I would act it out"" regarding their past thoughts. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   The post describes past suicidal thoughts (""what if I wasn't in this world,"" ""on the verge of becoming suicidal"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end myself again tonight"", ""try and end it tonight again"", ""overdose"". These are direct mentions of suicide and a method.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""really depressed and sad atm"", ""crying basically all night and now this morning"". These indicate significant distress.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Probably by trying to overdose"". This is a specific method. The timing ""tonight"" indicates a plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""end myself *again* tonight"", ""try and end it tonight *again*"". The word ""again"" clearly indicates a past attempt.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The intent to act ""tonight"" with a specified method suggests a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""again tonight"" implies a past attempt and a current/future intention to repeat it.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The word ""again"" implies a past attempt, though the details of the past attempt are not given, its occurrence is stated.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains:
    *   Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""end myself"").
    *   A specific plan/method for the current intention (""overdose"", ""tonight""). This would point towards 'Behavior'.
    *   A clear reference to past attempts (""again""). This would point towards 'Attempt'.

    The definition for 'Attempt' includes a crucial rule: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    This post explicitly states ""end myself *again* tonight"" and ""try and end it tonight *again*"", which refers to past attempts.
    It also mentions current plans: ""tonight"" and ""Probably by trying to overdose"".
    Since the post refers to past attempts AND mentions current plans, according to the provided rule, it should be classified as 'Attempt'.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. A general timeframe (""in the next month or two"") is given, but this is not a specific plan of action. No preparations like writing notes (other than this post itself, which could be seen as a farewell) or acquiring means are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"")? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""My time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" and particularly ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all"" express a clear desire for death as an escape from suffering. This is a desire to not be alive any longer.
    *   The 'Indicator' definition states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'."" and ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Suicide (the act) is not explicitly mentioned. However, the 'Ideation' definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."" The phrase ""My death will release my pain"" is a strong and explicit expression of a desire for death to occur, which fits ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" The 'Indicator' definition also says it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post *does* contain an indication of suicidal thoughts/feelings through the desire for death. Given the ""i.e."" clause in 'Ideation', a desire to not be alive is considered an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations are mentioned.
    *   Since no explicit plan or method is identified, it would not be 'Behavior'.

    The post expresses significant hopelessness and a clear desire for death (""My death will release my pain""). This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the desire for death as an escape is explicit.
    It is not 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and has ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post contains a direct indication of suicidal feelings through the expressed desire for death. The statement ""My death will release my pain"" goes beyond ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" or a ""vague feeling about dying"".
    It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.
    It is not 'Attempt' because there is no description of a past attempt.
    The crucial point is that ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" is explicitly stated as part of the 'Ideation' definition. The post clearly conveys this desire.

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain . I'm so scared I've never done anything like this before and I'm so scared of the pain I will cause to my parents and family . Thank you for listening and I hope I can get the peace i need .",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it"", ""I'm ready to do it"", ""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills"", ""suicide is on my mind"". The phrase ""do it"" clearly refers to suicide in this context.

These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills"". This is a specific plan involving a location (bathroom) and methods (knife, pills). The post also states ""I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom"", indicating preparation and imminence.
    *   References to past attempts: ""I've never done anything like this before"", indicating no past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide is on my mind"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to do it"" and the detailed plan to ""do it"" (commit suicide).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a knife and some pills"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""about to lock myself in the bathroom"". The timing (""currently 6 in the morning... I'm about to..."") also suggests active preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and imminent future intentions: ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it"", ""I'm ready to do it"", ""I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, the post explicitly states, ""I've never done anything like this before"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicide is on my mind"", ""I'm ready to do it""). Crucially, it also includes a specific plan: a method (""a knife and some pills"") and a location (""bathroom""), along with stated preparation (""about to lock myself in the bathroom""). This aligns directly with the definition of 'Behavior', which requires explicit suicidal thoughts and a plan/method/preparation. It is not 'Ideation' because a specific plan and means are mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' because it refers to current/imminent intentions, not a past action. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned along with a plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"", ""contemplate method"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""no interest in modern life"", ""depression"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" indicates thinking about methods, but no specific method is named.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post says ""contemplate method,"" which means the person is thinking about methods, but it does not specify *what* method(s).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific method is mentioned, only the act of contemplating them, this leans towards 'ideation'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current (""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"", ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no description of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""contemplate method"". The definition of 'Ideation' is ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The definition of 'Behavior' is ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""
    *   While ""contemplate method"" is a strong indication of progressing ideation, the post does not specify *a* method. It refers to the act of thinking about methods in general. According to the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and since no *specific* method is named, 'Ideation' is the more appropriate category. The person is thinking about methods but hasn't articulated a specific one in the post.

353,"Please help, I'm at my rope's end. Basically,. I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains the explicit statement ""I jsut want to die."" The phrase ""at my rope's end"" is an idiom for extreme distress.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with strong emotional indicators of distress, including feeling ""sexually vulnerable,"" ""triggered,"" ""hate,"" ""trapped,"" ""helplessness,"" trauma from past events (meningitis, family treatment, financial struggles, social isolation at school). There are expressions of hopelessness and being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) for suicide are mentioned. ""Rope's end"" is an idiom, not a stated method in this context.
    *   **Check for references to past attempts:** No references to past suicide attempts are made. The post mentions surviving meningitis and other traumatic life events, but not a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No):** No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No):** Yes, ""I jsut want to die.""
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** The expression ""I jsut want to die"" is a clear and direct expression of wanting to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances):** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means):** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** No explicit planning is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The statement ""I jsut want to die"" refers to current feelings/intentions. The surrounding text describes past and ongoing traumatic experiences leading to this feeling.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains a direct and explicit expression of wanting to die (""I jsut want to die""). This aligns with the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    It is not **Indicator** because Indicator states ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" ""I jsut want to die"" is a direct indication of suicidal thoughts/feelings and an explicit desire to not be alive. While ""suicide"" itself isn't mentioned, the Ideation definition clarifies that ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" counts. The rule in Indicator ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" is considered, but ""I jsut want to die"" is a very clear expression of a desire to not be alive, fitting the Ideation criteria.
    It is not **Behavior** because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.
    It is not **Attempt** because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
    The presence of ""I jsut want to die"" moves it beyond general distress (Indicator) into explicit suicidal ideation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" (method of potential suicide/severe self-harm), ""suicide hotline"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""don't know what to do,"" ""fuck up,"" ""can never get anything right,"" ""mom thinks I'm a genuinely stupid human being,"" feeling of being trapped (""don't want to be locked up""). These indicate distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a specific method. The person states they are ""sitting in my car right now thinking of"" doing this, which implies the means (car) is available and the thought is active and current.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a direct expression of contemplating a suicidal act.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The person is ""sitting in my car right now thinking of"" it. This indicates the means (car) is immediately available and the thought is current and specific. This can be considered a form of preparation or immediate contemplation of a plan.

    *   The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"").
    *   Crucially, it also mentions a specific method: ""driving 100 mph into a tree.""

It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
    *   ""Driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a specific method. The person is currently in their car contemplating this. This fits the criteria for 'Behavior' because a specific method is mentioned alongside the suicidal thought.
    *   It is not an 'Attempt' as it describes current thoughts, not a past action.

        *   ""I've struggled with suicide before."" (explicit mention of suicide regarding the poster)
        *   ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" (implies a past attempt or severe crisis)

        *   ""im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing"" (implies intention of dying)
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):
        *   ""I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much."" (strong self-loathing)
        *   ""Im so regretful and sorry""

        *   ""I dont see any future ahead for me."" (hopelessness)

    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   No specific method, tool, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned for the current ideation. ""Joining her"" is vague.
    *   Check for references to past attempts:
        *   ""I've struggled with suicide before.""
        *   ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" (This strongly indicates a past attempt that required medical intervention).

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I've struggled with suicide before"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""once my mum passes I will be joining her as well,"" ""my passing"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""Joining her"" is not a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The current suicidal expressions do not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there's no specific plan/method.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both.
        *   Past: ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" (This refers to a past attempt/crisis).
        *   Current/Future: ""I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. ... im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing."" (These are current suicidal ideations and intentions for the future).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? ""I was hospitalised for it previously"" strongly implies a concrete past action (attempt) that was serious enough for hospitalization.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post clearly mentions a past struggle with suicide leading to hospitalization: ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" This fits the description of a past attempt, as hospitalization implies a concrete action rather than just thoughts.
    *   The post also contains current suicidal ideation and intent: ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well"" and ""im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing.""
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   The phrase ""hospitalised for it previously"" indicates a past attempt.
    *   The expressions of wanting to die after the mother passes and sorrow for ""my passing"" constitute ""current plans"" in the sense of current suicidal intentions, even if not detailed methods for the 'Behavior' category.
    *   Given the explicit rule, since the post refers to a past attempt (hospitalization) and also mentions current suicidal intentions/plans (to ""join"" his mother, ""my passing""), the category is 'Attempt'.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post includes ""wake up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" While not using words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" these phrases are significant.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post is replete with strong emotional indicators such as ""My mind is hell,"" ""mental battle that I am losing,"" ""painful,"" ""nothing changes,"" ""worse thoughts each time,"" ""tear me down every night,"" ""feel so stupid,"" ""feel so weak, so hopeless against my head.""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. ""wake up even more tired of living"" is an explicit expression of a feeling that equates to a desire to not be alive any longer. The statement ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it,"" in the context of extreme hopelessness and being ""tired of living,"" strongly implies an intention to end the current state of suffering/living. This qualifies as an expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While ""suicide"" isn't named, the desire to not be alive (""tired of living"") and the thought of stopping ""it"" (the unbearable state of existence) are expressed clearly enough to be considered explicit expressions of suicidal feelings/thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is mentioned, this leans away from 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: The post describes current distress and implies future intentions (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses profound hopelessness and distress. The phrase ""wake up even more tired of living"" is an explicit expression of a feeling directly related to a desire to not be alive, fitting the Ideation definition (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer""). The subsequent statement, ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it,"" reinforces this as a suicidal thought—an intention to end the unbearable state.
    No specific plan or method is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    There is no mention of past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    While the post shows ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness,"" and ""suicide/killing oneself"" is not explicitly named (which is a point for 'Indicator'), the Ideation definition's criterion of ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" seems met by ""tired of living"" and the intent to ""stop it."" The phrase ""tired of living"" is more than a vague feeling; it's a direct statement about the experience of life itself. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category.

    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""constantly contemplate suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes (""Would've been better for me to not be here at all""). The phrase ""I don't want to anymore"" also strongly implies this in context.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan identified.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and contemplation (""constantly contemplate"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""constantly contemplate suicide"") and expresses a clear desire not to be alive (""Would've been better for me to not be here at all""). This meets the criteria for 'Ideation' as it shows explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but lacks any specific plan or method. It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It's not 'Behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned. It's not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

To say hey jesus or whatever I had an impossible situation can I go back?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    -   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide is better"", ""release is better"", ""can I go back?"" (implying ending life).
    -   Emotional indicators: ""trauma, ocd, anhedonia, no friends, abuse"", ""life is a bust"", ""impossible situation"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    -   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    -   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    -   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide is better"").
    -   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""suicide is better"", ""release is better"", ""can I go back?"").
    -   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    -   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    -   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    -   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan is mentioned, so this supports 'Ideation'.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    -   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and contemplation about the future (""When to know if suicide is better"").
    -   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and contemplates whether it is ""better."" It also refers to ""release"" in the context of life being a ""bust."" These are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'Behavior' because no plan is mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wanna go sleep forever"" is a strong euphemism for wanting to die or commit suicide. The post also mentions specific medications and quantities: ""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg,"" implying a method of overdose.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""can't take this shit no more,"" ""I'm sick and tired of my shitty life"" indicate hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, the specific medications (Seroquel, Viepax) and their quantities are listed. The phrase ""I have..."" indicates possession or access, which is a form of preparation. The implied method is overdose.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wanna go sleep forever"" is a clear expression of wanting to die, especially in conjunction with the mention of lethal means.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The expression ""wanna go sleep forever"" coupled with the medication list is a fairly clear expression of wanting to die, moving beyond 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the post lists specific medications (""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg""), which implies overdose as the method. These are specific drugs and quantities.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, stating ""I have..."" these medications indicates that the means are acquired or accessible, which is a sign of preparation.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The mention of specific drugs and quantities, linked to the desire to ""go sleep forever,"" constitutes an explicit plan. The level of detail (drug names, quantities) points towards a plan rather than just vague ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I wanna go sleep forever"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses a clear desire to die (""wanna go sleep forever""). This meets the criteria for at least 'Ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"").
    Crucially, the post also includes ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs...)"" which is part of the 'Behavior' definition. The listing of ""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"" and stating ""I have"" them, combined with ""wanna go sleep forever,"" clearly indicates a plan involving a specific method (overdose with specific drugs) and preparation (having the drugs).
    It is not 'Indicator' because the desire to die is explicit.
    It is not 'Ideation' because a specific plan and means are mentioned.
    It is not 'Attempt' because it refers to current/future intent, not a past action.
    Therefore, the category 'Behavior' is the most appropriate.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die"", ""I'm tired of being alive"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""depressed"", ""miserable"", ""stuck"", ""loveless marriage"", ""He says mean things to me"", ""no motivation to get better"", ""kids are growing to resent me"", ""It's not fair to people to have to deal with me"", ""It hurts"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes: ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive"".
    *   The 'Indicator' definition states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'."" It also says, ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" However, the 'Ideation' definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."" The phrases ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive"" are direct and explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive. The 'Indicator' definition also states: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" A desire to die *is* expressed here. Given that ""I want to die"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive, this aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan or method is mentioned, it is not 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The statements ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive"" refer to current feelings and intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    It does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparations, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the expressions ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive"" are explicit desires to not be alive, moving beyond general distress (which would be 'Indicator'). The 'Indicator' definition states ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" A desire to die is clearly expressed. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times."" (implies suicide attempts)
        *   ""I don't want to bail out anymore."" (implies wanting to succeed in ending life)
        *   ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" (specific self-harm/suicide attempt method)
        *   ""I have a rope."" (means for suicide)

        *   ""I can't do it."" (struggle, despair)
        *   ""I don't want to traumatize anyone."" (consideration for others, but also part of the suicidal thought process)
        *   ""I hate myself so much."" (strong negative self-perception)
        *   ""I am scared."" (fear, ambivalence)
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Past method: ""knife""

        *   Potential location/method: ""There's a building""
    *   Check for references to past attempts:
        *   ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times.""
        *   ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used directly.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I don't want to bail out anymore"" (in context of previous attempts), ""I have to do it"", ""I want this to end."" These strongly imply a desire to die.
    *   Given the strong context of past attempts and current means, the expressions are clearly about ending life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. Past: ""knife"". Current: ""rope"" (means), ""building"" (potential method/location - jumping).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes: ""I have a rope."" Considering a location (""There's a building"").
    *   The mention of having a rope and considering a building constitutes a plan or, at the very least, significant preparation/consideration of method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both.
        *   Past events: ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times. I tried with a knife. It didn't work.""
        *   Current/future intentions: ""I don't want to bail out anymore."", ""I have a rope."", ""There's a building"", ""I have to do it.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes. ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This is a description of a concrete action in the past.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains several key elements:
    *   **Past Attempts:** ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times. I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This clearly describes past actions taken to end life.
    *   **Current Ideation:** ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end.""
    *   **Current Plan/Means:** ""I have a rope,"" ""There's a building.""

    According to the provided definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** Lacks explicit expression concerning suicide. This post has explicit expressions. Not 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation:** Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. This post includes mention of means (""rope"") and a potential location/method (""building""), and past attempts. Not just 'Ideation'.
    *   **Behavior:** Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND mentions a plan or exhibits self-harming behavior (method, preparations). This could fit the current elements (""I have a rope"", ""There's a building"", ""I have to do it"").
    *   **Attempt:** ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. ... A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). ... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""

    The post states, ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This is a concrete action (attempt) in the past.
    The post also mentions current plans/means (""I have a rope,"" ""There's a building,"" ""I have to do it."").
    The rule for 'Attempt' is: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    Since the post describes past attempts (""tried with a knife"") AND mentions current plans/means (""I have a rope"", ""building""), the category 'Attempt' is the most appropriate according to the provided rule.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to end it"" is a clear expression of wanting to end one's life.

These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""want to end it"" in this context is a direct and commonly understood expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just want to end it"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. In this context, ""want to end it"" is quite clear and not vague.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan is mentioned, it's not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and intentions (""i just want to end it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains strong expressions of hopelessness and worthlessness (""Tired of it,"" ""No point,"" ""useless""). Crucially, it includes the phrase ""i just want to end it,"" which is an explicit expression of a desire to die or end one's life. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide, which means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    There is no mention of past suicide attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""i just want to end it"" clearly fits ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" (implies wanting to die). ""attempt properly again"" (explicitly mentions a past attempt and a future intention to attempt).
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""depressed"", ""Tired of being alone"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method or preparation for the *future* attempt is mentioned, only a potential trigger (""Christmas probably won't be happening"").
    *   Check for references to past attempts: Yes, ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates at least one past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""attempt properly again"" refers to a suicidal act.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. This is quite clear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for a current or future attempt are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No current preparations are mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. For the future intention, there's no explicit plan, so it would lean towards ideation if considered in isolation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" is current ideation. ""attempt properly again"" refers to a past event (""again"" implies it happened before) and a future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Not in detail, but ""attempt properly again"" is a direct reference to a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow,"" which is an expression of current suicidal ideation.
    Crucially, the post also states, ""that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again."" The phrase ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates a past suicide attempt.
    The definition of **Attempt** states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    In this post, there is a reference to a past attempt (""attempt... again"") and current ideation (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"") as well as a future intention to attempt (""attempt properly again"" in the future). The current ideation and future intention qualify as ""current plans"" in the context of this rule when a past attempt is also mentioned.
    Therefore, the post falls into the 'Attempt' category due to the explicit mention of a past attempt (""again"") coupled with current suicidal ideation and future intention.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""chop me up"". The post explicitly requests someone to end the poster's life.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The request to be killed and for the body to be hidden and dismembered indicates extreme distress and a desire to cease existing without a trace.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The ""plan"" involves finding someone else to perform the act (""looking for someone to kill me""). The ""method"" is being killed by this person, and specific instructions for body disposal are given (""hide my body so that my family will never find out"", ""chop me up""). The post itself is a form of ""preparation"" or seeking means.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Not the word ""suicide,"" but the intent is clear.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""looking for someone to kill me"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' - It is clear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - Yes, the method is being killed by another person (""someone to kill me"") and subsequent dismemberment (""chop me up""). While the user isn't specifying the *exact* tool the other person would use to kill them, they are specifying the actions to be taken.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - The post itself is an act of seeking the means (finding a person to carry out the plan).
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' - The plan seems explicit: find someone, be killed by them, body hidden, body dismembered.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current/future intentions (""i am looking for someone to kill me"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""looking for someone to kill me"").
    It also outlines a specific plan for how this death should occur:
    1.  Find a person.
    2.  This person kills the poster.
    3.  The body is hidden.
    4.  The body is dismembered.
    This constitutes a plan with specific methods/actions requested. The act of posting to find someone to carry this out is a form of preparation or seeking means.
    The definition of 'Behavior' is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
    The desire to be killed is an explicit suicidal thought. The detailed request for how it should be done (""someone to kill me,"" ""hide my body,"" ""chop me up"") constitutes a plan and method.
    This goes beyond 'Ideation' which is ""without any specific plan"". Here, a specific sequence of events leading to death and disposal of the body is outlined.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death."" This goes beyond 'Indicator' which requires no explicit expression concerning suicide.
    *   The post fits 'Ideation' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts"", ""fantasizing about my death"", ""some days I consider it""). There is no specific plan or method mentioned, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The statement ""I have no desire to die"" is present, but it's part of the description of the struggle against the suicidal thoughts. The thoughts themselves are explicitly stated and recurrent, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""wish to end my life"", ""end all this"", ""can't harm myself"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""problems are getting worse"", ""struggling more and more"", ""emotionally neglected"", ""depressed"", ""unimportant"", ""sad"", ""envious"", ""don't have any more options"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post explicitly states, ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest.""
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""wish to end my life"" and ""end all this"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just really wish to end my life"" and ""I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this.""

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post explicitly states an inability to self-harm: ""The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest."" This indicates no plan or behavior.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions/desires.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""wish to end my life"", ""end all this""). This clearly goes beyond 'indicator'.
    However, there is no mention of any specific plan, method, or preparation. In fact, the writer states they ""can't harm myself"". This rules out 'behavior'.
    There is no mention of past attempts, ruling out 'attempt'.
    Therefore, the category is 'ideation' because there are explicit suicidal thoughts and desires but no plan.

367,I lost control. I've lost control of my head I just want to cry I can't breathe I want to scream help please I don't want to live this again,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I don't want to live this again"" is a strong statement indicating a desire not to continue living.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""lost control,"" ""lost control of my head,"" ""just want to cry,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""want to scream help please."" These indicate severe emotional distress, a feeling of being overwhelmed, and a plea for help.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""this again"" could imply a recurring state of distress or a past negative experience, but it does not explicitly describe a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to live this again"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. However, ""I don't want to live this again"" is a fairly direct expression of not wanting to be alive, which aligns with the definition of ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This step is relevant if we were considering 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""I don't want to live *this* again"" expresses a current desire related to an ongoing or recurring unbearable situation. The desire not to live is current.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. ""this again"" is too vague to classify as a described past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post shows significant distress.
    *   The statement ""I don't want to live this again"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive.
    *   The definition of **Indicator** states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide."" While ""suicide"" isn't mentioned, ""I don't want to live"" is more than a ""vague feeling about dying.""
    *   The definition of **Ideation** states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan... If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" The post *does* express a desire not to be alive.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, so it is not **Behavior**.
    *   There is no clear description of a past suicide attempt, so it is not **Attempt**.
    *   The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive, fitting the definition of **Ideation**. The emotional distress supports this, but the key is the expressed desire.

368,It's too hard. This is too hard I want to tell them everything not in writing but on the phone so they can hear the sincerity of my voice. My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship. I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it. And my mom didn't even tell my brother the whole truth. They can't keep hiding it and brushing it off.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""my reason to die"", ""I decided this is it"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""It's too hard"", ""fucking sickness god it's horrible"", ""tired"", ""pissed off"", ""family doesn't listen"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" Leaving a note is a preparation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""my reason to die"" and ""I decided this is it"" in this context strongly imply suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No specific method of suicide is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - Yes, ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" This is a clear sign of preparation.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - It refers to a current decision and preparation (""I decided this is it"", ""I left a note"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""my reason to die"", ""I decided this is it""). It also includes a sign of preparation: ""I left a note"". According to the definition of 'Behavior', it ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)."" The mention of leaving a note qualifies as a preparation. Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category. It is not 'Attempt' as it doesn't describe a past action. It's more than 'Ideation' because of the preparation (leaving a note).

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""screamed that I wanted to die"" (past ideation)
        *   ""it's never been far away from my mind since"" (ongoing ideation)
        *   ""fired for being suicidal"" (past state, implies ideation/behavior)
        *   ""I just. Want. To die."" (current, explicit desire)
        *   ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" (current, explicit, seeking method/plan)
    *   **Emotional indicators:**
        *   Extensive expressions of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing (""unstable freak,"" ""creep""), failure (""I blew it""), loneliness, feeling like a burden (""I don't want to be a burden anymore""), worthlessness (""I don't deserve anything""), and anhedonia (""Nothing can be bothered with anymore"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   The post asks ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"". This is a direct question seeking a method and shows consideration of the aftermath (a constraint on the method). It does not state a *chosen* method or specific preparations already made (like acquiring means or writing a note).
    *   **References to past attempts:**
        *   ""Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die"" - This is past ideation, not a described attempt.
        *   ""fired for being suicidal"" - Indicates a past suicidal state but doesn't detail an attempt. No concrete past action of an attempt is described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicidal"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I just. Want. To die."", ""How do I kill myself..."").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, rope, jumping) is mentioned as chosen or considered. The post is *asking for* a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned. The question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body..."" indicates a desire to plan and an active thought process about the logistics, but not a formed plan or completed preparation.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' requires the post to ""mention (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" or ""include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Asking for a method is a step towards planning but does not itself constitute a mentioned plan or specific method as exemplified in the definition (e.g., ""lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...""). The post does not *contain* specific ideas of how to commit suicide; it solicits them.
    *   Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and the fact that a specific plan or method is not *mentioned* but rather *sought*, this leans towards 'Ideation'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to past ideation (""Middle school... wanted to die"", ""fired for being suicidal"").
    *   The primary focus is on current and future intentions (""I just. Want. To die."", ""How do I kill myself..."").
    *   No past attempts are specifically described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly goes beyond 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned, and a desire to die is expressed.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is defined as explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
        *   'Behavior' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""
        *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I just. Want. To die."").
        *   The question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" shows a strong desire to find a method and considers an aspect of planning (minimizing impact on parents). However, it does not *mention* a specific method, a formulated plan, or preparations already taken. It is an inquiry *about* how to form such a plan.
        *   The definition of 'Ideation' also states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" This post does not *contain* such ideas; it is *asking for* them.
        *   Therefore, while the user is actively seeking a plan, the post itself does not *mention* a plan or specific method as per the 'Behavior' definition's examples. Applying the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" the classification is 'Ideation'. The user is expressing strong suicidal ideation and is in the process of trying to formulate a plan, but has not yet stated one.

I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy.

One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""push me over the edge"": Suggests a breaking point, potentially leading to self-harm or suicide.
        *   ""wasn't meant for this world"": Implies a desire to not exist.
        *   ""what the point of moving on is"": Questions the value of life.
        *   ""I'll be free from it all"": Suggests death as a release.
        *   ""faced with the eternal void"": Refers to death.
        *   ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"": Strongly implies considering an unnatural, self-inflicted end to life.
    *   Emotional indicators:
        *   ""No point in it all"": Hopelessness, despair.
        *   ""I hate being trapped in limbo"": Distress.
        *   ""won't get anywhere in life"": Hopelessness.
        *   ""My view of the world is growing more and more dim"": Worsening depression/hopelessness.
        *   ""don't really see a future for myself"": Hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   ""One last push is all I need"": This is vague and refers to a trigger or decision point, not a specific method, tool, location, or preparation.
    *   References to past attempts:
        *   None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., the word ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"")? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""wasn't meant for this world,"" ""I'll be free from it all,"" ""faced with the eternal void,"" and particularly ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" strongly express a desire to not be alive and to end life prematurely.
    *   The 'Ideation' definition clarifies that ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" counts as an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The post clearly conveys this desire.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""One last push"" is not a specific method, tool, location, or substance.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there is no explicit plan, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and future intentions (""One last push is all I need and I'll be free"", ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** The post goes beyond ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" or a ""vague feeling about dying."" The phrase ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" is a direct indication of suicidal thoughts, not just hopelessness. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the desire to end life is strongly implied.
    *   **Ideation:** The definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post. The phrases ""I'll be free from it all,"" ""faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive any longer and to end one's life. There is no specific plan mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** No specific plan or method is mentioned. ""One last push"" is too vague.
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempts are described.

    The post expresses a clear and strong desire to die and to not wait for natural death, which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer""). The absence of a specific plan or method means it is not 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned. The phrase ""get to that place"" refers to the state leading to suicide. ""snap and break down"" refers to a severe mental state.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""bottled everything up,"" ""painful emotions,"" ""snap and break down."" These indicate distress. However, the post frames these as experiences of ""People who commit suicide"" generally, rather than a direct statement of the poster's current personal state.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive *from the poster about themselves*? No. The post is a general statement about ""People who commit suicide"" and an explanation of why ""we"" (referring to this group) might reach that point. It's not a direct statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I am suicidal."" The rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"" is key here. The post is an observation or opinion about others, or a general group.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Not applicable as no personal ideation is clearly expressed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions *of the poster*? The post is a general statement about a process, not about the poster's specific past, current, or future suicidal intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post mentions ""suicide"" but does so in a general, explanatory context about ""people who commit suicide.""
    *   It does not contain an explicit expression of the *poster's own* suicidal thoughts, feelings, or desire to die. The use of ""we"" (""we've bottled everything up,"" ""we just snap"") appears to be an empathetic or generalized ""we"" referring to the group being discussed (""people who commit suicide""), rather than a direct personal admission of the poster's current suicidal state.
    *   The definition of **Indicator** states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide [by the poster about themselves]... no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings [by the poster about themselves]."" It also notes: ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit [as the poster's own ideation/intent] in order to not be 'indicator'.""
    *   The definition of **Ideation** requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" from the poster. This post does not meet that criterion for the poster themselves.
    *   Given that the post is a general commentary on suicide and the reasons behind it, rather than a personal expression of suicidal ideation from the writer, it falls into the 'Indicator' category. The focus is on explaining a phenomenon in others, not on the writer's own suicidal state.

    The post explicitly mentions suicide (""If I kill myself"") and expresses a desire to die (""leave this world forever""). However, it does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. It does not describe a past attempt.
    - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    - It fits 'Ideation' because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because it doesn't describe a past attempt.
    Therefore, the category is 'Ideation'.

He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""so tired of having to live"" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" These are significant. No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"" as actions.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post is replete with emotional indicators such as ""so tired of having to live,"" ""extremely frustrated,"" ""demoralising,"" ""constant feeling of dread and anxiety,"" ""I feel nothing anymore,"" ""constant state of anxiety and/or depression,"" ""can't fucking function."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"" is a direct expression of expecting to be dead, which in this context implies a suicidal thought or giving up on life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan or method is mentioned, it would not be 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings of despair and anxiety (""I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety,"" ""I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression"") and future intentions/expectations (""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains strong expressions of distress, hopelessness, and a lack of will to live.
    *   Key phrases are ""so tired of having to live"" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead.""
    *   The definition of **Indicator** states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide."" It also notes, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    *   The definition of **Ideation** states it ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan."" It also states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
    *   ""So tired of having to live"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive any longer.
    *   ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"" is an explicit expression of a suicidal thought (expecting to be dead, given the overwhelming despair).
    *   These expressions go beyond ""vague feeling about dying or death"" or ""general dissatisfaction."" They directly address the poster's desire not to live and their expectation of being dead.
    *   While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the criteria for 'Ideation' include ""a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which is clearly present.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' category due to the explicit expressions of wanting to not be alive and thoughts of being dead, without a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill their self"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""end their pain"" suggests distress. The phrase ""Asking for a personal reason"" strongly implies the poster is relating the question to their own situation and feelings.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill their self"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The question ""If someone wants to kill their self... why do people stop them?"" combined with ""(Asking for a personal reason)"" strongly suggests the poster is contemplating suicide or experiencing suicidal thoughts. While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the personal context makes it an expression of suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrasing suggests current contemplation or ideation due to ""Asking for a personal reason.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions ""kill their self."" The phrase ""Asking for a personal reason"" links this contemplation of suicide directly to the poster, indicating they are having suicidal thoughts. There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or past attempt.
    - It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and the ""personal reason"" implies suicidal thoughts from the poster.
    - It fits 'ideation' because it expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill their self"" for a ""personal reason"") without a specific plan.
    - It is not 'behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned.
    - It is not 'attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    The crucial part is ""Asking for a personal reason,"" which transforms a general question about suicide into an expression of the poster's own suicidal thoughts.

So some how she convince me not to."" This describes a past suicidal ideation with a potential method, but the action was prevented before it occurred.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"", asking about the lethality of the method).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past suicidal ideation (""when I was 10 or 11... I thought jumping in and drowning"") and current/future intentions (""Now I'm 16... suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The post describes a past *thought* of an attempt (""I thought jumping in and drowning"") where the person was convinced not to act. According to the definition of 'Attempt', ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past... When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" Therefore, this past event is not classified as an 'attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   The past event (""thought jumping in and drowning"") does not qualify as an 'Attempt' because no concrete action happened; it was a thought and the person was convinced not to proceed.
    *   The current part of the post (""Now I'm 16... suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"") expresses suicidal thoughts and includes a specific plan (method: train, neck on tracks; timing: 18th birthday).
    *   This fits the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations (e.g. ... train lines to get run over by).""
    *   The rule ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" is not applicable here because the past event described is not an 'attempt' by the provided definition.
    *   Therefore, the classification is based on the current explicit suicidal thoughts with a specific plan and method.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""end his life"", ""tried to end his life"", ""thinking about it"" (referring to suicide), ""ok to try"" (referring to suicide).
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""rougher weeks lately"", ""can´t really explain why I feel like this"", ""don´t want to think like this anymore"". The post indicates distress and rumination on suicide.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for the person writing the post. The post mentions someone else's attempt, but no plan for the author.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The post says ""I´ve had some suicidal thoughts through my life, but most of them are behind me."" This refers to past *thoughts*, not past *attempts*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts"", ""end his life"", ""tried to end his life"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The phrase ""It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try"" implies a current consideration of suicide as an option, which is a form of expressing a desire to not be alive or to end one's life. The statement ""I keep thinking about it"" (suicide) also points to this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the poster.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan is mentioned, this points away from 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post mentions past ""suicidal thoughts"" but focuses on current thoughts: ""Since then I keep thinking about it,"" and ""It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try."" The distress and thoughts are current.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The post mentions past *suicidal thoughts*, not past *attempts* by the author. The definition of 'attempt' requires a concrete action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there are expressions of suicidal thoughts. The definition of 'indicator' states it ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide.""
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I keep thinking about it [suicide],"" ""opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try""). There is no specific plan or method mentioned for the poster. This aligns with the definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   **Behavior:** This is not 'behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations taken by the poster.
    *   **Attempt:** This is not 'attempt' because the post describes past *suicidal thoughts* of the author, not a past *attempt* (concrete action). The trigger is someone else's attempt.

The post clearly expresses current suicidal thoughts triggered by an external event, without detailing a plan. Therefore, it falls into 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""just want my life to end"" is a clear expression related to dying or wanting life to cease.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post mentions ""intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes,"" indicating significant distress and likely hopelessness leading to the statement ""just want my life to end.""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""just want my life to end"" is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The 'Ideation' definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."". The phrase ""just want my life to end"" directly fits ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" The 'Indicator' definition says ""no explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""vague feeling about dying or death"". ""Just want my life to end"" is not vague; it's a direct expression of a desire for life to end. The ""i.e."" in the Ideation definition clarifies that ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" is considered an explicit expression of suicidal feelings for this classification.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': This rule applies, as there is no explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: The language ""just want my life to end"" and the description of ongoing struggles (""CONSTANTLY"") suggest current feelings and intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post clearly expresses a desire for life to end (""just want my life to end""), which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer""). It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'. It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the desire to die is explicit. The 'Ideation' definition's inclusion of ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" as an example of explicit expression means this post fits 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""nearly killing myself one night"", ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""disconnected from life"", ""emotions never act how i want"", ""don't feel really anything"", ""everything seems so far out of my touch"", ""constant bad moods"". Feelings of dissociation, depersonalization, hopelessness, lack of control.
    *   Specific plans/methods: ""step off a building or over a bridge"". These are specific methods/locations.
    *   Past attempts: ""nearly killing myself one night"". This suggests a past event that was close to being a fatal attempt, or a serious attempt.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""nearly killing myself one night"" and the ideation about stepping off a building/bridge.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the contemplation of ""step off a building or over a bridge"" implies a desire to end life to gain control.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""step off a building or over a bridge"". These are specific methods and locations.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly mentioned as current preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means), but the mention of specific methods points towards a plan, even if hypothetical or future-oriented.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""nearly killing myself one night"" is a past event. ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" refers to a potential future action/plan.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? ""nearly killing myself one night"" is a description of a past event that sounds like an attempt or very close to one.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post mentions ""nearly killing myself one night"", which points to a past attempt.
    *   It also mentions current suicidal ideation with specific methods/locations: ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking.""
    *   The rule states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   The phrase ""nearly killing myself one night"" strongly suggests a past action. Even if it wasn't a ""completed"" attempt in the sense of requiring medical intervention (though it might have), it was a concrete action taken in the past with the intent of self-harm/suicide.
    *   The current ideation includes specific methods (""step off a building or over a bridge""), which would qualify as 'behavior' if the past attempt wasn't present.
    *   Given the presence of a past event described as ""nearly killing myself"" and current plans, the 'Attempt' category seems most appropriate according to the rule. The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" implies a concrete action was taken.

Let's re-evaluate ""nearly killing myself one night"". This sounds like a past action was taken. The definition of 'Attempt' is ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'. Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""

""Nearly killing myself"" implies a concrete action was taken that brought the person close to death. This fits the ""concrete action need to have happened in the past"" part of the 'Attempt' definition.
The post also contains current plans (""step off a building or over a bridge"").
Therefore, according to the rule ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"", this post should be classified as 'Attempt'.
The current ideation with a plan (""step off a building or over a bridge"") would be 'Behavior' on its own.
The past event (""nearly killing myself one night"") is an 'Attempt'.
Since both are present, and the rule prioritizes 'Attempt' in this scenario, 'Attempt' is the correct classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""too much happening and i don't want to deal with it,"" ""disappoint and burden other people,"" ""scared it'll be painful."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feeling like a burden.

    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""take myself out,"" ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""need it to stop""). This goes beyond 'indicator'. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, tools, or location for suicide. The user mentions being ""scared it'll be painful"" but doesn't specify *how* they are contemplating this. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). It is not 'Behavior' because no plan is mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' as it refers to current feelings, not a past action.

    *   It does not mention suicide explicitly by name, but ""want to die"" is a very strong indicator of suicidal thoughts. The 'Ideation' definition states ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   There is no mention of a plan or method, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""contemplating"", ""thinking on how to die painlessly"", ""when I'm gone"", ""I want to die"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""killed my mental health"", ""useless person alive"", ""failure"", ""disappointment"", ""coward"", ""so tired of expectations"", ""scared of the consequences of failure"". Strong feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way"". This indicates thinking about methods but no specific method or plan is stated. No preparations mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, phrases like ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" and ""I want to die"" are direct references to ending one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""I want to die"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No. The post states ""thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way."" This is thinking *about* finding a method, not stating a method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The user is actively thinking about *how* to die but has not identified a specific plan or method. This leans towards ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: ""for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly"", ""I want to die"". This refers to ongoing thoughts and current intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"") and thinking about methods (""thinking on how to die painlessly""). This clearly moves beyond 'indicator'.
    *   It fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The user expresses a desire to die and has been thinking about how, but no specific plan or method is mentioned.
    *   It does not fit 'behavior' because no specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
    *   It does not fit 'attempt' as there is no mention of a past attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""Must end this shit show.""
        *   ""So many people commit suicide. Why must I be so afraid?""
        *   ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" (""do it"" implies suicide in this context)
        *   ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):
        *   Extensive expressions of hate (""hate my parents,"" ""hate the doctor,"" ""hate bad memories,"" ""hate every single day,"" ""literally hate everything,"" ""I fucking hate"").
        *   Feelings of being judged, misunderstood (""judge me and label me mentally ill"").

        *   Overwhelm (""I'm very OVER this shit"").
        *   Despair (""My life is ruined,"" ""I have nothing"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This is a preparation, akin to writing a suicide note. The act of ""doing it"" is implied to be suicide. No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon) for ""doing it"" is mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts:
        *   ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop."" This refers to thoughts, not actions/attempts. No past attempts are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""commit suicide,"" ""killing myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Must end this shit show"" and the implication of ""before I do it"" (referring to ending life). ""Thought about killing myself"" also confirms this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (tools, locations, substances) for the act of suicide is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This is a clear preparatory step. Sending final messages is a recognized preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily describes current distress and future intentions/preparations (""Must end this shit show,"" ""emails to send ... before I do it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Only past ideation is mentioned (""thought about killing myself for 5 years"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and suicidal thoughts are expressed.
    *   It clearly contains 'ideation' (""thought about killing myself for 5 years"").
    *   The critical point is whether it meets the criteria for 'behavior'. The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...).""
    *   The phrase ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it"" constitutes a ""preparation taken."" Sending emails before the act is analogous to writing a suicide note. The intent to ""do it"" (commit suicide) is linked to this preparation. While a specific method for ""it"" is not detailed, the preparation itself is explicit.
    *   It is not 'attempt' as no past action of attempting suicide is described.

    The presence of a stated preparation (""emails to send"") directly linked to the intended act (""before I do it"") elevates this from 'ideation' to 'behavior' according to the provided definitions.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Ending it soon"" directly implies suicide. ""taking it all"" refers to taking a lethal dose of dextromethorphan.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""so fucking depressed"", ""scared"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here"". This is a specific substance (dextromethorphan), a quantity (14 grams), and a preparation (ordered it, waiting for arrival to take it).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): ""Ending it soon"" is a very strong and direct implication of suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""Ending it soon"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is quite clear.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): Yes, ""14 grams of dextromethorphan"" (a substance) and the method is ""taking it all"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): Yes, ""ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail"". This is acquiring the means.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The planning is explicit.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current/future intentions (""Ending it soon"", ""I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end life (""Ending it soon""). It also includes a specific plan: using ""14 grams of dextromethorphan"" which has been ""ordered"" (preparation/acquiring means) and the intent to take ""it all as soon as it gets here"" (method). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit suicidal thoughts and a plan/method/preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""Human tend to die around 80."" No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm by the author regarding themselves.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses strong dissatisfaction with life (""it wasn't really good""), questions the value and desire to live (""how people can want to live?"", ""how they actually find important to stay alive?""), and views the prospect of a long life as a burden (""60 fucking years left,"" ""you guys are telling me I have to live 60 years more,"" ""When did Human thought it would be cool living so much?""). This indicates significant hopelessness and a profound lack of desire for continued life as perceived by the author.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly but strongly. The author's questioning of why anyone would want to live, coupled with their personal negative experience (""it wasn't really good"") and the dread of many more years (""I have 60 fucking years left ... I have to live 60 years more""), strongly implies a personal lack of desire to continue living this perceived life. This constitutes an expression of not wanting to be alive, fitting the ""vague thoughts about not wanting to live"" aspect of ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan or method is identified, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and despair about the future, based on past negative experiences.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant personal distress, hopelessness, and a profound questioning of the value of life, specifically the author's own long future. Phrases like ""how people can want to live?"", ""it wasn't really good"" (referring to their own lived experience), and ""I have 60 fucking years left ... so you guys are telling me I have to live 60 years more?"" indicate a strong lack of desire for their continued existence as they perceive it.
    This aligns with the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... This can range from vague thoughts about not wanting to live to stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life (albeit without a specific plan how to do so)."" The author's statements collectively express ""vague thoughts about not wanting to live"" or a desire not to endure the perceived future.
    While the ""Indicator"" definition mentions ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned,"" the key differentiating factor for Ideation is the presence of ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" The personal nature of the lament (""I'm 21,"" ""I have 60 fucking years left,"" ""it wasn't really good"" for *me*) makes this a personal expression of not wanting to live, rather than just abstract dissatisfaction. The Ideation definition also states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" In this case, a desire not to live the anticipated life *is* expressed.
    No specific plan or past attempt is mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""passive suicidal,"" ""suicidal,"" and ""suicide by cop.""
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post is a commentary or opinion piece, not expressing personal emotional distress from the author. It expresses a viewpoint on how to interact with others.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Suicide by cop"" is mentioned as a potential method, but it's in the context of what *someone else* (""they"") might do, not the author.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the words ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" are used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The author is discussing the potential actions and thoughts of *other* people (""someone who's passive suicidal,"" ""they may just think""). The author is not expressing their own desire to die. The rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"" is key here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""Suicide by cop"" is mentioned. However, this is presented as a potential action of *another person* the post is describing, not a plan by the author of the post.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation from the author.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post is a general statement or opinion about a hypothetical scenario or a type of interaction. It does not refer to the author's personal past events or current/future intentions regarding suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly discusses suicide and suicidal behavior. However, it does so in the context of *other people* (""someone who's passive suicidal,"" ""they may just think"").
    *   The author is not expressing any personal suicidal thoughts, feelings, desire to die, plans, or past attempts. The post is a commentary or an observation.
    *   According to the rule: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   **Ideation** requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" *from the author*. This is not present.
    *   **Behavior** requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" *by the author*. This is not present.
    *   **Attempt** requires description of ""past attempts at suicide"" *by the author*. This is not present.
    *   Since the author is not expressing personal suicidality, it falls to **Indicator**.
    *   The definition of ""Indicator"" states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" This post *does* mention suicide explicitly. However, if ""explicit expression concerning suicide"" is interpreted as ""explicit expression *of the author's own suicidality*"", then the post lacks this. Given that Ideation, Behavior, and Attempt are clearly not met *for the author*, Indicator is the most appropriate category. The post discusses suicide but does not indicate the *author* is suicidal. It's a general discussion or opinion.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""think that might be the way I choose to go,"" referring to using an insulin pump with ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button."" This strongly implies a suicidal plan. It also mentions, ""Thought about doing it a couple times.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post mentions, ""Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life"" and ""hate being a burden,"" indicating significant emotional distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method (insulin overdose) and means (insulin pump, ""100s of units of insulin"") are identified. The person is contemplating this as a future action if they get an insulin pump (""getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible""). This shows consideration of a specific plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post says, ""almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens."" This is ambiguous and not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt; ""almost"" suggests it wasn't a completed action, and it could have been an accidental medical event. ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up"" refers to past ideation and consideration of plans, but explicitly states no action was taken.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" in the context of a lethal insulin dose is a clear, albeit indirect, expression of wanting to die. ""Thought about doing it a couple times"" also indicates suicidal thoughts.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.** The expression of wanting to die via a specific method is clear enough to move beyond 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, using an insulin pump to deliver ""100s of units of insulin"" is a specific method (insulin overdose) and specific means (insulin pump).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The person is actively considering this method if they acquire an insulin pump (""getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible""). They have also thought about ""how to do it"" previously. This indicates mental preparation and planning.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** The plan (insulin overdose via pump with a large quantity) is explicit. The contingency is on acquiring the means, but the plan itself is specific.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The primary focus is on current ideation and potential future intentions (""think that might be the way I choose to go""). There are also references to past ideation (""Thought about doing it a couple times"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No. ""Almost went into shock"" is not described as a suicide attempt. ""Thought about doing it... but didn't"" is explicitly not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond 'Indicator' as it expresses a desire to die and discusses methods.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no clear past attempt is described. ""Almost went into shock"" is insufficient as it's not explicitly linked to a suicidal act.
    *   The distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts... *without any specific plan*."" It also states, ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
        *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons...).""
    *   The post contains:
        1.  Explicit suicidal thoughts (""the way I choose to go"").
        2.  A specific method (insulin overdose).
        3.  Specific means (insulin pump).
        4.  Mention of quantity (""100s of units"").
    *   This constitutes ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide"" and mentions ""a plan"" with a ""specific method"" and ""lethal medication/drugs"" (insulin in overdose) and ""tools"" (insulin pump). Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior'. The plan is explicit, even if its execution is contingent on acquiring the pump.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""☹️"" (sadness), ""tired of everything"", ""Worst birthday ever !"" (despair, hopelessness).

    *   **Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means)** No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" is concerning and suggests immediacy, but it does not constitute an *explicit plan* with a specified method or means as per the definition of 'Behavior' (e.g., ""suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations..."").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill yourself"") and the desire to act on it (""well I do""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
        *   'Ideation' is for explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.
        *   'Behavior' requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan (specific method, preparations).
    *   ""I have a chance right now"" expresses an immediate opportunity but does not specify *how* the person intends to act (e.g., no mention of pills, a weapon, a location). The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". ""Having a chance"" is not, in itself, an explicit plan or method.
    *   Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and the lack of a *specific* method or preparation, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category. The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation with a sense of immediacy, but the plan component for 'Behavior' is not met with sufficient explicitness.

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""stressed"", ""bawling"", ""mental health ... bad"", ""haven't talked to anyone"", ""I don't want to do this anymore"", ""crying myself to sleep"", ""fucked up my head"", ""confused"", ""trying to keep myself happy"", ""friends have all left me"", ""none of those things help anymore"", ""incredibly desolate"", ""mental crutches ... breakdown and are useless"", ""feel so pathetic"", ""this all means nothing"". Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, stress, isolation.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I'm finally considering suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""considering suicide"" directly implies thoughts about ending one's life. ""I don't want to do this anymore"" in the context of overwhelming stress and considering suicide also points in this direction.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post only mentions ""considering suicide"" but provides no details on how.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm finally considering suicide"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly states ""I'm finally considering suicide."" This is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts. There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, nor is there any description of a past attempt.
    - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there's no plan or method.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because it refers to current consideration, not a past action.
    Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""attempted to end my life"", ""kill myself"", ""committed"", ""wrists and thighs are bleeding"", ""knife"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""shaking and bawling"", ""worst feeling"", ""worst suspense"", ""too much of a pussy"", ""living life as a shell is bullshit"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Method mentioned is ""knife"". Action taken: ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"", ""I put down my knife"".
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post explicitly states ""I just attempted to end my life."" This is a description of a very recent past event.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""attempted to end my life"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I was ready leave eveything"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""knife"". The act of cutting leading to ""wrists and thighs are bleeding"" is also a clear method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act itself (""attempted"", ""bleeding"") is beyond preparation; it's an action taken.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent past event: ""I *just* attempted"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the entire post is a description of an attempt that just occurred.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post starts with ""I just attempted to end my life."" This is a direct statement about a past action, albeit very recent. The definition of **Attempt** is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    The post details the action: ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"" and ""I put down my knife."" This is a concrete action that happened in the past (the immediate past).
    While 'Behavior' includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior,"" the primary framing of this post is the *description of an attempt that has just occurred*. The self-harm described is part of that attempt. The use of past tense (""attempted,"" ""was ready,"" ""put down"") further supports that it's describing a concluded (though very recent) event. The definition of 'Attempt' fits best because the post is a narrative of a past suicidal action.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die/kill oneself (""wanting to [attempt suicide],"" ""feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. Therefore, it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide,"" so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but without any specific plan. This perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ending my life tonight"", ""Killing myself is the only escape"", ""slit my wrists with some scissors"".

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Anger (""what the fuck""), frustration at being prevented (""this is like preventing someone to get euthanized"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself"". While the specific method or preparations are not detailed *in this post*, the existence of ""a plan"" is clearly stated. The family's reaction (""watching me"") suggests the plan was perceived as concrete.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No explicit mention of a completed past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   The definition of ""Behavior"" states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
        The post explicitly says ""my plan to kill myself."" This is a mention of a plan. The phrase ""my plan"" implies that the individual has conceived specific details (method, means, timing), even if those details are not enumerated in this particular post. The fact that the family was alerted to ""my plan"" and is now ""watching"" the person suggests the plan was specific enough to be taken seriously.
        ""Ideation"" is defined as ""without any specific plan"". This post explicitly mentions ""my plan"", so it is not ""without any specific plan"".
        The post *mentions* a plan. The plan itself (referred to by ""my plan"") would inherently involve some form of explicit planning (method/means) for it to be a ""plan to kill myself."" The post confirms the existence of this formulated plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current or very recent plan (""my plan"") that has been discovered, and the individual expresses current frustration about this. The intention seems to be ongoing or recently thwarted.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and a ""plan to kill myself.""
    - It is not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    - It is not ""Ideation"" because ""Ideation"" is defined as ""without any specific plan."" This post explicitly states ""my plan.""
    - It is not ""Attempt"" because it does not describe a past attempt.
    - It fits ""Behavior"" because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" (i.e., ""my plan""). The plan being referred to (""my plan"") implies it has ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken,"" even if those specifics are not detailed in this particular message.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""im gonna kill myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The statement is direct and declarative. Concern for ""my baby"" might indicate some remaining ties but also a sense of finality.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Plan: Yes, ""im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now."" This indicates a timeline.
        *   Preparations: Yes, ""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks."" This is a planned behavioral change leading up to the stated act.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""Would this kill me"" directly relates to death.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Not explicitly stated, but the nature of the question implies significant distress and consideration of life-ending actions.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post lists ""Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol."" This is a specific list of substances and quantities, implying a method (overdose) and the means.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""Would this kill me"" is an inquiry about lethality. While not a direct statement like ""I want to die,"" it strongly implies consideration of actions that would lead to death, thus expressing a desire to know if these actions would be fatal. This can be interpreted as an indirect expression of wanting to die or at least seriously contemplating it.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the method implied is overdose by consuming the listed substances: ""Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Listing specific substances and quantities suggests a thought-out plan and potentially the acquisition or consideration of acquiring these means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The question ""Would this kill me"" refers to a potential current or future action.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post asks ""Would this kill me,"" which is a clear indication of considering a lethal outcome. This goes beyond general distress.
    *   The post lists specific substances (""Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol""). This constitutes a specific method (overdose) and the means are clearly identified.
    *   The definition of **Behavior** states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs...).""
    *   The phrase ""Would this kill me"" coupled with the list of specific drugs and quantities fits ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (or at least thoughts directly related to causing one's own death) and a ""specific method"" involving ""lethal medication/drugs.""
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because the intent regarding death is quite clear, and specific means are mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because a specific plan/method (the combination of listed drugs) is present. 'Ideation' is *without* a specific plan.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because it's a question about a potential future action, not a description of a past action.

    The post combines a query about lethality with a specific list of means (drugs and alcohol in specified quantities). This aligns directly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

396,I'm a complete lost cause and nothing I do can change it. All I have ever done since I got back from uni was become constantly stuck. I've never had any skills that are useful to anyone. My family are giving up on me my dad hardly talks to me and I'm a constant burden on my sister and I'll never be able to help my mum in anyway. Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family. Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The word ""attempts"" is used (""Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably"") but refers to attempts to improve life circumstances (e.g., job applications), not suicide attempts.
    *   Note emotional indicators: Strong indicators of hopelessness (""complete lost cause"", ""nothing I do can change it"", ""always going to fail""), worthlessness (""never had any skills that are useful""), being a burden (""constant burden on my sister""), failure (""failed miserably"", ""big fuck up of the family"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that suicide is not explicitly mentioned.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there's no ideation expressed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It describes current feelings of hopelessness and failure based on past experiences (since uni, job applications) and a bleak outlook on the future (""always going to fail"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, the ""attempts"" mentioned are not suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant general distress, hopelessness, feelings of failure, and being a burden. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or self-harm. According to the definition, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits that description.

398,"I wrote a note today. I've been struggling with this my whole life. But always I felt that there was some light at the end of the tunnel if only i could just get to it. Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more,"" ""I just can't continue,"" ""I cant keep going like this."" These strongly imply a desire for life to end.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""struggling,"" ""light has disappeared,"" ""severe anxiety,"" ""worthless person,"" ""at the end of my rope,"" ""wits end,"" ""no results,"" ""don't know how much longer I can keep going."" Strong hopelessness and despair are evident.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I wrote a note today."" This is a significant preparation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital."" This occurred ""last night."" While it indicates a crisis and intervention, it's not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt by the poster (e.g., ""I tried to X""). It could be for severe ideation or a mental health crisis. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) Yes. ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more,"" ""lately it feels like I just can't continue,"" ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this."" These phrases clearly express a desire for life to end or an inability to continue living.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) No specific method for a future act is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) Yes, ""I wrote a note today."" A suicide note is a form of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily focuses on current feelings (""Lately It seems like that light has disappeared,"" ""I don't know what to do anymore,"" ""lately it feels like I just can't continue"") and recent actions/preparations (""I wrote a note today,"" ""reached out for help last night""). The intention seems current/imminent.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The ER visit ""last night"" is mentioned. However, it's not explicitly detailed as a suicide attempt by the poster. It could have been an intervention due to severe distress or ideation. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The description is not specific enough to confirm a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting life to end (""can't continue,"" ""fear of non-existence after death doesn't deter me""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   The post mentions a specific preparation: ""I wrote a note today."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...).""
    *   While a specific method isn't detailed, the act of writing a note is a significant preparatory behavior.
    *   The ER visit is recent but not clearly defined as a past suicide attempt by the poster. The primary focus is on the current state and the note written ""today.""
    *   Given the explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and the mention of a preparatory action (writing a note), the category 'Behavior' is the most appropriate. The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)."" This post fits this definition.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Tried to end my life again."" - This is a direct mention of a suicide attempt.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Implied by the act of trying to end life and the failure (""Didn't work"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: Not mentioned in this post.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again."" clearly refers to past actions. The word ""again"" signifies multiple past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - Yes, ""end my life"" is an explicit reference to suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes, implied by the action of trying to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - The phrasing ""Tried didn't work"" and ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work"" clearly indicates past events.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - Yes, the post describes actions taken (""Tried to end my life"") that failed (""didn't work"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post states ""Tried to end my life again"" and ""Tried didn't work."" This explicitly describes past actions undertaken with the intent to die, which were unsuccessful. This aligns directly with the definition of ""Attempt"": ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The post describes concrete past actions.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""deserve to die"", ""deserve to be dead"", ""deserve a fucking bullet in my head"", ""want someone to stomp me out"", ""wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat"". These are strong expressions related to death and violent ways of dying.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness (""there is no better, this is it""), despair, intense self-loathing (""self-absorbed whiny piece of shit"", ""burden"", ""monster"", ""I suck""), worthlessness (""I don't *deserve* to get better""), anger.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states, ""I have no plans"". However, it mentions specific methods of death: ""a fucking bullet in my head"" and ""slit my fucking throat"". These are mentioned in the context of what the person feels they *deserve* or *wishes someone else would do*, not as a personal plan they intend to carry out.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, very clearly. ""I deserve to die"", ""I deserve to be dead"", ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head"", ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat"". These are direct and strong expressions of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""bullet in my head"" and ""slit my fucking throat"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No. The post explicitly states, ""I have no plans"". The methods are mentioned as desired outcomes or what the person feels they deserve, rather than as part of a formulated personal plan.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** The post explicitly denies having a plan, even though methods are mentioned. The methods are part of the ideation (how they wish to die) rather than a concrete plan of action by the individual.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current feelings and desires.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit and strong expressions of wanting to die and feeling deserving of death by violent means (""deserve a fucking bullet in my head"", ""wish someone would ... slit my fucking throat""). This clearly goes beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   These expressions constitute suicidal ideation: ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I have no plans"". According to the 'Behavior' definition, it must include ""explicit planning like a specific method *or preparations taken*"". While methods are mentioned, they are not presented as part of a personal plan to commit suicide; rather, they are what the person feels they deserve or wishes others would do. The explicit denial of a plan (""I have no plans"") is crucial.
    *   The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" supports classifying this as 'Ideation' because, despite method mentions, the *personal plan* component is explicitly negated.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as there is no mention of past actions.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit suicidal thoughts/desire to die, with methods mentioned as part of the ideation, but without a specific personal plan to commit suicide (and an explicit denial of such a plan).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""I will die alone."" - General statement about future death.
        *   ""I'm only alive by obligation."" - Implies not wanting to be alive but for an external reason.
        *   ""My parents don't deserve to bury their child. But the second they're gone, so am I."" - This is a crucial phrase. ""So am I"" (gone/dead) is linked to the parents' death, implying a future suicidal action once the ""obligation"" is removed.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):
        *   Hopelessness: ""what's the fucking point?"", ""I don't even try anymore"".
        *   Despair/Sadness: ""I'm just a fucking sad man"", ""Noone. So that's my company, forever. Noone.""
        *   Self-loathing: ""hideous fucking mutant"", ""fat retard"".
        *   Emptiness: ""I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness.""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The condition ""the second they're gone"" is a trigger or timing, not a method.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
        *   ""I'm only alive by obligation"" strongly implies a desire to not be alive if not for the obligation.
        *   ""But the second they're [parents] gone, so am I."" In this context, ""so am I"" means ""I will also be gone/dead."" This is a direct expression of an intention to die, contingent on an event. This counts as an explicit expression of a suicidal thought or feeling, as per the 'Ideation' definition (""a desire to not be alive any longer"").
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the exact words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are absent, the phrase ""the second they're gone, so am I,"" combined with ""I'm only alive by obligation,"" makes the suicidal intent quite clear and not vague. It's an explicit statement of future self-caused death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. (No tools, locations, substances).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. (No notes, acquiring means).
    *   The timing (""the second they're gone"") is a condition, not a plan or method of how the act would be carried out.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No explicit plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings of obligation and despair, and a future intention (""the second they're gone, so am I"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator**: This category is for posts lacking explicit expression concerning suicide, or general distress. The statement ""the second they're gone, so am I"" is more than general distress or a vague feeling about dying; it's a specific, conditional statement of intent to die.
    *   **Ideation**: This category fits. The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""I'm only alive by obligation"") and a ""stronger, more explicit desire to end ones life"" (""the second they're gone, so am I""). This intention to die is present, albeit conditional and without a specific method detailed.
    *   **Behavior**: This category requires mention of a plan or method. No specific method (tools, location, substances) or preparations are mentioned. The condition for the action is not a method itself.
    *   **Attempt**: This category is for past attempts. No past attempts are described.

    The phrase ""the second they're gone, so am I"" is a clear and explicit expression of a suicidal thought and future intention, even if euphemistically phrased. It signifies a desire to not be alive that will be acted upon under a specific condition. This aligns well with the definition of 'Ideation'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No. The post says ""I have a plan"" but does not detail what the plan entails (no specific method, tools, location, or substances are mentioned).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No, not mentioned in the post.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)"". The post mentions the *existence* of a plan but does not provide these explicit details of the plan itself.
    *   Rule: ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"". Since the post does not detail the plan with specific methods or preparations, it does not meet the ""explicit planning"" criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current/future intentions (""bad urges tonight"", ""thinking of killing myself"", ""I have a plan"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts (""suicidal ones"", ""thinking of killing myself""), so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It also states, ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken...""
    *   The post *mentions* having a plan (""I have a plan""). However, it does *not* include ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"" as required by the 'Behavior' definition. The *details* of the plan (method, means, location, preparations) are absent from the post.
    *   Since the post lacks the specific details of a plan (method, means, etc.) that would constitute ""explicit planning"" as per the 'Behavior' definition, and given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", the post falls into 'Ideation'. The person expresses suicidal thoughts and claims to have a plan, but the plan itself is not described in the post with the required level of specificity for 'Behavior'.

404,"The questionnaires that include a question asking if I've had suicidal thoughts actually make me less likely to talk about. Because I know it'll cause a massive issue and result in a lot of stress. There going to ask me too many details, and be too insistent with their questioning. I find therapy tough enough as it is, and if lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff, then that's great. Well it's great till it starts to happen more and more frequently. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"" is mentioned multiple times. ""grave I dug myself"" is a metaphor for a dire situation, potentially linked to these thoughts.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""massive issue,"" ""stress,"" ""therapy tough enough,"" ""lying about the suicidal thoughts,"" ""starts to happen more and more frequently"" (referring to suicidal thoughts), ""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" (implies hopelessness, feeling trapped).
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post discusses having ""suicidal thoughts"" and acknowledges they are happening ""more and more frequently."" The statement ""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself,"" in the context of admitting to suicidal thoughts, implies a struggle with the will to live or a desire for the current suffering to end, which aligns with the definition of ideation (""a desire to not be alive any longer"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since no plan or method is mentioned, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current ""suicidal thoughts"" (""starts to happen more and more frequently"") and a current state of distress (""not sure if I'm strong enough"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts."" This moves it beyond 'indicator'.
    *   The thoughts are described as current and increasing in frequency.
    *   The phrase ""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" expresses hopelessness and a struggle directly linked to these thoughts, fulfilling the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" or ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" part of the 'ideation' definition.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations, so it is not 'behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past attempt, so it is not 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the category 'ideation' is the most appropriate.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""nearly killing myself"", ""shooting up the school"" (in past context, linked to self-harm idea), ""I fucking hate living"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""rotting away"", ""I fucking hate living"", anger (""fucking hate""), feelings of injustice (""Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?""). Strong distress, hopelessness, and anger.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""shooting up the school"" is mentioned as a past consideration alongside ""killing myself"". No current specific plans or methods for suicide are detailed.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""nearly killing myself"" strongly suggests a past event where the person came very close to dying by their own actions, which can be interpreted as a description of a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I fucking hate living"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""shooting up the school"" is mentioned in a past context (""bullied me into nearly... shooting up the school""). This is linked with ""nearly killing myself"". No *current* specific methods for suicide are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No current signs of preparation.
    *   The post does not detail a current plan, so 'Behavior' is unlikely for the current state.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""nearly killing myself/shooting up the school"") and current feelings/intentions (""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"", ""I fucking hate living"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? ""nearly killing myself"" is a description. The phrase implies an action was taken that brought the person close to death. This is more than ""merely thought of an attempt"". It suggests a concrete action almost resulted in death.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""killing myself"") and a strong current desire not to be alive (""I fucking hate living""), which points towards 'Ideation' or higher.
    *   The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" describes a past event. If ""nearly"" implies a concrete action was taken that almost resulted in death (e.g., an overdose that was survived, an action interrupted), then it fits the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. A concrete action need to have happened in the past"". ""Nearly killing myself"" is stronger than ""merely thought of an attempt"". It suggests an action that brought one to the brink of death.
    *   While there's current strong ideation (""I fucking hate living""), the description of a past event like ""nearly killing myself"" is a key factor for the 'Attempt' category. The definition of 'Attempt' focuses on historic actions.
    *   The post does not describe a current plan with specific methods, so it's not 'Behavior'.
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Given the interpretation that ""nearly killing myself"" describes a past suicidal action that almost succeeded, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate category. The current ideation is also noted, but the 'Attempt' category is for posts describing past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions ""Suicide"" as a ""quick solution."" This is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""want to find a way to get away from it all"" further supports a desire to not be alive. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide.
    - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    - It fits 'Ideation' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive, but without a specific plan.
    - It's not 'Behavior' because there's no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.
    - It's not 'Attempt' because there's no description of a past attempt.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""cutting my self for a long time""
        *   ""my body is covered in scars from head to toe""
        *   ""self mutilation"" (diagnosis)
        *   ""contemplating suicide""
        *   ""if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together""
        *   ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.""
    *   Emotional indicators:
        *   ""subvert the pain""
        *   ""feeling numb""
        *   ""don't get any joy out of life""
        *   ""don't feel love for anyone""
        *   ""I'm fucking lost here""
        *   ""didn't want to live before I met her""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   The author describes ongoing self-harm: ""cutting my self"".
        *   Conditional plan: ""if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" (method not specified).
        *   Conditional intent: ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it"" (method not specified).
    *   References to past attempts:
        *   Author: No explicit past *suicide attempts* mentioned for the author. ""Cutting"" is described as self-harm/self-mutilation, not explicitly as a past suicide attempt by the author.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""contemplating suicide"", ""kill her self"", ""ending it"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""contemplating suicide"", ""didn't want to live before"", ""I'm ending it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? For the author's own suicide, no specific method is detailed beyond ""ending it"" or doing it ""together"" (method unspecified). However, ""cutting"" is a form of self-harm.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not explicitly beyond the agreement for a joint suicide.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior"". The post clearly states ""I've been cutting my self for a long time"". This is self-harming behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to current/future intentions: ""contemplating suicide"" (current), ""we will do it together"" (future conditional), ""I'm ending it"" (future conditional).
    *   Past attempts: No past suicide attempts described for the author. The self-harm (""cutting"") is long-standing.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""contemplating suicide"", ""I'm ending it"").
    The post also clearly describes ongoing self-harming behavior: ""I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe.""
    The definition of **Behavior** is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior.""
    This post meets the criteria because it has:
    1.  Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""contemplating suicide"").
    2.  Exhibits self-harming behavior (""cutting my self"").
    Therefore, it falls into the 'Behavior' category. The conditional plans further support this, but the presence of suicidal ideation and active self-harm is sufficient.

I'm a dependent person. I need her and she needs to be alone. So that means I need to die because it's better than living in pain. I don't know what to do. And everybody keeps telling me to do things I can't do. So I'm fucked.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself"", ""I need to die"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""worse"", ""Life isn't worth it"", ""I can't"", ""I'm alone"", ""pain"", ""I'm fucked"", ""dependent person"", hopelessness (""Life isn't worth it without her"", ""it's better than living in pain"").

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current feelings and intentions (""I need to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill yourself"") and expresses a clear desire to die (""I need to die"", ""Life isn't worth it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The person even states ""I don't know what to do."" This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""kill yourself"" (quoted from mom)
        *   ""shoot yourself"" (quoted from mom)
        *   ""try to kill yourself again"" (quoted from dad, referring to the poster)
        *   ""cut your wrists again"" (quoted from dad, referring to the poster)
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post itself is a list of abusive quotes. The act of posting this implies significant distress and a cry for help or documentation of abuse. The quotes describe a highly toxic and unsupportive environment for the poster.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: Methods like ""gun,"" ""shoot,"" ""cut wrists"" are mentioned, but in the context of parental taunts or references to past actions by the poster. There's no indication of current planning or preparation by the poster in this specific post.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: Yes, multiple direct references:
        *   ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" (Dad)
        *   ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"" (Dad)
        *   ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" (Dad)
        These phrases explicitly state that the poster has made attempts or engaged in serious self-harm (cutting wrists, which in this context likely refers to suicidal behavior) in the past.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""try to kill yourself again"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive *from the poster*? Not directly from the poster in this post. The post is a compilation of quotes from parents. However, the parents' quotes refer to the poster's past suicidal actions.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""gun,"" ""shoot,"" ""cut wrists"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for a current attempt. The methods are mentioned in the context of past actions or parental taunts.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The key phrases ""try to kill yourself *again*"" and ""cut your wrists *again*"" clearly refer to past events/actions by the poster.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, through the parents' quoted statements. The parents are acknowledging and taunting the poster about previous attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post's content, specifically the quotes from the father (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?""), directly describes past suicidal attempts or severe self-harm by the poster. The definition of ""Attempt"" is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past."" The parents' statements confirm that such concrete actions have happened in the poster's past. While the post doesn't detail the attempts, it explicitly states they occurred.
    It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    It is not 'ideation' because while ideation might be present, the focus of the relevant phrases is on past actions.
    It is not 'behavior' because there's no mention of a current plan or ongoing self-harm behavior *in this post*. The methods mentioned are tied to past events or taunts.
    The most fitting category is 'Attempt' because the post's content (the quoted statements) describes past suicide attempts by the person writing the post.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself"", ""Kim's"" (interpreted as ""kms"" - kill myself).
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Implied desperation (""I just need a way"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post is actively asking for a method: ""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?"". This is seeking information to form a plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill yourself"", ""kms"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""kill yourself"", ""I just need a way to kms"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The user is *asking for* a method (""What's the least painful way""). While a specific method isn't stated as chosen, the act of soliciting a method is a direct step in planning.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Actively seeking a method is a form of preparation or planning.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Asking for a method is an explicit action towards formulating a plan and can be seen as a preparation. It's a step beyond merely thinking about suicide; it's an action to find a means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions suicide and the desire to die (""kill yourself"", ""kms""). Crucially, it goes beyond expressing ideation by actively seeking a method (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""). This act of soliciting a method is a form of ""explicit planning"" or ""preparation"" as described in the 'Behavior' category. The user is not just thinking about suicide; they are taking an active step to find out *how* to do it. This is more than 'Ideation' (which is ""without any specific plan""). Asking for a method is part of forming that specific plan. Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal note"" is a direct mention related to suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside"" indicates significant emotional or physical distress.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""write a suicidal note"" is a specific preparation. The word ""again"" suggests this preparatory action has been considered or done before.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""again"" implies a past instance of writing a suicidal note, but not necessarily a past *attempt* at suicide itself.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal note.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not a direct ""I want to die,"" writing a ""suicidal note"" strongly implies suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for ending life (e.g., pills, weapon) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""write a suicidal note"" is a clear sign of preparation. The definition of ""Behavior"" explicitly includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"".
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. However, ""writing a suicide note"" is listed as an example of preparation under Behavior, making it quite explicit.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again"" refers to a current or imminent future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, a past *attempt* at suicide is not described. The word ""again"" refers to the act of writing a note, which is a preparation, not necessarily a completed attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal note,"" so it's not ""Indicator.""
    *   The post goes beyond just thoughts (""Ideation"") because it mentions a specific preparatory action: ""write a suicidal note.""
    *   The definition of ""Behavior"" includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)."" Writing a suicide note is a preparation.
    *   It is not ""Attempt"" because the post describes a future intention (""I think I'm going to write"") rather than a past completed action of trying to end one's life. The ""again"" refers to writing a note, not necessarily making an attempt.

Therefore, the category ""Behavior"" is the most appropriate because the post describes an intention to engage in a preparatory act (writing a suicide note) directly linked to suicide.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""slaying myself"" is a direct mention of suicide/self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses extreme intentions, which can be linked to distress, though not explicitly stated as sadness or hopelessness. The primary focus is on the violent act.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation for ""slaying myself"" is mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes, ""slaying myself"" is an explicit mention of committing suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""slaying myself"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No. The post mentions ""slaying myself"" but does not specify how.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no plan is mentioned, this rule applies.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: ""I will end up... or maybe just slaying myself"" refers to future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains an explicit mention of suicide (""slaying myself"") and a direct expression of wanting to die. However, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. According to the definitions:
    *   **Indicator:** Lacks explicit expression concerning suicide. This post *has* explicit expression.
    *   **Ideation:** Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan. This fits.
    *   **Behavior:** Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts *and also mentions a plan*. This post lacks a plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Describes past attempts. This post refers to future intentions.

    Therefore, the post falls into the 'Ideation' category because it explicitly mentions suicide but does not detail a plan or method.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"". It also states, ""I don't want to die— I want to live"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses feelings of laziness, shame (""my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody""), feeling overwhelmed, feeling stupid, passivity, mediocrity, and general dissatisfaction with lack of action and progress in life.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the term ""suicidal ideation"" is used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post says ""I don't want to die— I want to live,"" but immediately clarifies ""and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" This indicates that suicidal thoughts (ideation) are present, even if there's a conflicting desire to live. The term ""suicidal ideation"" itself is an explicit expression of having suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""suicidal ideation"" is described as a current state or feeling (""my suicidal ideation stems from..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly uses the term ""suicidal ideation,"" which is a direct admission of having suicidal thoughts. While the writer also expresses a desire to live, the acknowledgement of ""suicidal ideation"" as stemming from their shame confirms the presence of these thoughts. According to the definition of **Ideation**: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This post fits this definition because ""suicidal ideation"" is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, and no plan is mentioned. It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned via ""suicidal ideation"". It is not 'Behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned. It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""shoot myself in the head"", ""don't die"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"". This specifies a tool (handgun) and an action (shoot in the head).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The post mentions ""wanna get my dad's handgun,"" which is a thought about acquiring means, even if not yet acted upon. The plan itself is specific.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current/future intentions (""I wanna get..."").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I wanna... shoot myself in the head""). It also mentions a specific plan: using ""my dad's handgun"" to ""shoot myself in the head"". This is a clear method and means. The subsequent hesitation and decision ""so I'm not risking it"" is about the execution of this specific plan, but the plan itself is explicitly stated and considered within the post. According to the definition of 'Behavior', it ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... tools/weapons (e.g. ...guns...))"". The mention of a handgun as the tool and shooting as the method fits this definition. The plan is explicit.

My life wasnt good before getting sick, but now, it has become unbearable.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains phrases like ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving."" These don't explicitly use the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" but point to a profound lack of value in life.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong emotional indicators are present: ""helpless, angry and sad,"" ""unbearable,"" ""hate this world,"" ""nothing i can enjoy anymore."" These signify deep hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts are made.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving"" are direct expressions that life has lost its value, which falls under the 'ideation' definition's ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" or at least ""vague thoughts about not wanting to live."" These are explicit statements about the perceived worthlessness of life and an implied desire for it to not continue in its current state.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there's no plan or method, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current suffering and future conditional hopelessness (""If my breathing doesnt go back to normal I cant see myself having a life worthliving"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Therefore, it is not 'attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses profound hopelessness and a clear statement that life is perceived as not worth living (""my life isnt worth living anymore,"" ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving"").
    The 'indicator' category is for posts lacking ""any explicit expression concerning suicide"" or ""direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings,"" and states that ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    However, the 'ideation' category is defined as content that ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... This can range from vague thoughts about not wanting to live to stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life (albeit without a specific plan how to do so).""
    The phrases ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving"" are explicit expressions about the fundamental value of life being nil. This is a direct indication of suicidal feelings and qualifies as an ""explicit expression of ... a desire to not be alive any longer"" or at least ""vague thoughts about not wanting to live."" It goes beyond ""general dissatisfaction"" by directly addressing the worth of life itself.
    Since there is no mention of a specific plan or method, it does not qualify for 'behavior'. There is no mention of past attempts, so it is not 'attempt'.
    The expressions used are strong enough to be considered explicit expressions of suicidal feelings, fitting the 'ideation' category.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself soon"", ""I'll be gone"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""don't see the point anymore"" indicates hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: A timeframe is mentioned (""by February""). The person is also thinking about timing (""not ... on Christmas""). No specific method (tools, location, substances) or other preparations (like a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes (""kill myself soon"", ""I'll be gone"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): A timeframe (""by February"") is mentioned, which indicates some level of planning regarding *when*. However, the definition of 'Behavior' gives examples like ""suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations"". A timeframe alone, without a method or other concrete preparations listed in the examples, might not meet the threshold for ""explicit planning"" as defined for 'Behavior'.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Given that the plan only specifies a timeframe and not a method or other preparations listed in the 'Behavior' definition's examples, there is some uncertainty.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""going to kill myself soon"", ""by February I think I'll be gone"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and a desire to die (""I'll be gone""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   There are no past attempts mentioned, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   'Behavior' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...).""
    *   The post includes a timeframe (""by February""), which is an element of planning. However, it does not mention a *specific method* or other *preparations* like those exemplified in the 'Behavior' definition (note, acquiring means, specific location for the act).
    *   The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Since the plan lacks a specific method or the types of preparations listed as examples for 'Behavior', and only includes a timeframe, it's more aligned with strong ideation that includes some temporal consideration but not a fully detailed plan as per the 'Behavior' definition. The planning isn't as explicit regarding the *means* of suicide as the 'Behavior' category seems to require based on its examples.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to die"", ""gonna end my life"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""Too many problems, im a fucked up person"" indicates distress and hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""gonna end my life this month"". ""This month"" is a timeframe, but not a specific method or detailed preparation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""gonna end my life"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I just want to die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. ""This month"" indicates intent within a timeframe but not *how*.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The mention of ""this month"" could be seen as a loose plan, but it lacks specificity regarding method or means as required by the 'behavior' definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""gonna end my life this month"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions wanting to die and ending one's life, so it's not 'indicator'.
    *   It expresses a clear desire to die and an intention to act (""gonna end my life this month"").
    *   The definition of 'behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)"". While ""this month"" indicates a timeframe for the intention, it does not specify a method or preparation.
    *   The definition of 'ideation' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This seems to fit best. The post expresses a strong desire and intent but lacks the specific plan details required for 'behavior'.
    *   The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here. The timeframe ""this month"" is not a specific plan of *how* to commit suicide.
    *   No past attempts are mentioned, so it's not 'attempt'.
    Therefore, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughs"" (typo for thoughts) is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""shitty modern world"", ""world is falling apart"", ""soon will turn into hell"", ""suffering"", ""mental illnesses"". Strong negative sentiment and hopelessness about the world.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughs"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""suicidal thoughs"" directly implies thoughts about suicide, which inherently involves not wanting to be alive or wanting to die. While not phrased as ""I want to die,"" acknowledging ""suicidal thoughts"" is a direct expression of such thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post says ""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs helped me to understood the world,"" which suggests these are thoughts the person experiences or has experienced. It's not explicitly a current plan, but an acknowledgement of having these thoughts.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughs"".
    *   This goes beyond 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" ""Suicidal thoughs"" is an explicit expression.
    *   It fits 'Ideation' because ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The post mentions ""suicidal thoughs"" but provides no plan or method.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparations.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    The explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughs"" clearly points to 'Ideation'.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post mentions a future timeframe (""on my birthday"") and an intention to ""plan it out"". This is an intention to prepare/plan, but not a description of a plan already formulated or preparations already taken (like acquiring means or writing a note). The ""plan"" is to make a plan.
    *   The definition for 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)"". The post does not contain these specific types of explicit planning or preparations. It expresses an intent to plan in the future.

    *   The post mentions an intention to ""plan it out"" and a timeframe (""on my birthday""). However, it does not specify a method, means, or concrete preparations already taken, as exemplified in the 'Behavior' definition (e.g., suicide note, acquiring weapons/medication, specific location).

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""now I've been thinking of ending it all"" and ""So what is the point anymore"" strongly express a desire to not be alive or to end one's life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': ""ending it all"" in this context is a clear expression of suicidal thought.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains strong emotional distress and explicit thoughts about ""ending it all,"" which signifies suicidal ideation. There is a clear expression of wanting to die (""thinking of ending it all"", ""what is the point anymore""). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations, which would elevate it to 'behavior'. There is no mention of a past attempt.

    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""do this once and for all,"" ""get it over with,"" ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend,"" ""my death will be following very soon."" The word ""attempt"" clearly refers to a suicide attempt in this context.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""don't wanna die""
        *   ""live till October"" (conditional on a test)
        *   ""die right after"" (in a hypothetical scenario of wasting money)

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.):
        *   Ambivalence: ""it's not like i wanna live either""
        *   Conditional hopelessness: ""cannot live if i fail""
        *   Some positive feelings: ""almost happy"", ""almost enjoying doing stuff"", ""feeling better"", ""have a purpose"". This creates a mixed emotional picture.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Mentions past methods considered or used: ""meds"", ""place to jump from"", ""blades i used to cut"".
        *   Explicitly states lack of current access or plan: ""no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep"", ""I don't even know how I'll do it"". This indicates no current specific plan or preparation.
    *   Check for references to past attempts:
        *   ""blades i used to cut"" refers to past self-harm. It is not explicitly stated whether this was a suicide attempt or non-suicidal self-injury.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"")? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""cannot live if i fail"" is a direct (though conditional) expression of not wanting to be alive. ""it's not like i wanna live either"" also points in this direction. The statement ""for the first time i don't wanna die"" implies previous desires to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. However, ""cannot live if i fail"" is a fairly explicit expression of a desire to not be alive under certain circumstances, fitting the definition of ideation (""a desire to not be alive any longer"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, past methods are mentioned (""meds"", ""place to jump from"", ""blades"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation (for a current attempt)? No. The post explicitly states, ""no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep"" and ""I don't even know how I'll do it."" This clearly indicates a lack of a current plan or preparation.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, it's quite certain there is *no* current explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past self-harm (""blades i used to cut"") and current/future conditional ideation (""cannot live if i fail"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? ""blades i used to cut"" describes a past self-harm action. It is not explicitly detailed as a *suicide attempt* (e.g., intent to die during those instances is not stated). The description is ambiguous regarding suicidal intent of the past cutting.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator**: This category is for posts lacking explicit expression concerning suicide, or only general distress. The post contains ""cannot live if i fail,"" which is an explicit (conditional) desire to not be alive, moving beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation**: This category requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
        *   ""cannot live if i fail"" and ""it's not like i wanna live either"" are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive.
        *   ""I don't even know how I'll do it"" and the stated lack of access to means confirm no specific current plan.
        *   This category seems to fit well.
    *   **Behavior**: This category requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions of a plan or self-harming behavior. While past self-harm is mentioned (""blades i used to cut""), there's no current plan or current self-harming behavior described. The rule states ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Here, there is clearly no current plan.
    *   **Attempt**: This category is for content that ""describes past attempts at suicide."" The phrase ""blades i used to cut"" describes past self-harm. However, it's not explicitly stated that these cutting episodes were suicide attempts (i.e., done with the intent to die). Self-harm can occur without suicidal intent. Given the ambiguity and lack of explicit description of a *suicide attempt*, this category is less certain than Ideation. If it were clearly a described past suicide attempt, this category would be a strong contender. However, without that clarity, relying on the clear current ideation without a plan is more appropriate.

    The strongest evidence points to current suicidal ideation (""cannot live if I fail"") without a specific plan (""I don't even know how I'll do it""). The mention of past cutting is ambiguous as a suicide attempt. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category.

And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses strong feelings of being ""drained,"" loss of ""motivation,"" work feeling ""useless,"" having ""taken my will to strive,"" feeling ""stuck in a system,"" ""exhausted,"" and ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a sense of pointlessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. While phrases like ""taken my will to strive"" and ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" convey deep despair and a loss of purpose, they are not direct, explicit statements of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Given the lack of explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire to die, this rule applies.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Not applicable as 'ideation' criteria are not met.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and a general outlook on life and the future.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness (""taken my will to strive,"" ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life""), and a general dissatisfaction with life (""stuck in a system,"" ""forced to be milked out""). However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a direct statement of wanting to die.
    According to the definition of ""Indicator"": ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    The definition of ""Ideation"" requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The post does not meet this threshold of explicitness regarding a desire to die.
    The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" further supports classifying this as 'Indicator' because suicide is not mentioned, and the desire to die is not explicitly stated, even if implied by the level of hopelessness.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and a desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond just ideation because it lists specific methods: ""slitting my wrist"", ""shoot myself with a gun"", ""cutting myself"".
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life...)."" The mention of specific methods (""slitting my wrist"", ""shoot myself with a gun"") fulfills the criteria for ""specific method"" and implies tools (knife/razor, gun). The phrase ""start cutting myself"" also points to self-harming behavior which is part of the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    Given the explicit mention of suicidal intent and specific methods, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

The post explicitly states, ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes suicidal thoughts ""for years now"" and detailed planning as a ""quarantine hobby."" It also states, ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans."" This indicates current contemplation based on well-developed plans.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The user describes extensive *planning* and *ideation*, but not a past *action* of attempting suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond 'Ideation' because it includes detailed specific plans and preparations. The user has ""calculated,"" ""tested,"" and ""determined"" aspects of several methods.
    *   The post fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide"") AND mentions specific plans with preparations taken (calculating alcohol dosage, testing noose points, identifying car timing). The user states, ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""
    *   'Attempt' is not applicable as no past action of attempting suicide is described.

The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts coupled with detailed plans and preparations (calculating dosages, testing structural integrity for hanging, planning timing for jumping in front of a car) clearly falls under the 'Behavior' category. Even though the user states they haven't acted on these plans *yet* due to feeling they ""don't deserve"" death, the detailed planning itself is the key criterion for 'Behavior' over 'Ideation'.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""pain for over 5 years"", ""cba anymore"" (can't be arsed/bothered), ""want to be out of my misery"", ""feel like abandoning everyone"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a desire for suffering to end.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" is social withdrawal, not a suicide plan.
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts. It states ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months,"" which refers to the intensity of current feelings, not past actions.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"" and expresses a strong desire to ""be out of my misery,"" indicating suicidal thoughts and feelings. However, it does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. It also does not describe a past attempt.
    - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses being at a ""low point"" and seeks advice for a ""better living,"" which implies a desire to improve life, not end it.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It's clear there's no explicit mention.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable, as there's no ideation.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current state (""Im in the low point"") and future considerations (moving to another country).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post expresses significant distress, low self-esteem, and loneliness (""low point,"" ""zero social skills/low self esteem/lonely""). However, there is no mention of suicide, death, dying, or wanting to not be alive. The user is actively seeking advice to improve their life (""need help aka ADVICE,"" ""is it worth moving in another country for better living?""). This aligns with the definition of ""Indicator"": ""general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""die a horrible painful death ASAP"". However, this is directed at ""the guy who reported my post"", not the author of the post. The classification should only concern the author.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses anger and frustration (""I hope you die"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the author.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (by the author about themselves)? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (by the author about themselves)? No. The expression ""I hope you die"" is directed at another person.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned (by the author for themselves)? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation (by the author for themselves)? No.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions (of the author regarding themselves)? The post refers to a past event (account banned) and expresses a current wish for harm to another person. It does not express any suicidal intention from the author.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described (by the author)? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post expresses strong negative emotions (anger, desire for harm to another) due to an account ban. However, there are no explicit mentions of suicide, suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts *by the author concerning themselves*. The rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"" is crucial here. The wish for death is directed outwards. The post shows ""general expressions of distress"" (anger, frustration) but lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide by the author. Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category.

Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the phrase ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others."" The primary focus is on homicidal intent: ""I will kill my bullie,"" ""I will kill her,"" ""how to murder her?""
    *   Emotional indicators: Anger, frustration, desire for ""peace"" through violence.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The poster is asking for suggestions on ""how to murder her,"" indicating a desire to plan but no specific method is stated by the poster for either murder or suicide.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly like ""I want to die."" However, by referencing a ""type of suicide"" that involves killing oneself along with others, and then stating intent to kill another (""I will kill her""), the poster implies consideration of an act that includes their own death. This constitutes an expression of suicidal thoughts in the context of a murder-suicide scenario.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for suicide are mentioned. The poster is asking for methods to murder the bully, not detailing a plan for their own suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation for suicide.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"" for suicide. Asking for a murder method does not constitute a specific plan for suicide, even if the poster is contemplating a murder-suicide. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I will kill her,"" asking for murder methods).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide."" This rules out 'Indicator' as 'Indicator' requires the post to lack ""any explicit expression concerning suicide.""
    *   The mention of a ""type of suicide"" that involves killing oneself and others, followed by the stated intent to kill the bully, indicates that the poster is contemplating an action that includes their own suicide. This is an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" as per the 'Ideation' definition.
    *   There is no specific plan or method detailed for committing suicide. The poster is soliciting methods for murder, not outlining a suicide plan. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
    *   The post does not describe any past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The most fitting category is 'Ideation' because suicide is explicitly mentioned in a way that links it to the poster's contemplated actions (a murder-suicide scenario), indicating suicidal thoughts, but without a specific plan for the suicide itself being articulated.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end it all"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""cannot do this anymore"", ""mental health really bad"", ""stress"", ""disappointment"", ""failure"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""I know exactly what to do,"" which implies the existence of a plan in the poster's mind, but the specifics of the plan (method, means, location, timing) are not detailed in the post.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""cannot do this anymore"", ""want to end it all"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are not mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (like writing a note or acquiring means) are mentioned in the post.
    *   The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" indicates that the person has formulated a plan. However, the 'Behavior' category definition states: ""It *must include* some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)."" The post does not *include* these specific details of the plan; it only asserts that a plan is known to the poster. The 'Ideation' definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" This post does not *contain* these specific ideas, it only alludes to their existence in the poster's mind. Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and since the plan's specifics are not explicitly stated in the post, it leans away from 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and future intentions (""verge of suicide"", ""want to end it all"", ""I know exactly what to do"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   The post expresses strong suicidal ideation (""verge of suicide"", ""want to end it all"").
    *   It also states, ""I know exactly what to do,"" implying a plan exists.
    *   However, the 'Behavior' definition requires that the post ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken..."" While the poster *claims* to have a plan, the post itself does not *detail* this plan (e.g., by mentioning a specific method, tool, location, or preparation). The plan's content is not shared.
    *   The 'Ideation' definition describes content with ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" suggests the person *does* have a specific plan in mind. However, the clarifying sentence in the 'Ideation' definition says, ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" Since this post does not *contain* these specific ideas, it does not cross the threshold into 'Behavior' based on the provided definitions.
    *   The rule ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies. The plan itself is not explicit in the post, only the assertion of its existence.
    *   Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' because while a plan is alluded to, its specifics are not mentioned, which is a requirement for 'Behavior'. The ideation is strong and indicates a formulated plan, but the content of the plan is not disclosed in the post.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""wanna die"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong desire for death expressed.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""kill me"" and ""wanna die"" are direct expressions related to ending one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""I just wanna die"".
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The expression ""I just wanna die"" is a clear and direct expression of wanting to not be alive, fitting the definition of ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan is mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions (""I just wanna die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I just wanna die""). This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' which states ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it does not qualify for 'Behavior'. It is not a description of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'. It is more than general distress; it's a direct expression of wanting to die, so it is not 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post expresses extreme distress, unhappiness, and a desire for change, but not explicitly death or suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Strong emotional indicators are present: ""tired of being male attracted to other males"", ""gender disphoria"", ""unhappy life"", ""molested at 5 years"", ""tired of being unhappy lost and alone"", ""tired of being depressed and always rejected"", ""want to be normal"", ""take all thoughts away from my mind"", ""everything negetive out my life"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and depression.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The person expresses a strong desire for their current state of suffering to end (""am tired of being unhappy"", ""take all thoughts away from my mind"", ""take all ... depression everything negetive out my life""), but not an explicit desire to die or cease existing. The focus is on changing their life and feelings, becoming ""normal.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since there's no explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die, this leans towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as we are not at 'ideation' or 'behavior' yet.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current suffering (""am tired"", ""am sorry i just want to be normal"") and a desire for future change (""please do a miracle"", ""take all gayness away""). It also mentions a past event (""molested at 5 years"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post shows significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and depression (""tired of being unhappy lost and alone"", ""tired of being depressed""). However, it does not contain any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The pleas are for divine intervention to change their circumstances and feelings (""make me straight make me normal"", ""take all thoughts away from my mind"", ""take all gayness away all gender disphoria all depresion everything negetive out my life"").
    According to the definition of ""Indicator"": ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.

    This post fits the ""Indicator"" category as it expresses profound distress and hopelessness without explicitly mentioning suicide or a desire to die. The phrase ""take all thoughts away from my mind"" is a plea for relief from distressing thoughts, not necessarily suicidal ones in this context.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The word ""suicidal"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post describes chronic pain (""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts,"" ""It's been 8 months, with no change in sight""), which implies significant distress and potential hopelessness.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): The phrase ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" in the context of the poster's own described chronic pain, is an expression of suicidal thoughts. While phrased as a question, it strongly implies the poster is experiencing these feelings and seeking to know if others share them. It's not a direct ""I want to die,"" but ""suicidal"" encompasses thoughts of ending one's life. Given the explicit mention of ""suicidal"" linked to their personal suffering, this points towards an expression of suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This rule applies as there's no plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current suffering (""It's been 8 months"") and current feelings (""Anyone suicidal..."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal."" According to the 'Indicator' definition (""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'""), the presence of ""suicidal"" means it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   The question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" is interpreted as an expression of the poster's own suicidal thoughts, even if seeking validation. This fits the 'Ideation' definition (""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category.

    *   References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts by the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (by the poster about themselves)? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used by the poster in reference to themselves. The word ""suicide"" is used in ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I don't think I can go on much longer"", ""I'm over life"", ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"". These are direct expressions of wanting life to end.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. No tools, locations, substances, or specific actions for suicide are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" could be interpreted as a form of setting a condition or a final task before giving up, but it's not a preparation in terms of acquiring means or a specific plan for the act of suicide itself as defined for 'Behavior' (e.g., suicide note, lethal medication, tools).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The expressions of wanting to die (""can't go on much longer"", ""its finally over"", ""looking forward to ... death"") refer to current feelings and future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No past attempts by the poster are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains very strong expressions of wanting to die and not wanting to live anymore (""I don't think I can go on much longer"", ""I'm over life"", ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"").
    *   While the word ""suicide"" is not explicitly used by the poster for themselves, the desire to die is explicitly stated. The definition of 'Ideation' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". This fits.
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' says ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" and ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" However, ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"" goes beyond general dissatisfaction or a vague feeling; it's an explicit desire for death. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" is noted, but the desire to die *is* explicitly mentioned, fulfilling the 'Ideation' criteria.
    *   There is no specific plan or method mentioned for how the person would end their life. ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" is a statement about a final act or timeline, not a method of suicide. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' which requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt by the poster.

    Based on the explicit desire to die (""looking forward to ... death"", ""I'm over life"") without a specific plan or method, the category is 'Ideation'.

    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes, through discussion of methods like starving, hanging, and using a gun to end life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. ""I'd have a better place in heaven"", ""I'll at least be dead by the end of the week"", ""I just want my death to come faster"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): Yes. Starvation, hanging, gun.
    *   Are there signs of preparation?: Yes. ""I've started to try and starve myself"" indicates an action has begun. The statement ""if I keep starving myself I'll at least be dead by the end of the week"" suggests a plan with a timeline.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current and future intentions. ""I've started to try..."", ""I'll at least be dead by the end of the week"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I just want my death to come faster"", ""dead by the end of the week""). It also mentions specific methods (""starve myself"", ""hanging myself"", ""gun""). Crucially, it states ""I've started to try and starve myself"", which is an explicit mention of a plan being enacted and self-harming behavior. The timeline ""dead by the end of the week"" further solidifies the plan. This clearly fits the 'Behavior' category, as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific method, and an indication of action/preparation.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up. I deserve a chance to show everyone exactly how bad I've been hurting, and fuck you if you think I'm selfish. I just need a chance to help myself.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""Is it suicidal..."" - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal"".
        *   ""if I die then I die"" - Mentions dying.
        *   ""willing to accept when my time has come"" - Implies acceptance of death.
        *   ""Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier"" - Mentions dying.
    *   Emotional indicators:
        *   ""I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be."" - Hopelessness, devaluing life.
        *   ""Especially when I see that the future is really grim."" - Hopelessness, despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it"" - Explicitly states no active plans.
        *   ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's"" - This is a form of self-neglect that could lead to premature death, but it's passive rather than an active plan with a method as described for 'behavior'.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Is it suicidal..."".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be"" strongly implies a desire for life to not continue or be prolonged, fitting the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" part of ideation. The acceptance of dying (""if I die then I die"") in the context of questioning if their behavior is ""suicidal"" also points to this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No active methods for suicide are mentioned. Stopping doctor visits is a passive behavior.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for an active suicide attempt. The post explicitly states, ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it.""
    *   The act of ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" is a form of self-neglect, but the 'behavior' category emphasizes explicit planning with methods like tools, locations, substances. The user denies having ""plans to end it,"" which usually refers to active plans. Given the rule ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and the passive nature of the self-neglect compared to active methods, this does not meet the 'behavior' criteria for a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings, current behavior (stopped visiting doctors), and current lack of active plans.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" so it's not 'Indicator'.
    *   The post expresses thoughts about life not being worth prolonging (""not worth pushing my life further"") and questions if their self-neglect (""not go to the doctors"") is ""suicidal."" This aligns with ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    *   The post explicitly states, ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it,"" which means it lacks a specific plan as required for 'Behavior'. Stopping doctor visits, while a serious form of self-neglect, is not presented as an active plan or method in the way 'Behavior' defines it (e.g., tools, specific actions to cause immediate death).
    *   There is no mention of past attempts, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings, a desire for life to not be prolonged (interpreted as a desire to not be alive any longer in this context), and no specific active plan to commit suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""fucking hate myself"", ""too depressed"", ""too ugly"", ""too lazy"". Strong expressions of self-loathing, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""starve myself"" is mentioned in the context of weight loss, not explicitly as a suicide method. The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" suggests a lack of current plan or capability to act.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""kill myself"" implies a desire to die, even if followed by a statement of being unable to act on it. The thought is present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): ""starve myself"" is mentioned, but in the context of weight loss due to thyroid issues, not directly as a suicide plan. The primary statement is ""too much of a coward to kill myself,"" which negates an active plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and thoughts (""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which constitutes suicidal thoughts. However, it immediately follows with ""too much of a coward to,"" indicating a lack of a plan or immediate intent to act on these thoughts. There is no specific plan for suicide detailed. ""Starve myself"" is presented as a hypothetical for weight loss, not a suicide method. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'Behavior' because there's no plan. It is not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct expressions *by the author* of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The mention of suicide is about a hypothetical ""friend,"" not the author's own feelings or thoughts.

    *   Crucially, ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" The author does not express any personal suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts.
    *   The definition of **Indicator** states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" This must be interpreted as lacking explicit expression *by the author about their own suicidal state*, especially in light of the rule about the risk corresponding only to the writer. It further states, ""There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The author shows no personal distress or suicidal thoughts/feelings.
    *   The definition of **Ideation** requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" *by the author*. This is not present.
    *   Since the author is not expressing personal suicidal thoughts, even though the word ""suicide"" is mentioned in a general advisory context, the post falls into the 'Indicator' category for the author's risk. The mention of suicide is not ""very explicit"" *about the author's own state* to move it out of 'Indicator'.

I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations like writing a note or acquiring specific means for suicide are mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Given the lack of a specific method or clear preparation for suicide, this leans towards ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    However, it does not detail a specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. While stopping medication and heavy drinking are concerning behaviors, they are not framed as *the method* for a suicide attempt in the post.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not in terms of acquiring means, but there's a conditional plan (""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that"") linked to the specific method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current thoughts and potential future intentions (""I think its the best option for me,"" ""If I get kicked out... I think I might go and do that"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""drowning yourself... best option for me""). It also mentions a specific method (""drowning yourself,"" ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean""). Furthermore, there's a conditional plan associated with this method (""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that"").
    According to the definitions:
    - **Indicator:** Lacks explicit expression concerning suicide. (Not this, as suicide is explicitly discussed).
    - **Ideation:** Explicit suicidal thoughts but *without* any specific plan. (Not this, because a specific method ""drowning"" is mentioned as an ""option"" and linked to a condition).
    - **Behavior:** Explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan or specific method. The definition states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method..."" ""Drowning"" is a specific method. The conditional statement links this method to a potential future action.
    - **Attempt:** Describes past attempts. (Not this).

    The post clearly includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific method (""drowning""). The conditional statement (""If I get kicked out..."") constitutes a form of planning, even if contingent. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method"". ""Drowning"" is a specific method. Therefore, this falls under 'Behavior'.

452,"Is life actually worth living anymore?. We've been in this pandemic for a year now and very little, if anything, seems to have improved. I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore.

I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses a positive emotion (joy, relief) due to an external event, which is presented as a reason *against* suicide. This implies pre-existing suicidal thoughts.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" is present. This could imply past attempts or a history of considering attempts. However, it does not *describe* a specific past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""a reason not to kill myself"" implies that the thought of killing oneself was present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan identified, so this supports not choosing 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily discusses a current change in feeling (""just gave me a reason"") and its effect on future possibilities (""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The phrase ""suicide attempts"" is mentioned, but no concrete past action or specific attempt is described. The definition of 'Attempt' states ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Attempt'.
    *   ""Star Wars just gave me a reason not to kill myself"" is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts (ideation) that are now being countered.
    *   The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" refers to the concept of attempts. The 'Attempt' category definition requires that ""The content describes past attempts at suicide"" or ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past."" This post does not *describe* a specific past attempt. It mentions ""suicide attempts"" generally as something to be postponed. This could mean postponing future actions that would stem from ideation, or it could allude to a history. However, without a description of a concrete past action, it doesn't meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as strictly defined (""describes past attempts,"" ""concrete action need to have happened""). The focus is on the current ideation being positively impacted. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category as it captures the explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, even if they are now being resisted or postponed.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""no will to live anymore"", ""I just can't take it anymore"", ""just want to end it all"". These are strong indicators of suicidal feelings.

    *   References to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used. However, phrases like ""no will to live anymore"" and ""just want to end it all"" are direct expressions related to ending one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I have absolutely no will to live anymore"" and ""I just want to end it all"" are very direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The expressions here are quite direct about wanting life to end, fitting the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" part of the 'ideation' definition.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan is mentioned, it's not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator**: This category is for posts lacking ""any explicit expression concerning suicide"" or ""direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""no will to live anymore"" and ""want to end it all"" are direct indications of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive. The 'indicator' definition also states, ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" However, the 'ideation' definition includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which is clearly present here.
    *   **Ideation**: This category is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan."" The post contains ""I have absolutely no will to live anymore"" and ""I just want to end it all,"" which are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive. There is no specific plan mentioned. The 'ideation' definition also states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Since a desire to die *is* expressed, this points towards 'ideation'.
    *   **Behavior**: This requires mention of a plan or method, which is absent.
    *   **Attempt**: This requires description of a past attempt, which is absent.

    The phrases ""no will to live anymore"" and ""I just want to end it all"" are strong, explicit expressions of a desire to die, fitting the definition of 'Ideation'. They go beyond ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" or ""vague feeling about dying"" (which would be 'Indicator'). The presence of a clear desire to die, without a plan, aligns with 'Ideation'.

    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""ending it all on new year's eve"" (specific timing). ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"" (preparation - a current suicide note). No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon) is mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""made 3 other suicide notes this year"". This refers to writing notes, not to a physical attempt to end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes, ""suicide notes"". ""Ending it all"" is a very strong euphemism for suicide in this context.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""I'm thinking of ending it all"", ""i can't fucking do another year"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No specific method is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): Yes, ""suicide notes"" are explicitly mentioned as a form of preparation (""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one""). A specific time is also mentioned: ""on new year's eve"".
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". The mention of a current suicide note (""this is the one"") and a specific timeframe (""on new year's eve"") constitutes a plan/preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Primarily current/future intentions (""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"", ""this is the one [suicide note]"", ""i can't fucking do another year"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No. Making suicide notes in the past is not a description of a past attempt (an action taken to die).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""ending it all"") and uses the term ""suicide notes"". This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post describes preparations for suicide: having written suicide notes, with one specific current note (""this is the one""), and a specific timeframe (""on new year's eve""). The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". The presence of a suicide note (a preparation) and a timeline fits this definition.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because it describes current/future intentions and preparations, not a past action taken to end life. Mentioning past suicide notes is not the same as describing a past attempt.

The key elements are ""ending it all on new year's eve"" and ""suicide notes... this is the one."" These indicate a plan and preparation, moving it beyond 'Ideation' into 'Behavior' according to the provided definitions.

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""tried to cut myself last night."" This is a clear instance of self-harm.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post mentions ""during a breakdown,"" ""a very bad night,"" and ""wanted to feel something real,"" indicating significant emotional distress.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The method ""cut myself"" is specified. This refers to an action that has already occurred.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: The entire relevant part of the post (""tried to cut myself last night"") is a reference to a past action of self-harm. It also states, ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before,"" indicating this was a first-time occurrence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The term ""suicide"" or direct synonyms are not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The stated motivation for cutting was ""wanted to feel something real,"" not an explicit desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut myself."" This method was used in a past action.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post describes an action that has already happened (""last night""), not preparation for a future event.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post clearly refers to a past event: ""last night.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""tried to cut myself last night"" is a specific description of a past self-harm action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes a specific act of self-harm (""tried to cut myself"") that occurred in the past (""last night"").
    *   **Indicator** is not appropriate because the post goes beyond general distress; it describes a concrete self-harm action.
    *   **Ideation** is not appropriate because there is no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. The motivation given (""wanted to feel something real"") is common in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) but does not express suicidal intent.
    *   **Behavior** is not appropriate because this category refers to current plans or ongoing self-harm behavior. The post describes a completed past action.
    *   **Attempt** is defined as: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
        *   The post describes a ""concrete action"" (""tried to cut myself"") that ""happened in the past"" (""last night"").
        *   While the post doesn't explicitly state the cutting was a ""suicide attempt"" (and the motivation suggests NSSI), the ""Attempt"" category is for ""historic actions."" Cutting is a significant self-harm action. Given that other categories are not suitable for a *past concrete act of self-harm*, ""Attempt"" is the most fitting category. Even if the intent wasn't explicitly suicidal, reporting a past act of cutting signifies a high level of risk and crisis, aligning with the purpose of the ""Attempt"" category to capture serious past self-injurious actions.

    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""i have nothing and no one, i have no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living.""
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""plan to kill myself"" but does not specify a method, tools, location, or preparations.

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""plan to kill myself"").

    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': While the word ""plan"" is used, the definition of 'behavior' requires ""a specific method or preparations taken"". Since no specific method or preparation is mentioned, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current/future intentions (""plan to kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""plan to kill myself"") and a desire to die (""no purpose to live""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It refers to current/future intentions, not a past event, so it's not 'attempt'.
    *   The key distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'. 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The post says ""plan to kill myself"" but does not provide any specifics about the method, means, location, or timing. The mere mention of having a ""plan"" without detailing any aspect of it falls short of the ""specific method or preparations"" required for 'behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post best, as there's a clear expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but no *specific* plan detailed. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" also supports this.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing yourself soon"" is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The tone is somewhat detached and practical (""Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier""), with an underlying resolve (""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""soon,"" indicating a temporal aspect of a plan. It discusses a preparatory step: whether to inform others (""let folks know""). However, no specific *method* of suicide (tools, location, substances) is mentioned. The preparation (informing others) is being *contemplated*, not stated as definitively decided or acted upon.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - The post discusses the *idea* of a preparatory step (informing people: ""let folks know you'll be killing yourself soon or just surprise em""). ""Soon"" implies imminence. However, it doesn't state that a specific preparation *has been made* (like writing a note or acquiring means as per the examples in the ""Behavior"" definition). The preparation is being questioned/considered.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This is relevant here.

    *   It refers to future intentions, not past actions, so it's not ""Attempt.""
    *   The decision is between ""Ideation"" and ""Behavior.""
    *   ""Ideation"" is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   ""Behavior"" is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...).""
    *   The post expresses a clear intent (""killing yourself soon""). This is a plan in a general sense. However, the ""Behavior"" definition requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"" with concrete examples.
    *   No specific *method* is mentioned.
    *   The ""preparation"" (informing others) is being *contemplated* or questioned (""Is it better to let folks know... or just surprise em""), not stated as a preparation *taken* or decided upon in the way acquiring means or writing a note would be.
    *   While ""soon"" indicates imminence and a decision to act, the lack of a specific method or a concrete preparation *taken* (as per the examples for ""Behavior"") makes it fall short of the ""Behavior"" category's strict requirements.
    *   Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and the ambiguity of whether contemplating informing others counts as ""preparations taken"" in the same vein as the examples, ""Ideation"" is the more appropriate category. It's very strong ideation with a clear intent to act soon, but lacks the specified details for ""Behavior.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself tonight"", ""want to kill myself so bad"", ""hang myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Fuckkkkkkk"", ""so fucking tired of everything"", ""god damn it"" (expressions of extreme distress, anger, exhaustion).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""hang myself"" (method), ""at the woods"" (location), ""tonight"" (timing), ""play my favorite music ever"" (preparation/ritual).
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""hang myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I think I'll kill myself tonight"", ""I want to kill myself so bad"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""at the woods"" (specific location), ""tonight"" (specific time), ""play my favorite music ever"" (part of the planned act). The mention of a specific song ""The End-The doors"" also suggests a degree of planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""tonight"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""kill myself"") and a desire to die. Crucially, it also includes a specific plan: method (""hang myself""), location (""at the woods""), and timing (""tonight""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', which requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions of a plan or method. It is not 'Ideation' because a specific plan is present. It is not 'Attempt' as it refers to a future action. It is not 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned with intent.

1.  CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to kill myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""truly alone forever"", ""struggled daily with loneliness"", ""What a joke"" (implying despair/hopelessness).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching"", ""Already started to cancel friendships"". Setting a date is a plan. Cancelling friendships is a preparation.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I want to kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to kill myself"").

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (like pills, rope, gun) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""already set a date"" is a clear sign of planning/preparation. ""Already started to cancel friendships"" is also a preparatory behavior.

4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I want to kill myself"", ""I'm approaching [the date]"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide (""I want to kill myself""), so it's not 'indicator'.
    *   The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts.
    *   The post also mentions preparations: ""already set a date"" and ""Already started to cancel friendships"". The definition of 'behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Setting a date is a form of explicit planning and a preparation. Cancelling friendships is also a preparation.
    *   While a specific *method* (e.g., pills, weapon) is not detailed, the ""preparations taken"" (setting a date, cancelling friendships) are sufficient to move it beyond 'ideation' into 'behavior'. The definition for 'behavior' includes ""preparations taken"" as a criterion, and setting a date is a significant preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""so i dont kill myself"" - Explicit mention of killing oneself (suicide).
        *   ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"" - Explicit mention and contemplation of suicide and death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:**
        *   ""This life doesnt fit me. It never did"" - Dissatisfaction, alienation.
        *   ""i dont like this shithole i live in but i cant change it"" - Hopelessness, feeling trapped.
        *   The entire tone suggests deep unhappiness and distress. The person states they are doing things they don't like (sleeping all day, wasting time) specifically to avoid killing themselves, indicating a struggle against suicidal impulses.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The post discusses the *idea* of suicide and the struggle against it, but not *how* it might be carried out.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide"").
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. The phrase ""i have to [do things I dislike] so i dont kill myself"" implies a present desire or impulse to kill oneself that the person is actively trying to suppress. Contemplating ""Is suicide really as bad... its just death"" also points to active suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   Since no plan or method is mentioned, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current thoughts and feelings (""i have to so i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really..."").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide.""
    *   The statement ""i have to [sleep all day/waste time] so i dont kill myself"" indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts that the individual is actively fighting against.
    *   The question ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"" is a clear contemplation of suicide.
    *   These are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings.
    *   There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    *   There is no description of a past attempt.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'behavior' because there's no plan. It is not 'attempt' because it's about current thoughts, not past actions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die"" is mentioned twice.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The phrase ""I want to die"" clearly indicates despair and a desire for life to end. ""Too much of a coward to do it"" suggests internal conflict and distress.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. The post states ""simple as that,"" implying the desire is the core message without further details on action.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"" is a very direct expression of wanting to not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While ""suicide"" isn't used, ""I want to die"" is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive, which aligns with the definition of 'ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer""). This is not vague.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no plan or method is mentioned, it is not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings/intentions (""I want to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for posts lacking explicit expression concerning suicide or suicidal thoughts. ""I want to die"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive, making 'indicator' unsuitable.
    *   **Ideation:** This category is for ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan"". The post ""I want to die"" fits this definition perfectly. It expresses a clear desire to die without mentioning a plan.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires mention of a plan or method. No plan or method is mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** This category is for descriptions of past attempts. No past attempt is described.

The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I want to die""), which is an explicit expression of suicidal feelings. There is no mention of a specific plan or method. Therefore, it falls into the 'Ideation' category.

    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""Goodbye"", ""last vent"", ""throw myself off a bridge"", ""suicidal since i was 9"", ""i self-harmed"", ""dying"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""i cant take it"", ""hated myself"", ""tired of everything around me"". Also, ""But now i am at peace, no longer in pain,"" which can be an indicator of a resolved decision to die.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""throw myself off a bridge"" (method and location), ""Ive planned it all out"" (planning), ""locked in the bathroom"" (preparation/isolation).
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""i self-harmed"" is a reference to past self-harming behavior. ""been suicidal since i was 9"" indicates long-term suicidality.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""i self-harmed"" describes a past concrete action. The definition of 'Attempt' states ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)"". Self-harm is a concrete action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicidal"", ""throw myself off a bridge"") and a specific plan/method (""throw myself off a bridge"", ""Ive planned it all out"") along with preparations (""locked in the bathroom""). This strongly aligns with the definition of **Behavior**.

    However, the post also mentions ""i self-harmed"", which qualifies as a description of a past attempt or a concrete past action related to suicide, as per the 'Attempt' definition (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"").
    The 'Attempt' category has a specific rule: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    This post clearly refers to past self-harm (a past action/attempt) and also explicitly mentions current plans to commit suicide.
    Therefore, according to this specific note, the category should be 'Attempt'. The note overrides classifying it solely as 'Behavior' when both conditions (past attempt reference and current plan) are met.

It also describes a specific, albeit unusual, method (""twist my dick off"") and the intended consequence leading to death (""die of blood loss""). This fits the definition of ""Behavior"" as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a mentioned plan/method.

470,Sayonara. My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker. I will eventually die in a much painful way. I endured the physical pain and mental depression for years. I am lonely and have no reason to live,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Sayonara"" (goodbye, often with connotations of finality), ""eventually die in a much painful way"" (referring to disease), ""no reason to live"". No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"" as an act.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""mental depression"", ""lonely"", ""no reason to live"" (implies hopelessness, despair).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (the act of ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself"")? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Sayonara"" combined with ""I am lonely and have no reason to live"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive or seeing no value in continued life. This fits the Ideation definition's criterion: ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   The Indicator definition states: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Conversely, if such a desire *is* expressed, it should be considered for a higher category. ""No reason to live"" is such an expression.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post mentions dying from a disease but no method for suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, beyond the verbal ""Sayonara"".
    *   Since no plan or method is mentioned, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings (""lonely"", ""no reason to live"") and future outlook (""Sayonara"", ""eventually die""). The ""no reason to live"" and ""Sayonara"" point to current ideation about ending life.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains ""Sayonara"" and ""no reason to live."" This combination is an explicit expression of suicidal feelings, specifically a desire to not be alive any longer.
    *   While the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used, the phrase ""no reason to live"" directly communicates a core component of suicidal ideation.
    *   The Ideation definition states it ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". This post fits that.
    *   The Indicator definition states, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Since a desire to not be alive *is* expressed here (""no reason to live""), it should not be 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, so it is not 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

471,"I'm starting to get envious when I hear about people dying/committing suicide successfully. Obviously no one should go through the grief of a loved one dying. I know it is wrong and disgusting to think about yourself when someone is in pain and someone's life. But I just couldn't help but think ""Why can't that be me? Why do I get to carry on living and they get to die?"" and the ever so disappointing question of ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"" to which the answer is always no. This is turning me into a bad person and I need to stop. I won't like start being healthy or chasing serotonin or whatever, I'll just try to be more considerate next time.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""people dying/committing suicide successfully"", ""killing yourself"", ""I'll still be suicidal lol"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Envy towards those who die by suicide (""Why can't that be me?""), disappointment (""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right? to which the answer is always no""), self-deprecation (""This is turning me into a bad person"").
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post questions the difficulty of suicide but doesn't detail any method or plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes (""committing suicide successfully"", ""killing yourself"", ""suicidal lol"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes (""Why can't that be me? Why do I get to carry on living and they get to die?""). The statement ""I'll still be suicidal lol"" also confirms ongoing suicidal feelings.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No. The post discusses the general idea of ""killing yourself"" but not how.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No explicit plan is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current/future intentions (""I'll still be suicidal lol""). The questions ""Why can't that be me?"" and ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"" reflect current thoughts.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
    *   It is not describing a past attempt.

Like at this point I am and have done some bad shit so I'm probably doing there anyways so it shouldn't matter, but I keep worrying about it. The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."". Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff. I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""wants to die"". It also mentions ""keeping me alive"", implying a struggle against the desire to die.
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""afraid"", ""worrying"", ""feeling really isolated"".
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The fear of ""going to hell"" is mentioned as a deterrent, not a plan.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Am I the only one who wants to die"". This is a direct expression of wanting to die.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. While ""suicide"" isn't used, ""wants to die"" is a very direct expression of suicidal feeling. The definition of Ideation includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is mentioned, so it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and desires (""wants to die"", ""keeping me alive"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains a direct expression ""wants to die"". This goes beyond ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" (Indicator definition).
    *   The definition of **Ideation** states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""wants to die"" clearly fits ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it is not **Behavior**.
    *   There is no description of a past attempt, so it is not **Attempt**.
    *   The expression ""wants to die"" is explicit enough to classify as Ideation, as it directly communicates a desire to end one's life, even if the word ""suicide"" itself is not used. The definition of Ideation specifically includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".

The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'.

Strong indicators of hopelessness and despair.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: ""thought of killing myself multiple times"" refers to past suicidal ideation, not a described past attempt where an action was taken.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""thought of killing myself multiple times"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""thought of killing myself"" is a direct expression of (past) suicidal thoughts/desire to die. The current statement ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" combined with ""the only thing keeping me alive"" suggests a current struggle with the will to live.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.

    *   Since there's no explicit planning, it would not be 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past suicidal thoughts (""For the past 2 years... I thought of killing myself multiple times""). However, it also describes a current, worsening situation (""it has been getting much worse"", ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore""). The past ideation is presented in the context of current, severe distress.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past *thoughts* of suicide, not actions taken.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself."" According to the 'Indicator' definition (""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide""), this post cannot be 'Indicator'.
    *   The post includes ""thought of killing myself multiple times,"" which is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts. This fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" Even though these thoughts are described as occurring in the past, they are explicitly mentioned in the content of the post, which is about current severe distress. The current statement ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" suggests that these feelings are highly relevant to the present.
    *   There is no mention of specific plans, methods, or preparations, so it is not 'Behavior'.
    *   The post mentions ""thought of killing myself,"" not a concrete past action or attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""thought of killing myself""). While these specific thoughts are dated to the past, they are part of the narrative explaining the current severe distress and the feeling of ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore."" The definition of 'Ideation' applies because the *content of the post* includes these explicit expressions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""die"" and ""definitely die"".
    *   Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The phrase ""I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die"" indicates strong despair and a determined desire to die.
    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user asks ""Where can I find out how to die,"" which indicates they are seeking a method or plan, but does not state one they have already decided upon.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the intent to ""die"" and ""definitely die"" is clear.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to definitely die"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user is asking *for* information on methods (""Where can I find out how to die""). They are not stating a specific method they intend to use.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Seeking information is a preparatory step, but no concrete preparations (like acquiring means or writing a note) are mentioned.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific plan or method is stated, this rule applies.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current/future intentions (""I just want to definitely die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die, so it is not 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt, so it is not 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'. 'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" 'Behavior' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts *and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide* or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method...""
    *   The user expresses a strong desire to die and is actively seeking information on *how* to die. However, they do not mention a *specific* plan or method they have chosen. Asking ""Where can I find out how to die"" is a step towards forming a plan, but it is not the articulation of an existing plan or method.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without specifying a plan or method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    The post explicitly mentions a past attempt with the phrase ""if I do attempt again.""
    The definition of **Attempt** is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). ... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    The post clearly refers to a past attempt. It also mentions current strong ideation and a future conditional intention (""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out,"" and ""I'm not going to fail""). These future intentions can be considered ""current plans"" in the context of the note for the 'Attempt' category, even if they lack the specificity for 'Behavior'.

3.  PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""Bridge"" implies a method like jumping).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, a specific day (""Monday"") and a location/method (""Bridge"") are mentioned, indicating a plan.
4.  TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions (""on Monday"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5.  CATEGORY REASONING: The post explicitly states an intention to commit suicide (""kill myself""). It also includes a specific plan: a method/location (""Bridge"") and a timeframe (""on Monday""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit suicidal thoughts and a plan, including a specific method or location.

""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms. Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" suggests planning and removing obstacles.
    *   References to past attempts: Not explicitly. ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" might imply past ideation or planning but not a clear past action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kms"").

Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, and distress.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No) - The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No) - Yes. ""I want to die."" is a very direct expression. ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore"" also expresses a profound desire to escape the current state of being, which aligns with not wanting to be alive as oneself.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' - The phrase ""I want to die"" is a clear and explicit expression of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances) - No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means) - No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' - No plan identified.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? - Current feelings and intentions (""I want to die."").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? - No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains the explicit statement ""I want to die."" This is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive any longer.
    The definition of **Ideation** is: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    The post meets the criteria for explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to not be alive (""I want to die."").
    The post does *not* mention any specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not qualify for **Behavior**.
    The post does *not* describe a past attempt, so it does not qualify for **Attempt**.
    The post is not merely general distress without explicit mention of wanting to die; ""I want to die"" is explicit. Therefore, it is not **Indicator**.
    The presence of ""I want to die"" clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator' and into 'Ideation' as no plan is mentioned.

I've been thinking about just getting it over with.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""getting it over with"" is a common euphemism for suicide, indicating thoughts of ending life.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Can't take it anymore"" (overwhelm), ""failed my son"" (guilt, failure), ""worthless as fuck"" (low self-esteem, despair), ""he'll be better off without me"" (hopelessness, feeling like a burden).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""getting it over with"" in this context is a strong and common euphemism for suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" is a direct expression of considering ending one's life. ""he'll be better off without me"" also implies a desire to not be alive, from the perspective of being a burden.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The phrase ""getting it over with"" is a very strong indicator of suicidal thought. The 'Ideation' definition states ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". ""Thinking about just getting it over with"" clearly falls under this as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, even if the word ""suicide"" itself isn't used. The rule for 'Ideation' also states ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"". Here, a desire *is* expressed.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. No plan is mentioned, so it is not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" refers to current thoughts and potential future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness. The phrase ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to end one's life. This moves it beyond 'Indicator' because a desire to die is expressed. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. There is no mention of past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'. Therefore, the post aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""committing suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""desire to die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (exit bag, aspirin, gun, rope/hanging).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes (exit bag set up, purchased pills, purchased gun, purchased rope, went to remote location, turned gas valve).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. It extensively details past attempts and describes a current/very recent situation with an exit bag.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, three distinct past attempts are described with actions taken.
        *   ""At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills."" (Action: took pills)
        *   ""At 21, I purchased a gun... I pulled the trigger, nothing happened."" (Action: purchased gun, aimed, pulled trigger)
        *   ""Just recently, I purchased rope... I got into a remote location and went with the plan."" (Action: purchased rope, set up, attempted hanging)

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post describes multiple past attempts in detail, where concrete actions were taken: taking pills, pulling a trigger on a gun aimed at the head, and attempting partial suspension hanging. These fit the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    The post also describes current plans/preparations/actions: ""Today, I have an exit bag set up. ... When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked.""
    The definition for 'Attempt' includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    Since the post clearly describes multiple past attempts (concrete actions taken) and also mentions current plans/actions (""exit bag set up"", ""turned that gas valve""), the category 'Attempt' is the most appropriate according to the provided rules.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""face death"", ""until i die"", ""if i survived... if not, well, you know what happened"". The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""die"" and ""death"" are explicitly linked to the poster's intended actions.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm done"", ""too pissed"", ""don't even want to feel good anymore"", ""embrace the pain"". These indicate significant distress, anger, and a sense of giving up.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""I'm now gonna start working out until i die or pass out"". This is a specific method. The phrase ""i'll be back in 12 hours if i survived to tell you how it went, if not, well, you know what happened"" acts as a form of note and indicates a timeline for the planned action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No):** No, the word ""suicide"" itself is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No):** Yes. ""face death"" and ""working out until i die"" are direct expressions of wanting to die or an intention to cause one's own death.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** While ""suicide"" isn't used, the intent to die (""until I die"") is explicit. The definition of Ideation includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". This post clearly expresses that. So, it's beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances):** Yes, the method is ""working out until i die or pass out"". This is a specific action intended to lead to death.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means):** The post itself, with the statement ""if not, well, you know what happened,"" can be seen as a form of suicide note. The statement ""I'm now gonna start"" indicates immediate preparation or commencement of the action.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** The plan ""working out until I die"" is quite specific in terms of the action to be taken to achieve death. It's not a vague wish.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?:** Current and immediate future intentions. ""I'm *now* gonna start..."" and the 12-hour timeframe.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?:** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is not an 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die (""until I die"", ""face death"").

    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.

        *   A statement that functions like a suicide note (""if not, well, you know what happened"").

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method, tools, location, or immediate preparations for suicide are mentioned. The ""plan"" is about the timing (""maybe in my 20's or 30's"") and wanting to ""experience a few more things before I do,"" not the act of suicide itself.

    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific substance (""duloxetine pills"") is mentioned as a method. Preparation is indicated by ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.""
    *   Check for references to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used directly by the poster about themselves. However, ""kill you"" is used in reference to the drug's potential.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): No direct statement like ""I want to die."" However, the inquiry about a drug's lethal potential combined with saving it ""for later"" strongly implies suicidal intent.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The phrasing ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" is an inquiry, but coupled with ""saving for later,"" it moves beyond general distress. The focus is on a specific means of causing death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): Yes, ""duloxetine pills"" (a specific substance/medication).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): Yes, ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" indicates acquiring and reserving the means.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The plan here (specific drug, saving it) seems explicit enough to be considered.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: ""saving for later"" clearly indicates current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post asks about the lethality of a specific drug (""Can duloxetine kill you?"") and states that the poster is saving these pills (""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later."").
    This combination indicates:
    *   **Suicidal thought:** The inquiry about lethality in the context of saving the pills strongly implies suicidal ideation.
    *   **Specific method:** ""Duloxetine pills"" are a specific method.
    *   **Preparation:** ""Saving for later"" is a form of preparation.

    The 'Indicator' category is for posts lacking explicit expression concerning suicide or only vague feelings about death. This post is more specific, focusing on a lethal method.
    The 'Ideation' category is for explicit suicidal thoughts *without* a specific plan. This post includes a specific method (pills) and preparation (saving them). The 'Ideation' definition also states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    The 'Behavior' category definition is: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs...).""
    The question about lethality combined with saving the pills can be considered an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts"" (thoughts about how to commit suicide). The plan involves a specific method (duloxetine pills) and preparation (saving them). This fits the 'Behavior' definition.
    The post does not describe a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

    The combination of inquiring about a specific lethal method and stating that the means are being hoarded points to 'Behavior' because it involves suicidal thought coupled with a plan and preparation.

If anyone or anything truely cared about my life I know it isn't me. Not anymore. I feel so empire. So out of place with everyone I'm around. I just want to end but haven't yet.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just want to end"" is a clear expression of wanting life to cease, which is a suicidal thought.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I really need to stop feeling this way,"" ""It's hell,"" ""If anyone or anything truely cared about my life I know it isn't me. Not anymore,"" ""I feel so empire [likely typo for empty/despair]. So out of place."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of isolation.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: ""haven't yet"" implies no past attempt is being described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes, ""I just want to end"" is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""I just want to end"" is a fairly explicit expression of a desire for life to cease. The definition of 'ideation' includes ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". This phrase fits that definition.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? (tools, locations, substances): No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? (notes, acquiring means): No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as no plan is hinted.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?: Current feelings and intentions (""I just want to end but haven't yet"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described?: No, ""haven't yet"" indicates no past attempt is being described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses significant emotional distress and hopelessness. Crucially, it contains the phrase ""I just want to end,"" which is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive any longer.
    - It is not 'indicator' because 'indicator' ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide"" or involves only ""vague feeling about dying or death"". ""I just want to end"" is an explicit expression of a desire to die, which goes beyond a vague feeling or general dissatisfaction.
    - It fits 'ideation' because 'ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan"". The post has this desire (""I just want to end"") but no specific plan.
    - It is not 'behavior' because there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparations.
    - It is not 'attempt' because it refers to current feelings (""I just want to end but haven't yet"") and does not describe a past action.

    The key is that ""I just want to end"" is considered an ""explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" even if the word ""suicide"" itself is not used.

489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""could be dead by the end of the day today"", ""off myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied hopelessness (""Why has it taken so long?""), fatigue, procrastination.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions ""buy the gas"" as a potential means. The person states they *haven't* bought the gas due to fatigue/procrastination, but the method is identified.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""off myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""could be dead by the end of the day today"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""gas"" is mentioned as something to be bought to ""off myself"". This implies a method (e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post indicates a lack of current preparation (""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas""), but the thought of acquiring the means (""buy the gas"") is present. The method itself is identified.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and wanting to die, so it's not 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond just expressing a desire to die by mentioning a specific means (""gas"") that would be used to ""off myself"". The thought process includes a method, even if the person states they haven't acted on acquiring the means yet.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ... lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons ... suitable to end ones life...)."" ""Gas"" in this context is a substance/tool suitable for suicide. The plan is to ""off myself"" using ""gas"" which needs to be ""bought"".
    *   While the preparation (buying the gas) hasn't happened, the identification of a specific method (""gas"") linked to the suicidal intent (""off myself"") pushes this into the 'behavior' category. It's not just ""I want to die,"" but ""I could die today if I used gas, but I haven't bought it.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned. ""do it"" in the context of ""I post about suicide constantly, I should just suck it up and do it already"" clearly refers to committing suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: Frustration, self-deprecation (""stop being a pussy""), a sense of obligation or pressure to act on suicidal thoughts (""I should just suck it up and do it already"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. ""do it"" is a general statement of intent, not a specific plan.
    *   References to past attempts: No direct mention of past *attempts*. ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to past expressions of suicidal thoughts, not actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" is a direct expression of wanting to act on suicidal thoughts, implying a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" refer to current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide.""
    *   It expresses a clear desire or intention to ""do it"" (commit suicide).
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    *   It's not describing a past attempt.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" strongly indicates a desire to end one's life.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
        *   ""started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself)."" - Explicit mention of self-harm.
        *   ""planned to kill myself in the forest in January."" - Explicit mention of a past suicide plan.
        *   ""now it time to stop the lie and end it."" - Expression of intent to die.
        *   ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" - Explicit current suicide plan with method.
    *   Emotional indicators:
        *   ""I couldn't keep up"", ""stop taking care of my hygiene"", ""nervous tics came back stronger"". - Distress.
        *   ""I was done with everything."" - Hopelessness, resignation.
        *   ""I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time."" - Complex emotional state, the ""happy"" can be a sign of resolved decision to die.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Current plan: ""hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" (Method: hanging, cutting finger; Location: highest tree of the forest).
        *   Preparations: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car."" (Means acquired).
    *   References to past attempts:
        *   ""During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down"" - This is self-harm. It's not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt.
        *   ""planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't"" - This is a past plan that was not acted upon, so not an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""plan to hang myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""end it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""hang myself"", ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. Past self-harm and past planning. Current/future specific plan and intent.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. Past self-harm (""cut my rights leg"") is described as a coping mechanism (""to calm me down""). A past plan (""planned to kill myself... But I didn't"") is mentioned, explicitly stating it was not carried out. The definition of 'Attempt' requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die.
    *   It details a specific current plan: method (hanging, cutting finger with axe), location (forest tree), and means (""rope, the axe and the car"" are ""ready"").
    *   It mentions past self-harm (""cut my rights leg"").
    *   It mentions a past plan that was *not* carried out (""planned to kill myself... But I didn't""), so this is not a past attempt.
    *   **Indicator** is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation** is incorrect because there is a specific plan and preparations.
    *   **Attempt** is incorrect because while there's past self-harm and past planning, no concrete past suicide attempt (an action taken with intent to die that failed) is described. The past plan was explicitly not acted upon.
    *   **Behavior** fits best. The definition states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken..."" The post meets all these criteria: explicit suicidal thoughts, a detailed plan, preparations, and past self-harm.

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""die anyway"" (philosophical context), ""don't really want to die"". No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""What's the point of living""), existential dread (""no point for us being here""), regret of existence (""I wish I was never born"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post says ""I wish I was never born,"" which could imply not wanting to be alive. However, it immediately follows with ""but at the same time don't really want to die."" This explicitly negates a current desire to die. The rule states: ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given the explicit statement ""don't really want to die,"" and no mention of ""suicide,"" this leans towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   This step is not highly relevant as the previous step points away from 'ideation' or 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current philosophical musings and feelings.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post expresses significant existential distress and a wish to not have been born.
    *   However, ""suicide"" is not explicitly mentioned.
    *   Crucially, the person states ""don't really want to die,"" which directly contradicts a current desire to end their life.
    *   There are no plans, methods, or mentions of past attempts.
    *   The 'indicator' definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits this description due to the general dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and lack of explicit suicide mention or clear desire to die (which is, in fact, negated).
    *   The 'ideation' definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" While ""wish I was never born"" is close, the subsequent ""don't really want to die"" negates the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" in the present context. The rule ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" applies here.

Based on the explicit negation of wanting to die and the absence of any mention of suicide, the post falls into the 'indicator' category, reflecting general distress and hopelessness without active suicidal ideation.

5.  CATEGORY REASONING:
    The post shows clear signs of emotional distress, shame, and social anxiety. However, there are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, plans, or past attempts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself"" is explicitly mentioned.

    *   Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? (Yes/No): Yes, ""kill yourself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No): Yes. The post questions why families ""dont let you kill yourself"" when ""you suddenly get sick of it"" and asks ""why do you want me to suffer"".

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself."" It expresses frustration about being prevented from doing so and questions why one should continue to suffer. This indicates suicidal thoughts or feelings and a desire for life to end, or at least for the suffering to end via suicide. There is no mention of a specific plan or method. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.
    - It is not 'Indicator' because suicide (""kill yourself"") is explicitly mentioned.
    - It is 'Ideation' because it expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill yourself,"" frustration at not being allowed to) without a specific plan.
    - It is not 'Behavior' because no plan or method is mentioned.
    - It is not 'Attempt' as it doesn't describe a past action.

    *   Fits 'Ideation' because there are ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   Not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a ""specific method or preparations taken.""
    *   Not 'Attempt' because it doesn't describe a past attempt.
    The phrase ""pls fucking end me before the day"" is a clear expression of wanting to die. The context ""nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it"" reinforces the suicidal nature of the thoughts. Since no plan or method is mentioned, it falls into 'Ideation'.

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next"" (implies wanting to die via stabbing). ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned. ""wouldn't have to bring shame... with a suicide"" implies suicide is a considered option.
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied distress, desire to die, concern about bringing ""shame"" to the family via suicide.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""stabbings"" as a desired way to die, but this is a wish to be a victim, not a plan for self-action. ""Suicide"" is mentioned as an alternative being contemplated. No specific *suicide* method or preparation is detailed by the poster for themselves.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I hope it'll be me next"" in the context of fatal stabbings). The contemplation of suicide as an alternative also points to a desire to die or strong suicidal thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""Stabbings"" are mentioned as a desired way to die, but this is not a plan for the user to *commit* suicide. ""Suicide"" is mentioned generally, but no specific method for committing suicide is outlined by the user.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The user is not detailing a plan to *commit* suicide. They are expressing a wish to die by external means (being stabbed) as an alternative to suicide to avoid shame. This does not constitute a plan for suicide under the 'Behavior' definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I hope it'll be me next"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide.""
    *   There is a clear expression of wanting to die (""I hope it'll be me next"" [stabbing]).
    *   The user is contemplating suicide as an option, as evidenced by the phrase ""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family with a suicide."" This clearly indicates suicidal thoughts.
    *   However, there is no specific plan detailed for *committing* suicide. The desire to be a victim of a stabbing is not a plan for self-inflicted suicide.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'Indicator' is not suitable because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a desire to die is expressed.
        *   'Behavior' requires an explicit plan to *commit* suicide or self-harming behavior. Hoping to be a victim of an external event is not a plan to commit suicide.
        *   'Attempt' is not suitable as it refers to past actions.
        *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits the post well. The user expresses a desire to die and explicitly mentions suicide and suicidal thoughts, but lacks a specific plan to carry out suicide themselves.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killmyself"", ""put an end to it all"", ""kill myself with peace"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, social isolation (""0 friends"", ""0 social life""), lack of purpose (""no skills no job no money""), desire to end suffering (""want to put an end to it all"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post discusses a plan to ""disappear,"" possibly by going to ""another country,"" getting ""another identinty,"" so they can ""kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it."" This is a plan for the circumstances surrounding the suicide, rather than a specific method of suicide itself.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""killmyself"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""want to put an end to it all"", ""killmyself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon, specific location like a bridge) for committing suicide is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post outlines a conceptual plan involving significant life changes (disappearing, new country, new identity) as preparatory steps to enable the suicide under desired conditions (peace, anonymity). However, these are not preparations of the *means* of suicide (like acquiring tools or writing a note) as exemplified in the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The plan is about creating circumstances for suicide, not the method of suicide itself. The 'Behavior' definition emphasizes ""specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from...))"". The plan described does not fit these examples of methods or direct preparations for the act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and future intentions (""i want to put an end to it all"", ""how can i just disappear? ... so i can just kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   The decision is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   'Behavior' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...).""
    *   The post does contain a ""plan"" in a general sense (disappearing to another country to commit suicide). However, it does not specify a *method* of suicide. The ""preparations"" mentioned (going to another country, new identity) are to create a context for the suicide, not direct preparations of the means or method as exemplified in the 'Behavior' definition (like acquiring pills or a weapon, or identifying a specific lethal location).
    *   Given the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" and since the plan lacks a specific method or preparations directly related to the means of suicide as per the examples for 'Behavior', 'Ideation' is the more appropriate category. The plan is significant but focuses on the circumstances rather than the act itself.

But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""tried to kill myself"", ""ALMOST KILL MYSELF"", ""ALMOST FUCKING DIED"", ""wanted to [die]"", ""killing theirselves"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Strong distress, frustration (""FUCKING BREATHE. WHY!""), desperation (""THIS NEEDS TO END!""), hopelessness (""Unfortunately, I'm still alive"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
        *   Past attempt: ""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets"".
        *   Future intention: ""gonna try again tonight"" (implies the same method). ""another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful."" (Plan B is mentioned, though not detailed).
    *   References to past attempts: ""I tried to kill myself last night"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""tried to kill myself"", ""killing theirselves"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Unfortunately, I'm still alive"", ""I FUCKING WANTED TO [die] AS WELL!"", ""THIS NEEDS TO END!"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. For the past attempt, ""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag"". For the immediate future, ""gonna try again tonight"" implies the same method. A ""Plan B"" is mentioned, though its specifics are not detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The past attempt involved a specific method, implying preparation. The statement ""gonna try again tonight"" and having a ""Plan B"" indicates ongoing planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both.
        *   Past: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation...""
        *   Current/future: ""I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the method of the attempt ""last night"" is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets"". This clearly fits the definition of 'Attempt' which states, ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    The post also mentions current plans: ""I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind.""
    The definition for 'Attempt' includes a specific instruction: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    Since the post describes a past attempt (""I tried to kill myself last night..."") and also mentions current plans (""I'm gonna try again tonight...""), according to this rule, the classification should be 'Attempt'.
