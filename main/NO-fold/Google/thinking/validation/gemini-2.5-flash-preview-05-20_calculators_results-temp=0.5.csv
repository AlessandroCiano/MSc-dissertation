0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""ending my life again"", ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""Never will find love"", ""mental breakdown"", ""everything in my life is crap even me"", ""I wish I was even attractive enough for someone"", ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""go to a bridge and jump off."" This specifies a method (jumping) and a location (a bridge).
   - References to past attempts: ""ending my life again"" implies a past recurrence of suicidal thoughts or perhaps an attempt, but the wording ""thinking about ending my life again"" leans more towards recurring ideation rather than a concrete past attempt. The definition of 'attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" in the past.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""ending my life"", ""jump off"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""ending my life"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""go to a bridge and jump off."" This is a clear, specific method and location.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The desire to ""go to a bridge"" indicates an intention to act on the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" refers to current thoughts, possibly recurring. ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" refers to a current/future intention and plan. The ""again"" refers to the recurrence of the *thought* or *desire*, not necessarily a past *action* (attempt).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""ending my life""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The post includes a specific plan: ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off."" This includes a specific method (jumping) and a specific location (a bridge).
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'Ideation' is for explicit suicidal thoughts *without* a specific plan. This post *has* a specific plan.
     - 'Behavior' is for explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan, method, or preparations, including suitable locations like bridges. This fits perfectly.
     - 'Attempt' is for describing *past concrete actions*. While ""again"" hints at past thoughts, it does not explicitly state a past *concrete action* (e.g., ""I tried to overdose last week""). The primary focus is on the current suicidal ideation with a specific plan. If the post had clearly stated a past attempt (e.g., ""After my last failed attempt, I'm thinking about a bridge""), then 'Attempt' would be chosen. However, ""thinking about ending my life again"" suggests recurring ideation, not necessarily a past concrete attempt. The most prominent and definitive element is the *current specific plan*.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to die soon"" - a statement about impending death.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I'm inconsolable"" - indicates extreme distress, hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" or ""end my life"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" expresses an expectation or belief of impending death, which, combined with ""inconsolable,"" strongly implies a desire to not be alive. However, the rules state: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'."" and ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" is a statement about dying, not explicitly about *suicide* or *self-inflicted* death. It could be interpreted as a passive statement of hopelessness leading to death, rather than an active desire to cause death. Given the strictness required for 'Ideation' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings) and the ""when in doubt"" rule, this leans towards 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention (""I'm going to die soon"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress (""inconsolable"") and a statement about impending death (""I'm going to die soon"").
    *   However, it does not explicitly use the word ""suicide"" or a direct equivalent like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life.""
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' explicitly states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'."" and ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   While concerning, ""I'm going to die soon"" is a statement about dying, not an explicit statement of suicidal intent or a desire to *cause* death, as strictly defined for 'Ideation'. Therefore, it falls under 'Indicator' due to the lack of explicit suicidal phrasing.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""dying,"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I hate living,"" ""sometime i think about why i have to live"" indicate strong distress, hopelessness, and existential despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I hate living"" expresses a strong desire *not* to live, but it does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" The 'Indicator' definition states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given this strict rule, ""I hate living"" falls under ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness"" rather than an explicit suicidal thought.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings and ongoing thoughts (""I hate living,"" ""sometime i think""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound dissatisfaction with life and a questioning of existence (""I hate living,"" ""why i have to live until now"").
    *   However, it lacks any explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""killing myself,"" or a direct desire to die. The instructions for 'Indicator' are very strict: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   While ""I hate living"" conveys a strong negative sentiment about existence, it does not cross the threshold of explicit suicidal ideation as defined, especially with the instruction to lean towards 'indicator' when in doubt about explicitness.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is a direct explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The plea ""Help me"" indicates distress and a serious intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal"" explicitly mentions a specific method (lethal medication/drugs) and a clear step towards acquiring the means, which constitutes preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Help me kill myself.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""barbiturates/Nembutal"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the request to ""help me find"" them is a clear sign of actively seeking means, which is a form of preparation for a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""Help me kill myself"", ""help me find""). No past events are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because there is not just a desire to die, but also a specific method mentioned and a request for help in acquiring it, which constitutes a plan/preparation.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because it describes current intentions and planning, not a past action.
   - 'Behavior' fits perfectly as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""Help me kill myself"") and mentions a specific plan/method (""find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal"") and preparation (seeking to acquire them).

I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly asks ""Is there a painless way to die"" and states ""I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" These are direct expressions of a desire to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm struggling,"" ""unmotivated,"" ""selfish,"" ""The world scares me,"" ""fear intimacy and feel worthless,"" ""I'm tired."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user is *asking* about a ""painless way to die"" and states ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain."" This indicates a search for a method, but not the mention of a specific method or any preparations being made.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** While the word ""suicide"" is not used, phrases like ""painless way to die"" and ""how to die with certainty and without pain"" are very explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life. Yes.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""Is there a painless way to die,"" and ""I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.""

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die, not just general distress.

The user is asking for a method, not stating one they have.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because no specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The user is asking for information about methods, not stating a concrete plan. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post repeatedly questions ""whats the point of living"", states ""none of it will matter when you're dead"", explicitly says ""want to kill myself"", ""want to die"", ""constantly thinking about how nothing matters after you die and how life doesnt really matter"", ""still have this feeling that i should do it anyways"", and asks ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"".

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it,"" ""I want it to stop,"" ""I need peace."" These phrases strongly imply a desire to end one's life or current existence. The phrase ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" indicates extreme distress and a potential desire for self-harm, but not a specific suicide method.
   - Emotional indicators: ""so much mental pain,"" ""I can't handle it,"" ""I hate everything."" These show severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., ""I'm going to jump,"" ""I'm taking pills"") or preparations (e.g., ""I wrote a note"") are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct expressions of wanting to end one's life: ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it."" These are explicit expressions of not wanting to be alive.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, as noted above.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight"" clearly indicate current and immediate future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life/not be alive.
   - Fits 'Ideation' because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (desire to not be alive, wanting it to be over) but no specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself"" (explicit mention of suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: ""so tiring"", ""tired and lonely"", ""mind is against you"". These indicate significant distress, mental fatigue, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post explicitly states ""but I don't actually want to.""
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The *thought* of wanting to die/kill oneself is explicitly mentioned as something the brain is telling the person, even if the person states they don't *actually* want to. This still constitutes an explicit suicidal thought.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no uncertainty; no plan is mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The post explicitly states the person doesn't *want* to.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits best. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself""), but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The internal struggle with these thoughts aligns with ideation.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (like having the knife or opioids), but the mention of *finding* a dealer or *running towards* a cop implies a potential immediate action or active consideration of means. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" and ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method"". The methods listed are specific enough.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions.
   - Not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
   - It clearly expresses suicidal thoughts, which would put it in 'Ideation'. However, the post goes beyond just thoughts by explicitly mentioning specific methods (""run towards a cop with a knife"", ""find a dealer with some opioids""). The definition of 'Behavior' states, ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method."" The methods mentioned fit this criterion. While the user states ""I don't know, I wouldn't know,"" this uncertainty is about *which* method to choose, not about the existence of a plan itself. The consideration of specific methods pushes it into 'Behavior'.

    *   It goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death, explicitly indicating a desire to end life, so it is not 'Indicator'.
    *   Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

11,"When I encounter new people, in person or online. I always think to myself ""when will they leave?"". Such a fucked up way to feel about a person I barely even know but in my experience no one sticks around. everyone leaves you eventually. Especially the ones who promised they would stay. I start reflecting thinking hmm maybe it's me?. But then I realize I push people away unintentionally because I already have the mind frame of they will leave so it's more like ""let's get this over with"". and the ones who are reluctant to stay I don't necessarily give them a reason to. so shucks, I'd leave too. I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""dying."" The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is metaphorical, expressing a desire to escape one's own painful patterns/feelings, not a direct wish for death or self-harm.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""fucked up way to feel,"" ""no one sticks around,"" ""everyone leaves you eventually,"" ""it still hurts."" These indicate deep emotional pain, loneliness, feelings of abandonment, and self-blame.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is metaphorical for wanting to escape one's current state or self, not a direct desire for non-existence.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The post expresses significant distress but does not explicitly mention suicide or a direct desire to die. Therefore, it leans towards 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and ongoing patterns in relationships (""I always think,"" ""I push people away""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses emotional distress, loneliness, and self-blame. However, it *lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide*. There is no direct mention of wanting to die, ending one's life, or suicidal thoughts. The definition of 'indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits that description perfectly.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i plan to kill myself at 21"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i am not ok,"" ""severely codependent,"" ""constant anxiety, self doubt, and mistrust,"" ""no hope,"" ""this is hell,"" ""anhedonic and dissoative."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""i plan to kill myself at 21."" This is a temporal plan (a specific future age/time), but it does not specify a method (e.g., overdose, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i plan to kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i plan to kill myself"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations (e.g., suicide note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The ""at 21"" is a future intention/temporal plan, not a method or preparation as defined for 'behavior'.
   - The definition for 'behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" Since no method or preparation is specified, despite the temporal plan, it does not meet the strict criteria for 'behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" is relevant here as the plan is temporal but lacks method/preparation specificity.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes current feelings of distress and a future intention (""i plan to kill myself at 21"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no mention of past attempts.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because, while there is a stated intention/plan (""i plan to kill myself at 21""), it lacks the specific method or preparation details required by the 'behavior' definition (e.g., ""lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons,"" ""suitable locations""). The plan is temporal, not methodological or preparatory.
   - 'Ideation' fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""i plan to kill myself"") but without the specific details of *how* (method/preparations) that would categorize it as 'behavior'. The ""at 21"" indicates a strong, fixed desire to end life, which aligns with strong ideation.

   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't like anything about myself,"" ""I also hate my job and my family,"" ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence,"" ""Nobody is getting anything out of this,"" ""sick and tried of crying myself to sleep every night."" These show severe distress, hopelessness, and isolation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with expressions of hopelessness, despair, frustration, self-doubt, and overwhelm: ""really bothers me,"" ""don't know what I'm going to do,"" ""hate,"" ""struggle,"" ""can't seem to do that,"" ""cry very easily,"" ""stuck in this rat race,"" ""not smart enough,"" ""memory is so shit,"" ""no interest in doing anything,"" ""feel so empty,"" ""feel like things are just crushing,"" ""getting harder and harder,"" ""overwhelming,"" ""really scared.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method, ""hanging,"" is mentioned. However, this is immediately qualified by ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" and ""I don't have the guts."" There are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, the mention of ""hanging"" is immediately followed by ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" and ""I don't have the guts."" This indicates a *consideration* of a method, but a clear lack of current intent or ability to execute a plan. The definition for 'behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide."" The post explicitly states the inability to go through with it, negating the presence of a concrete plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""I feel like the only way out is suicide,"" ""I've considered hanging"").

    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. Suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past attempts are described.
    *   **Behavior:** While a method (""hanging"") is mentioned, the crucial phrases ""but I can't seem to go through with it"" and ""I don't have the guts"" indicate a *lack* of a concrete plan or intent to act on that method. The definition for 'behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide."" The post describes ideation *about* a method, not a plan. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""I feel like the only way out is suicide,"" ""I think I should just make my escape"").

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i'm going to kill myself"", ""suicidal notes""
   - Emotional indicators: ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"" (indicates despair and hopelessness about continuing life)
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" (this is a clear preparation).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i'm going to kill myself"" and ""suicidal notes"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i'm going to kill myself"" and ""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific method, but a clear sign of preparation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""i already got my suicidal notes ready"" is explicitly listed as an example of preparation in the 'Behavior' definition.

   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post includes more than just thoughts; it mentions a concrete preparation (""suicidal notes ready""). The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While ""suicidal notes"" isn't a method, it is a preparation explicitly listed under 'Behavior'.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because it describes future intent and preparation, not a past concrete action.
   - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""i'm going to kill myself"") and clearly mentions a preparation (""i already got my suicidal notes ready""), which directly aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' (""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

   - Emotional indicators: ""sick of,"" ""tired of,"" ""ugly and horrible,"" ""hate everything about myself,"" ""disgusting."" These indicate severe distress, self-loathing, and hopelessness regarding appearance.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The desire is ""to be someone else,"" not to end life.
   - References to past attempts: None. The past actions described (dying hair, makeup, new clothes, eating habits) are attempts to change appearance, not self-harm or suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""i just wish i could press a button and be someone else"" expresses a desire for radical change or escape from current self, but not explicitly a desire to die or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and ongoing struggles (""im sick of,"" ""i'm tired of,"" ""i feel,"" ""i hate""). It mentions past actions taken to change appearance, but these are not related to suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses profound distress, self-hatred, and a desire to escape one's current self (""I just want to be someone else""). However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The crucial rule here is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
   - The poster is discussing the topic of suicide and the motivations of others who post about it. They are not expressing any suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts for themselves.
   - Therefore, the post lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide from the *person writing it*. It falls under the definition of 'indicator' because there is no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings *from the poster*.

21,"Help, very worried. I don't know where else to put this but i'm fucking horrified and keep crying and having panic attacks over thinking I have diabetes because I have some of the symptoms. This is also causing me to worry that maybe the diy HRT i'm doing (mtf) is a cause. I can't live without estrogen, i can't wait until i'm a legal adult. Then I think about how many fucking issues I already have and its just too much. I'm going insane what the fuck do I do? My parents would rub in my face about how they were right about me not eating causing me severe issues later on, I'm also scared of being seen weak around them. Please I'm so fucking scared.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mentions of these terms.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""very worried,"" ""fucking horrified,"" ""keep crying,"" ""having panic attacks,"" ""can't live without estrogen,"" ""too much,"" ""I'm going insane,"" ""so fucking scared."" These indicate significant distress, anxiety, hopelessness about specific life situations, and feeling overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" expresses extreme distress and a perceived inability to cope with a specific life circumstance (not having estrogen). However, it is not a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive in a suicidal context. It signifies that life would be unbearable or impossible *under certain conditions*, rather than a desire to end life itself. The overall tone is one of panic and fear about health and parental judgment, not a desire for self-harm or death.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. It is unclear if ""can't live without estrogen"" constitutes explicit suicidal ideation. It's more a statement of extreme dependency and distress.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to current distress and future worries (e.g., ""can't wait until I'm a legal adult""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys intense emotional distress, anxiety, and a feeling of being overwhelmed by life's problems.
    *   However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or ending one's life. The statement ""I can't live without estrogen"" is a strong expression of how vital something is to the person's sense of self and well-being, implying extreme difficulty or impossibility of continuing life *without that specific thing*, but it does not directly state a desire for death or suicide.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   **Indicator:** ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
        *   **Ideation:** Requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    *   Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire to die, despite the high level of distress, the post best fits the 'Indicator' category.

22,There is NO hope left. I've been on medication after medication. I've done biofeedback. I went to therapy twice a week for 4 years. I did EMDR. I had 27 sessions of TMS that did NOTHING. There is no way I can afford Ketamine. I live on $786 a month and some days don't even eat. So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more. Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""Now it's time to end it"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life. The repeated ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" clearly indicates past attempts to end their life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""NO hope left,"" ""did NOTHING,"" ""can't afford,"" ""don't even eat"" convey extreme hopelessness, despair, and distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific *current* plan or method is mentioned for the ""Now it's time to end it"" part.
   - References to past attempts: Explicitly stated: ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""end it"" is a very explicit and direct expression of wanting to end one's life in this context.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Now it's time to end it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *current* methods are mentioned for the current intention.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned for the current intention.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post refers to both past events (""So I tried. And I tried again..."") and current/future intentions (""Now it's time to end it."").
   - Past attempts are specifically described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and past attempts.
   - 'Ideation' describes explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. The post *does* have current ideation (""Now it's time to end it"").
   - 'Behavior' requires an explicit plan or self-harming behavior *currently*. While there's current ideation, there's no specific plan detailed for it.
   - 'Attempt' describes past attempts. The post clearly states ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" This fits the definition of past attempts. The definition for 'Attempt' also includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The phrase ""Now it's time to end it"" can be interpreted as a current intention or ""plan"" in the broader sense, especially when combined with the explicit past attempts. Therefore, the presence of both past attempts and current suicidal ideation/intention places it firmly in the 'Attempt' category according to the specific rule provided.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""Society doesn't like me,"" ""People bully me,"" ""don't feel comfortable,"" ""something is wrong with me,"" ""nothing fills the hole in my heart,"" ""I feel lonely,"" ""I feel like I am only watching other living human beings,"" ""I feel like I am on the moon,"" ""I am very unconnocted with this world,"" ""I feel like a creature."" (Indicates significant distress, hopelessness, isolation, and self-worth issues).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: The post does not describe any past suicide attempts. The phrase ""In the pas I tried to hide this with saying 'I am misanthrope'"" refers to hiding feelings, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the constant thinking about suicide clearly indicates a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" refers to current and ongoing thoughts and intentions. There is no description of a past *attempt*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""thinking about suicide everyday"").
   - It does *not* mention any specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide.
   - It does *not* describe a past suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of ""Ideation"": ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I've given up in life"", ""I'm not scared to die"", ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" These phrases strongly indicate suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""What's the use"", ""given up in life"", ""no hell so I'm not scared to die"", ""For some life may end up getting better but for me it doesn't."" (hopelessness, despair, resignation).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" This explicitly states a plan, a preparatory action (writing a note), and a specific timeframe.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm not scared to die"", ""I've given up in life"", and the overall context strongly convey a desire to end life. The phrase ""I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family"" implies a personal desire *not* to live.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? A specific *method* (e.g., ""pills"", ""gun"") is not mentioned, but a ""plan"" is explicitly stated.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""note"" is explicitly mentioned, which is listed as an example of ""preparations taken"" in the 'behavior' definition. A ""date"" is also set, indicating concrete planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April"" clearly refers to a future intention. Past life difficulties are mentioned as context for the current state.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die and a clear plan/preparation.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there are explicit suicidal thoughts, the post goes beyond mere thoughts by stating ""I have a plan, note and date."" The 'ideation' definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" Even without a specific *method*, the explicit mention of ""plan"" and ""note"" (a preparation) moves it into 'behavior'.
    *   **Behavior:** This is the best fit. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm not scared to die"", ""given up in life"") and explicitly mentions ""a plan to commit suicide"" (""I have a plan, note and date""). The mention of ""note"" directly aligns with ""preparations taken"" as described in the 'behavior' definition.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as the content describes future intent, not a past action.

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently."" (Explicit mention of suicidal thoughts)
        *   ""given how many cuts I have all over myself."" (Explicit mention of self-harm)
        *   ""I'm going to kill myself"" (Explicit desire to die by suicide)
        *   ""or I actually do go through with it and kill myself."" (Explicit desire to die by suicide)
        *   ""I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day"" (Vague mention of death)
        *   ""this will probably be my last post ever."" (Strong implication of ending life)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""hopefully forever"" in institution, ""no one would care or miss me"", ""I don't care. If it happens it happens.""), despair, extreme anger, feeling trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet."" This indicates no specific plan or preparation for suicide has been made. The choice is between seeking help (hospital) or ""go through with it and kill myself"" without specifying *how*.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The cuts are mentioned as self-harm, but not explicitly as a past *suicide attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""kill myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes: ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""kill myself.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., gun, overdose, jumping) for suicide is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The user explicitly states ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet.""
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions (""I plan on going,"" ""I'm still debating,"" ""this will probably be my last post"").
    *   Past events: ""given how many cuts I have all over myself"" refers to past/ongoing self-harm, but not a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits well. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""kill myself""). It clearly states ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"" by saying ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet.""
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for suicide. The choice is presented as an internal debate.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the post describes current intentions and self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt*.

Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""can't kill myself"", ""suicidal"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Im so tired"", ""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point"", ""i dont believe it, maybe its my brain playing with me"" - indicating hopelessness, despair, worthlessness, mental distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"". This identifies a specific location (cliff) and implies a method (jumping). The phrase ""i just can't commit to it"" indicates a current lack of resolve, but the plan itself is articulated.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicidal"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by ""can't kill myself"" (suggests a desire to but inability to act) and ""Im so tired"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a good clif"" is a specific location suitable for a method (jumping).
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there"" shows consideration of the logistics of reaching the location, even if not yet acted upon. The existence of a specific location as a potential means qualifies as a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current thoughts and future considerations (""I know a good clif"", ""can't commit to it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'attempt' because no past attempt is described.
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"", ""suicidal"").
   - It also describes a specific plan/method: ""I know a good clif"". This is a ""suitable location"" as per the 'behavior' definition. Even though the user states ""i just can't commit to it"", the *plan* itself is concrete enough to fall under 'behavior' rather than just 'ideation'. The definition for 'behavior' states it ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" and ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations"". A ""good clif"" fits this description.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mentions of ""death,"" ""dying,"" ""suicide,"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is saturated with expressions of extreme emotional distress, hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and exhaustion: ""tired of everything,"" ""tired of feeling this way,"" ""tired of my life,"" ""tired of hating myself,"" ""tired of crying myself to sleep,"" ""tired of being afraid,"" ""tired of feeling disgusting,"" ""tired of remembering all of the mean shit,"" ""tired of being ugly,"" ""tired of asking myself why my life is like this,"" ""tired of not having friends.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.
    *   **Key phrases:** ""i just want it all to stop,"" ""i wish i was never born,"" ""i have nothing going for me in my life."" These phrases express a strong desire for current suffering to end and a profound regret for existence, implying a desire for non-existence.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The words ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"" are not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrase ""i wish i was never born"" is a strong expression of not wanting to have existed, which is very close to ""not wanting to be alive."" ""I just want it all to stop"" refers to the suffering, not explicitly life itself. However, the definition for 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The definition for 'Indicator' states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" While the sentiment is dire, it does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to be alive *anymore*."" The wish for non-existence is about past birth, not a direct statement of current suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and a wish about past existence (""i wish i was never born""). There are no references to past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt:** No past suicide attempts are described.
    *   **Behavior:** No specific plan or self-harming behavior is mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** This category requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" While the post conveys immense suffering and a desire for it to end, and a wish for non-existence, it does not explicitly state a desire to die or to commit suicide in the present tense. The rule states, ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" The expressions ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born"" are strong indicators of distress and a desire for cessation of suffering/existence, but they are not *explicit* statements of wanting to die or commit suicide *now*.
    *   **Indicator:** The post is full of general expressions of distress, sadness, hopelessness, and a desire for suffering to end, along with a powerful wish for non-existence. However, it *lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide* or a direct, present-tense desire to die. According to the strict definition, ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits the description of extreme general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without the explicit mention of suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself""
   - Emotional indicators: ""Depressed"", ""shit show"", ""fake ass friends"", ""shitty family"", ""one last big fuck you"" (indicating hopelessness, despair, anger, resentment).

   - It expresses suicidal thoughts/feelings (""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"") but *without* any specific plan (method, location) or preparations. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
   - It does not contain any specific plan or self-harming behavior, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""end it all"", ""goodbye everybody"". These phrases strongly indicate an intent to end one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm ready"", ""finally ready"", ""no one really understands"", ""I doubt anyone will care"". These convey a sense of hopelessness, isolation, and a firm resolve.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I already know how I'm gonna do it."" This explicitly states that a plan exists, even if the method itself is not detailed. ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks"" indicates a timeline. ""So goodbye everybody"" functions as a farewell note.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""all ready tried that before and no one really understands"" refers to past attempts to communicate distress or seek help, not a past suicide attempt itself.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""end it all"" is a very clear and explicit expression of wanting to die by one's own hand.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""ready to just end it all"" is a direct expression of this desire.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** The post states, ""I already know how I'm gonna do it."" This is an explicit mention that a plan exists. The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" This fits.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** ""I'm ready,"" ""I'm finally ready,"" ""I already know how I'm gonna do it,"" and ""So goodbye everybody"" all indicate preparation and intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""I'm ready,"" ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks,"" ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" all refer to current intentions and future plans.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** ""all ready tried that before"" refers to past attempts to seek help or communicate, not a past suicide action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""end it all"").
    *   It explicitly mentions that a plan exists (""I already know how I'm gonna do it"").
    *   It includes elements of preparation/farewell (""I'm ready"", ""So goodbye everybody"").
    *   It does not describe a concrete past suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, it goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) and enters the realm of having a plan, which aligns with the ""Behavior"" definition.

I can be as kind as I want but they'll always see me the way I am. Nothing.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I can't even fucking kill my self,"" and ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it."" It also mentions ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it,"" which indicates self-harming *behavior* or a direct engagement with a means of self-harm/suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""burden,"" ""disappointment,"" ""hate me,"" ""better off without a person like me,"" ""everything wrong with the world,"" ""screws up everyone's lives,"" ""Nothing."" These express intense hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I hold the blade"" is a direct mention of a specific method (blade) and an action taken towards it (holding it), even if the final act was not completed. This constitutes a preparation or engagement with a means.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There is no mention of a *completed* past attempt. The statement ""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" refers to a current struggle or an uncompleted action in the present.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill my self,"" ""if I did it.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""fuck they'd be better off without a person like me!"", ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""the blade.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I hold the blade"" indicates the means are present and the individual is actively engaging with them, even if the act is not completed. This goes beyond mere ideation into the realm of concrete action/preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and a current struggle with an action: ""I can't even fucking kill my self. I hold the blade but can't fucking do it."" This is present tense, indicating current suicidal thoughts and a current engagement with a method.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill my self,"" ""better off for everyone if I did it"").
    *   Crucially, it also mentions a specific method (""the blade"") and describes an action taken with that method (""I hold the blade""). This moves it beyond mere ideation (thoughts) into 'behavior' (engagement with a plan/means).
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because the post explicitly states the action was *not* completed (""can't fucking do it"").
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method and interaction with it are mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a specific method/action described.
    *   Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit as it describes explicit suicidal thoughts along with an engagement with a specific means/method, even if the final act was not completed.

People love plastic, and people love plastic people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"" - This is a direct expression related to dying.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Life's not about being yourself... stripping yourself of individuality"", ""depressed 16 year old"", ""People love plastic, and people love plastic people."" - Indicates hopelessness, despair, feeling misunderstood and unaccepted.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""how about i die then"" is a direct, albeit rhetorical, expression of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""how about i die then"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention (""how about i die then"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""how about i die then"").
   - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - It does not describe a past suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself will happen"", ""taking my own life"", ""will not live to see my 40th birthday"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""no hope"", ""All is lost"", ""pointless, meaningless, and a waste of energy"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., tool, substance, location) is mentioned. The ""computer wallpaper"" is a psychological reinforcement of the intent, not a physical preparation for a specific method. The post explicitly states ""When it will happen I am unsure"".
   - References to past attempts: ""At least I DID try"" refers to past efforts to cope or live, not a past suicide attempt (no concrete action described).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""killing myself will happen"", ""taking my own life"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""will not live to see my 40th birthday"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No physical preparations for a method are mentioned. The ""computer wallpaper"" is a sign of mental conviction but not a practical step towards a specific method. The post explicitly states ""When it will happen I am unsure,"" indicating a lack of a concrete plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""will happen"", ""will be taking my own life"", ""will not live to see my 40th birthday""). ""At least I DID try"" refers to past general efforts, not a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - **Ideation:** This category fits. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" and clearly states ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The lack of a specific method or concrete preparation for a method, coupled with the explicit statement ""When it will happen I am unsure,"" aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan (method, means, location) or physical preparations for a method. The wallpaper is not a means to commit suicide.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past concrete suicide attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is mentioned multiple times (""perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago"", ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I'm so so tired. My mind , my soul , my heart. I'm tired of being criticized and unloved."" This indicates significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No *current* specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The ""perfect opportunity"" 6 months ago is a past, vague reference, not a current plan.
    *   References to past attempts: ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy . I shouldn't have talked myself down."" This describes a past *missed opportunity* or an *interrupted action* where the person stopped themselves, rather than a completed past attempt where a concrete action happened. The phrase ""I shouldn't have talked myself down"" indicates they *did not* proceed with the act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"" and ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No current specific methods or tools. The past ""perfect opportunity"" is not detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No current signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past missed opportunity (""6 month ago"") and strong *current* intentions/desires (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"", ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, a past *missed opportunity* or *interruption* is described (""I shouldn't have talked myself down""), not a concrete past action that qualifies as an 'attempt' according to the definition (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits well. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to not be alive (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"", ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here"") but without a current specific plan.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no *current* specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The past reference is not a current plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The definition for 'attempt' requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"". The phrase ""I shouldn't have talked myself down"" clearly indicates that a concrete action *did not* happen; the person stopped themselves. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a past 'attempt'. The strong desire to have acted on that past opportunity and the current desire to die fall under 'Ideation'.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""too weak,"" ""hurt me severely,"" ""stupid ultimatum,"" ""embarrassing myself,"" ""showing how weak I am,"" ""pathetic,"" ""shitty,"" ""used by everyone."" These indicate significant distress, low self-esteem, and feelings of helplessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a desire for their social situation to improve (""I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with""), not a desire to end their life.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear there are no explicit suicide mentions.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there is no ideation.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current emotional state and ongoing social conflict. No suicidal intentions are present.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional pain, frustration, and feelings of being weak and used. There is a strong sense of hopelessness regarding the current social situation.
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The distress is related to interpersonal relationships and self-perception, not a desire to end life.
   - According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits this description perfectly.

I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working"" explicitly states it's metaphorical, but the ""unfortunately"" implies a desire for it to be literal. More directly, ""I just want to not exist"" is a clear expression of a desire to not be alive.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hollow,"" ""sadness,"" ""nothing but sadness,"" ""hurts so bad,"" ""I hate this,"" ""crying like a fucking sissy,"" ""suffer through this painful middle ground,"" ""suffer in silence,"" ""God I fucking hate myself."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not directly as ""I want to commit suicide."" The ""kill myself working"" is metaphorical.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to not exist"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes current feelings and a current desire (""I just want to not exist""). There's no mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of not wanting to be alive (""I just want to not exist""). This goes beyond general distress (Indicator).
   - However, there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, which would classify it as Behavior.
   - There are no descriptions of past attempts, which would classify it as Attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of Ideation: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""put a bullet right through it"" (specific method: gun/bullet, target: brain). The phrase ""someone please murder me becasue i dont have the balls to take my own life"" indicates a desire for death and a specific method (being murdered), but also a personal inability to self-execute. However, ""put a bullet right through it"" is a self-directed method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end it."", ""i just want to die"", ""i hate being alive"", ""i dont want to be here anymore"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""put a bullet right through it"" is a specific method (using a gun/bullet).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note).
   - The definition for 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". ""put a bullet right through it"" is a specific method. The user's statement ""i dont have the balls to take my own life"" expresses a lack of personal agency to *execute* the plan, but the *plan/method* itself is articulated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""I'm losing my mind"", ""I just want to end it"", ""i cant take it anymore""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because a specific method (""put a bullet right through it"") is mentioned. The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - 'Behavior' fits because the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""put a bullet right through it""). The presence of a concrete method pushes it beyond mere ideation, even with the expressed hesitation to act.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as no past attempts are described.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""take a bunch of pills"". This is a concrete method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation beyond the stated method. However, the definition for 'behavior' states ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons...)"". ""Take a bunch of pills"" fits ""lethal medication/drugs"".

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

40,"I hate myself so much. Overall I'm terrible. And I know I'm objective because there are some good things about me, I have a few talents and positive traits. But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward and don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)",1,ideation,"<thinking>

   - Emotional indicators: Extreme self-loathing (""I hate myself so much"", ""I'm terrible"", ""awful"", ""shouldn't exist"", ""disgusting and pathetic"", ""sad and stupid"", ""fucked in the head""), hopelessness (""My life is so disgusting and pathetic"", ""wish I was never born"", ""I hate everything""), despair (""I just want to crawl out of my skin"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces"". This is a specific method. The phrase ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good"" indicates a current desire to act on a plan. ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" shows consideration of practical preparations, even if they are a barrier.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. (""kill myself"", ""if I did kill myself"")
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. (""I hate being alive"", ""I want to kill myself so badly"", ""I wish I was never born"", ""people who want to die can"")

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. ""jump in front of a train"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the discussion of ""end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" indicates thinking about practicalities related to suicide, and ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good"" indicates a current inclination towards action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. ""I want to kill myself"", ""I wish I had the guts to jump"", ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"". No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific plan/method (""jump in front of a train"") and a current desire to act on it (""Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good""). The consideration of ""end of life stuff"" also points towards planning. This specificity and current intent moves it beyond 'ideation'.
   - There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, only future intentions and plans. Therefore, 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Based on the explicit suicidal thoughts and the mention of a specific method/plan, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""slitting my wrists"" is a specific method associated with self-harm and suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" ""feeling more alone.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A method (""slitting my wrists"") is mentioned, but it's explicitly stated as a thought that was *not* acted upon (""but i didnt do it""). There are no signs of preparation or current intent to act.
    *   References to past attempts: The phrase ""i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it"" refers to a past *thought* or urge, not a past *attempt* (a concrete action).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""slitting my wrists"" is a direct reference to a suicidal method, indicating suicidal thoughts.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not explicitly stated as ""I want to die,"" the thought of ""slitting my wrists"" strongly implies a desire to end suffering or life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slitting my wrists.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states ""but i didnt do it,"" indicating no action or preparation was taken.
    *   The mention of a method as a *thought* (""thought about slitting my wrists"") without any indication of a current plan or steps taken to execute it means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here, as it's a thought, not a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""i thought about slitting my wrists today"" refers to a recent past thought. ""growing more depressed and feeling more alone"" refers to current ongoing feelings.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. It was a *thought* of an action, not an *actual* past attempt. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. There is an explicit mention of a suicidal method (""slitting my wrists""), which goes beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits. The post ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (""thought about slitting my wrists"") but explicitly states ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"" (""but i didnt do it""). It's a strong suicidal thought with a method, but not a plan in progress or an action.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect. While a method is mentioned, the crucial phrase ""but i didnt do it"" means there is no explicit plan being described or self-harming behavior exhibited. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning"" or ""exhibits self-harming behavior.""
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect. The post clearly states ""but i didnt do it,"" meaning no concrete action (attempt) occurred. It was a thought about an attempt.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back.

   - Emotional indicators: Expresses love for loved ones, but also a firm resolve to end life (""My minds made up"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is asking for help on ""how to write good suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"". This is a direct sign of preparation for an imminent act.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm leaving soon"", ""My minds made up"", ""goodbye letters"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific *method* of suicide (e.g., overdose, jumping), but a clear *preparation* for suicide is mentioned: writing ""suicide notes"" / ""goodbye letters"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, asking for advice on writing suicide notes is a direct sign of preparation. The phrase ""I'm leaving soon"" reinforces the immediacy.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""I'm leaving soon"", ""My minds made up"", ""need my loved ones to know""). It is not about past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are clear signs of intent and preparation.
   - 'Ideation' is incorrect because the post goes beyond just thoughts or desires; it includes a specific preparation (""suicide notes"", ""goodbye letters"") which falls under the 'Behavior' definition's ""preparations taken"" clause.
   - 'Behavior' fits best. The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (""I'm leaving soon"", ""My minds made up"") and explicitly mentions ""preparations taken"" in the form of writing ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"".

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly mentions ""suicide date"", ""end thing v v soon"", ""didn't die last night"", ""sh/suicidality"". Also, ""save some flowers for me please?"" implies death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worst of this hell"", ""enough is enough"", ""I don't trust anymore"", ""TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul"", ""I'm fucking done"", ""treat me like shit or are done with me"". Indicates extreme despair, hopelessness, and distrust.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it"". This is a very specific date for a planned suicide, indicating a concrete plan. The request ""save some flowers for me please?"" also suggests preparation for death.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""8 yrs of constant attempts but obv I wasn't trying hard enough."" This explicitly states multiple past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""suicide date"", ""suicidality"", ""end thing v v soon"", ""didn't die last night"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""enough is enough"", ""I'm fucking done"", ""before I end thing v v soon"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, a specific ""suicide date"" (Friday, May 14, 2021) is given, which is a concrete plan. The request for flowers is also a sign of preparing for death.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post refers to both past events (""8 yrs of constant attempts"", ""didn't die last night"") and current/future intentions (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"", ""before I end thing v v soon"").
    *   Past attempts are specifically described (""8 yrs of constant attempts"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions past suicide attempts (""8 yrs of constant attempts"").
    *   The post also clearly states a current plan/intention with a specific date (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"").
    *   According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This rule directly applies here. The post describes past attempts AND mentions a current plan.
    *   Therefore, despite having elements that could fit 'Behavior' (current plan), the presence of past attempts combined with current plans mandates the 'Attempt' classification as per the provided rules.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post includes ""until in my grave I lay,"" ""I want to disappear forever,"" and ""I know I will die by 35."" These are direct references to death and a desire for non-existence. No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm, but a strong desire to cease to exist.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Pointlessness,"" ""sick of everybody's fascination,"" ""I am bad at both those things,"" ""sick of appearances,"" ""It's sickening,"" ""distresses me,"" ""pain caused."" These indicate deep despair, hopelessness, and a strong negative outlook on life and existence.

    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I want to disappear forever"" is a direct and explicit expression of wanting to cease to exist/not be alive. ""I know I will die by 35"" is a strong conviction about their limited lifespan, implying a desire or acceptance of an early end, rather than an intention to live. The phrase ""I want to disappear forever"" is the strongest indicator here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post expresses a desire for non-existence and a belief about dying by a certain age, but no ""how"" or ""what with.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and future intentions/predictions (""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death. The phrase ""I want to disappear forever"" is a clear and explicit expression of a desire to not be alive. This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    *   It does not contain any specific plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe past attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   It contains explicit expressions of wanting to not be alive, which means it is more than just 'Indicator' (which requires no explicit expression concerning suicide, or only vague feelings about dying/death without explicit mention of suicide/killing oneself). The desire to ""disappear forever"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging myself"" and ""taking these pills"". The user is contemplating these specific methods, even if expressing doubt about their effectiveness. This goes beyond just a general desire to die; it's a consideration of *how* to do it.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Not explicit preparation, but the active consideration and discussion of specific methods (hanging, pills) and their potential outcomes (""break the shower or the door frame"", ""make me sick but not die"") constitutes ""explicit planning like a specific method"" as per the 'Behavior' definition.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""trying to die"", ""idk if hanging myself would even work"", ""idk if taking these pills would work"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond 'Ideation' because it mentions specific methods (""hanging myself"", ""taking these pills"") and discusses their potential efficacy. The 'Ideation' definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" This post fits that criterion.
   - The post describes current thoughts and contemplation of methods, not a past action, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The mention of specific methods (""hanging myself"", ""taking these pills"") and the active consideration of their effectiveness and potential outcomes (""might just break the shower or the door frame"", ""might be enough to make me sick but not die"") aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, which includes ""explicit planning like a specific method"".

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post explicitly states ""I don't have a specific plan"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post clearly indicates the *absence* of a specific plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and potential future actions (admitting self).
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I want to die"", ""killing myself"").
   - However, it explicitly states the *lack* of a specific plan (""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"", ""probably not gonna do anything"").
   - This perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""take them all"" in the context of ""pills"" strongly implies an overdose or suicide. The user expresses regret (""why i didn't take them all"") and self-criticism (""why am i such a coward"") for not having done so.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, self-loathing (""nobody loves or cares for me in"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""count my pills"" is a clear preparatory action, indicating access to a potential means (pills) and engagement with the idea of using them. ""Take them all"" is a specific method (overdose).
   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""why i didn't take them all"" refers to a past *opportunity* or *consideration* of an attempt, but not a completed action. It's current regret about not having acted.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the intent to end one's life by taking all the pills is very explicit and clear.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the regret over not taking the pills and the self-criticism (""coward"") for not doing so, coupled with the feeling of being unloved, strongly imply a desire not to continue living.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills"" and ""take them all"" clearly indicate an overdose as a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""every night i count my pills"" is a clear sign of ongoing engagement with the means and contemplation, which can be considered a form of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""every night i count my pills"" and ""every day i wonder"" indicate ongoing, current behavior and thoughts. The regret about ""didn't take them all"" refers to a past opportunity, but the *wondering* and *counting* are current. It's not describing a completed past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is too low because there are explicit mentions of a method and preparatory actions.
   - 'Ideation' is too low because the post goes beyond just thoughts; it includes a specific method (""pills"", ""take them all"") and a preparatory action (""count my pills""). The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - 'Behavior' fits perfectly. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to end life, regret for not doing so), mentions a specific plan/method (overdose via pills), and exhibits preparatory behavior (""counting pills"").
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect because the post explicitly states ""why i didn't take them all,"" indicating a past consideration or near-action, not a completed attempt.

51,The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately. Idk why but in the past few months my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral. Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me. I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again. I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None explicitly.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""unbearably strong thoughts,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle,"" ""don't know what to do."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a struggle to cope.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: ""don't want to end up in the psych ward again"" suggests a past mental health crisis or hospitalization, but it does *not* explicitly state a past *suicide attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. Words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""die"" are not present.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post describes a struggle to *live* and cope, but not a desire to *die*.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned and there's no direct desire to die expressed, this points away from 'ideation'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions (""thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately,"" ""downward spiral,"" ""Everyday waking up... is such a struggle,"" ""don't know what to do at this rate"").
    *   Past events: ""don't want to end up in the psych ward again"" refers to a past hospitalization, but not a past *suicide attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt:** No past *suicide attempt* is explicitly described. The psych ward mention is not specific enough to classify as a past *attempt*.
    *   **Behavior:** No explicit plan or method is mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This post lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die. It expresses severe distress and a struggle to live, but not a desire to *not be alive*. The rule states: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
    *   **Indicator:** The post ""lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" It contains ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness,"" but ""suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" reinforces this. The mention of the psych ward indicates severe mental health issues, but without explicit suicidal content in *this* post, it remains an indicator of distress, not explicit ideation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""You look like you're about to die"" (attributed to mom, but the user's response confirms internal state).
   - Suicide/self-harm: ""tried to kms yesterday"" (kms = kill myself). This is a direct and explicit mention of a past action.
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed af"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Not for a current plan, but refers to a past action.
   - References to past attempts: ""tried to kms yesterday"" explicitly describes a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kms"" (kill myself).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""depressed af"" combined with the past attempt strongly implies this, but the key is the description of a past action.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrases ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" and ""I can't live anymore"" are strong indicators of suicidal thoughts, implying a desire to end life. ""This"" in context refers to ending one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I absolutely cannot fight anymore,"" ""non stop pain and suffering,"" ""Please."" These convey extreme hopelessness, exhaustion, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The user is *asking* for a way, not stating one.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I can't live anymore.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to kill myself"", ""suicide note"".
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses a clear intent to end life, implying severe distress.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"", ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond just expressing suicidal thoughts by mentioning a specific method (""with drugs"") and a preparatory action (""write a suicide note"") for a future date (""next week""). This fits the definition of 'behavior' which requires explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan or exhibits self-harming behavior. It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post does not explicitly use the words ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""dying."" However, the phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" strongly implies a desire to end current suffering or life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""always tired,"" ""so tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""tired of being sick,"" ""tired of working,"" ""so lonely,"" ""jealous."" These indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances for suicide) are mentioned. No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present. The mention of ""pills"" is in the context of medication not working for illness, not as a means for suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I have overdosed."" It also mentions ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over,"" indicating severe distress and a desire to escape pain, even if not a direct desire for death. The act of overdosing is a form of self-harm. The phrase ""it'll punish me"" also indicates self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I regret everything,"" ""suffering,"" ""nuisance to society,"" ""I'm sorry."" These indicate despair, self-blame, and distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I took 500mg Zoloft."" This is a specific method and an action taken.
   - References to past attempts: ""I have overdosed."" This is a clear description of a completed past action. ""I finally went through"" implies a completed act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The user states ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" While not explicitly wanting to die, the action taken (overdose) is a common method for suicide attempts, even if the stated intent was self-punishment rather than lethal. The key here is the *past action* of overdosing.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""took 500mg Zoloft.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the medication implies preparation and execution. However, this is described as a *completed* action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I finally went through,"" ""I have overdosed,"" ""I took 500mg Zoloft."" All are past tense verbs describing a completed action. The symptoms (""getting a headache"") are current consequences of the past action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I have overdosed"" is a direct description of a past action that falls under the definition of an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post contains explicit details of an overdose, which is far beyond general distress.
   - **Ideation:** Ruled out. The post describes a concrete action, not just thoughts or feelings.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out. While an overdose is self-harming behavior, the category 'Behavior' focuses on *current plans* or *exhibiting* self-harming behavior (implying ongoing or very recent, not a completed past action). The post clearly states ""I have overdosed,"" indicating a completed, past action.
   - **Attempt:** This is the best fit. The definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The post explicitly states ""I have overdosed,"" which is a concrete past action and fits the example given in the definition. Even if the stated intent was self-punishment and not death, an overdose is classified as an attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrases ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" and ""I'm ready to go"" strongly imply an intent to end one's life. While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the context makes the meaning clear.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I feel so at peace right now, knowing I'm going to."" This indicates a firm decision and a sense of calm often associated with a resolved suicidal intent.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method is mentioned. However, ""I'm doing it in the near future"" indicates a clear intent to *act* soon. ""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go"" can be interpreted as a form of preparation or saying goodbye, which is a behavioral sign.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not present.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I'm ready to go"" and ""knowing I'm going to"" are direct expressions of a decision to end life. The phrase ""I'm doing it in the near future"" is a direct declaration of an impending action to end life.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** It's not unclear that the user intends to end their life. The phrasing is very direct about an impending action.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go"" strongly suggests making final arrangements or saying goodbyes, which is a common preparatory behavior for suicide. The statement ""I'm doing it in the near future"" also indicates a firm decision to act and a timeline.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** While a specific *method* isn't stated, the declaration ""I'm doing it in the near future"" combined with the preparatory action of spending time with a loved one (implying a goodbye) constitutes ""preparations taken"" as per the 'Behavior' definition. This goes beyond mere thoughts or desires.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" ""I'm ready to go"" all refer to current and future intentions.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out, as there is clear and explicit intent to end life.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. The post goes beyond just expressing thoughts or desires. ""I'm doing it in the near future"" is a declaration of intent to *act*, not just think. The ""spending good time"" acts as a preparatory behavior.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/intent (""I'm ready to go,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" ""I'm doing it in the near future""). Crucially, it also indicates ""preparations taken"" through the act of spending ""good time with my favourite person"" as a potential farewell, and states a clear, imminent intent to act (""I'm doing it in the near future"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""i was suicidal"" referring to a past state.
    *   Emotional indicators: Frustration, disbelief, and a sense of injustice (""high school counselors suck"", ""what the hell…"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: The post mentions being ""suicidal"" in the past, which refers to a past state of mind or thoughts, not a concrete past *attempted action* (e.g., overdose). The definition of 'attempt' requires a ""concrete action.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i was suicidal"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not in the present tense. The expression is entirely in the past tense, describing a past situation and the reaction to it.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a past event (""it was 4 yrs ago"", ""when my old high school found out i was suicidal""). There are no current or future intentions expressed.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. It describes a past *state* of being suicidal and the school's reaction, not a concrete action of attempting suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Ideation:** The definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". This post does not express a *current* desire or feeling. It describes a past state.
    *   **Behavior:** The definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan"". No current thoughts or plans are present.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition requires ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" Being ""suicidal"" describes a state of mind or thoughts, not necessarily a concrete action. The post does not describe any specific past action like an overdose or self-harm, only that the person *was* suicidal.
    *   **Indicator:** While ""suicidal"" is explicitly mentioned, it is entirely in a historical context, describing a past event and the school's response to it. There is no *current* explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings. The post is primarily about recounting a negative past experience related to mental health disclosure, rather than expressing current suicidal risk. Therefore, it falls into 'indicator' as it doesn't meet the criteria for current ideation, behavior, or a concrete past attempt.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""trash"", ""rubbish sucking at everything"", ""hate my family"", ""no friends"", ""so sensitive"", ""suffer from u?"", ""fuck"". These indicate severe self-loathing, hopelessness, and distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states, ""tho I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything."" The phrase ""I have prepared everything"" is a direct indication of preparations for suicide.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post clearly implies death: ""vanish without a trace,"" ""secluded spot where no one will find my body,"" ""Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol."" This strongly suggests suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""nothing to look forward to,"" ""never seemed to enjoy my company"" indicate hopelessness and despair.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrases ""vanish without a trace,"" ""find a secluded spot where no one will find my body,"" and ""a pistol... at the end"" are direct and unambiguous expressions of an intent to end one's life.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

This is a clear, specific plan outlining a location and steps for the aftermath.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the decision of a location and the plan to leave notes are clear signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current decisions and future intentions regarding suicide (""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes""). It also mentions a past state of being suicidal and past self-harm, but the core of the risk is present/future planning.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions (""tonight's the night"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to end life.
    *   **Ideation:** The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to end life (""suicidal"", ""tonight's the night""). However, it does not specify a method or detailed plan (e.g., ""I'm going to jump off the bridge,"" ""I've taken pills""). The rule states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'. If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" The post expresses desire but not the specific *how*.
    *   **Behavior:** This requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" While ""tonight's the night"" indicates an intention to act, it doesn't provide the *specific method* or *preparations* (tools, locations, substances) as defined. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here. The temporal intent is high, but the *specifics of the plan* are missing.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes current/future intentions, not past actions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""cutting an artery"" is a direct reference to a lethal self-harm method, implying suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask"" indicates distress and a desperate search for information related to a highly sensitive and dangerous act.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""oxy and cutting an artery"" explicitly states a method (cutting an artery) and a substance (oxy) to be used in conjunction with it. The question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" is an inquiry about the practical execution of this specific method, indicating a consideration of *how* to perform the act. This is a clear sign of planning.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" isn't present, the combination of ""oxy"" and ""cutting an artery"" in the context of pain reduction for the act is an explicit description of a suicidal act. The user is asking for information about executing this act.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The inquiry about pain reduction for a lethal act strongly implies a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cutting an artery"" and using ""oxy"" to facilitate it.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of asking for specific information about how to make a lethal method more ""comfortable"" (less painful) is a form of preparation or detailed planning. It's not just a vague thought but an exploration of the mechanics of a specific method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current/future intentions. The question is about a potential future action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there are explicit mentions of a specific suicidal method and a desire to execute it.
   - 'Ideation' is incorrect because the post goes beyond just explicit thoughts or desires. It mentions specific methods (""cutting an artery,"" ""oxy"") and seeks practical information about executing that method, which aligns with planning. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (implied by the detailed inquiry about a lethal act) and mentions a specific plan/method (""cutting an artery"" and using ""oxy"" to lessen pain). The question about pain reduction is a form of seeking information for preparation.
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect as there is no mention of a past completed action.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" multiple times. However, these are direct quotes of what the *friend* said to the poster (""she's positive I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide""). The poster is reacting to these statements, not expressing their own suicidal thoughts.
    *   Emotional indicators: The poster expresses feeling hurt, upset, confused, and betrayed by their friend's words. They feel their friend has ""no faith in me"" and that the words were ""brutal,"" ""thoughtless and hurtful."" They are struggling with how to confront their friend and feel like a ""doormat."" They state, ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the poster.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned by the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, but only in the context of what the *friend* said about the poster. The poster themselves does not express any suicidal thoughts or intentions.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The poster is asking for advice on how to handle a interpersonal conflict and their emotional pain stemming from a friend's hurtful comment. They explicitly state they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The post clearly discusses suicide, but it's presented as an external prediction by a friend, not an internal desire or thought of the poster. The poster's distress is about the friend's hurtful words, not about wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The friend's comment happened ""a couple of weeks ago."" The poster is currently processing the emotional impact and seeking advice on how to address the situation with their friend. There are no current or future suicidal intentions expressed by the poster.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempts are described by the poster.
    *   **Behavior:** No plan or self-harming behavior is mentioned by the poster.
    *   **Ideation:** The post does *not* contain explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings *from the poster*. The mentions of suicide are solely attributed to the friend's hurtful prediction. The poster's focus is on the emotional pain caused by the friend's words and seeking advice on a social interaction, not on their own desire to die.
    *   **Indicator:** The post lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide *from the person writing the post*. There are general expressions of distress, hurt, and sadness related to a difficult social interaction, but no direct mention or indication of *their own* suicidal thoughts or feelings. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" applies, as the explicit mention of suicide is not from the poster's own ideation.

Based on this analysis, the post fits the definition of 'indicator' because the explicit mentions of suicide are external (from the friend), and the poster's own distress is about the impact of those words, not about their own suicidal thoughts or desires.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post doesn't use the words ""suicide"" or ""die"" directly, but ""jump out"" from a window, especially with scissors to ""cut the screen,"" is a clear and explicit indication of intent to end life. The phrase ""cut the screen"" with scissors could also imply self-harm, but the primary intent is clearly the jump.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""please please please help me,"" ""i don't know what to do,"" ""im only a teen,"" ""my parents and siblings are asleep."" These indicate extreme distress, desperation, and a cry for help.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, ""im at my window right now with scissors, i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out."" This specifies a location (window), a tool (scissors), and a method (jumping). This is a concrete, imminent plan.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the action described (""jump out"" from a window) is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life. The context makes the intent unmistakable, even without the explicit word ""suicide"" or ""die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump out"" from a ""window.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, being ""at my window right now with scissors"" with the intent to ""cut the screen"" to facilitate the jump. This is a clear and immediate preparation. This goes beyond mere ideation into concrete planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""im at my window right now,"" ""i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out"" indicates a current and imminent intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of suicidal intent (implied by the action of jumping) and a specific plan.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post contains not just explicit suicidal thoughts but also a specific plan with location, method, and tool. The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** This is the best fit. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (implied intent to end life by jumping) and explicitly mentions a plan (""at my window right now with scissors, i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out"") including a specific method (jumping), a suitable location (window), and a tool (scissors for preparation).
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described; the content refers to a current, imminent situation.

72,i'm gonna overdose on iron pills. i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it. i'm sorry,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""i'm gonna overdose on iron pills"" is a direct statement of intent to self-harm in a potentially lethal way, indicating suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it"" indicates severe distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape suffering. ""i'm sorry"" suggests remorse or a farewell.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""overdose on iron pills"" is a very specific method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""overdose on iron pills"" is an explicit statement of intent to end one's life through a specific action.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the intent to overdose due to pain implies a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose on iron pills"" is a concrete and specific method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""i'm gonna overdose"" indicates an immediate or near-future intention to execute this plan. While it doesn't state ""I have the pills,"" the directness of the statement with a specific method points strongly to a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""i'm gonna overdose"" refers to a current/future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states a specific method (""overdose on iron pills"") for ending one's life, which goes beyond just suicidal thoughts (ideation) and constitutes a plan. It does not describe a past attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""im going to kill myself one day,"" ""might as well die,"" and ""just want to run away to a forest and fucking die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong expressions of hopelessness (""just got deferred from my dream school... thought i would escape in college""), despair (""i dont even know what that is. life. i dont even know since it isnt even mine. i hate it!""), feeling like a failure, and intense anger/hatred towards parents and peers.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" indicates a specific location (""forest"") where the user intends to die. While the *method* within the forest isn't detailed, the location itself is mentioned as part of the desired act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""im going to kill myself one day"" and ""run away to a forest and fucking die.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""might as well die,"" ""just want to disappear,"" and the desire to ""fucking die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The phrase ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" points to a specific *location* for the act. The definition of 'behavior' explicitly includes ""suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by)"" as part of explicit planning. A ""forest"" can be considered a suitable location for someone to go to die, even if the specific means within it are not detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation like acquiring means or writing notes.
    *   Given the explicit mention of a specific location for the act (""a forest""), this moves beyond mere ideation into the realm of a nascent plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""im going to kill myself one day"" refers to a future intention.
    *   ""just want to run away to a forest and fucking die"" refers to a current desire/intention.
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   There are no descriptions of past attempts, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is for thoughts without a specific plan. 'Behavior' requires explicit planning, including specific methods or *locations*.
    *   The mention of ""a forest"" as a place to ""fucking die"" constitutes a specific location for the intended act, which aligns with the examples of ""explicit planning"" provided in the 'behavior' definition (e.g., ""suitable locations""). While not a detailed step-by-step plan, it's more than just a vague desire to die; it includes a *where*.

Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

74,"Hoping to be murdered. I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""Hoping to be murdered,"" ""I hate being alive,"" ""don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself,"" ""wish that someone will just end my life for me,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""terminally suicidal people,"" ""wish so badly for me to get murdered,"" ""how much I want to die,"" ""end it all,"" ""cowardice with killing myself,"" and ""pray for some random person to murder me."" These are direct and frequent references to death and suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, and suffering are present: ""hate being alive,"" ""losing more hope,"" ""increasingly difficult to endure,"" ""tearing up randomly,"" ""crying myself to sleep,"" ""useless I am,"" ""alone I am,"" ""defective and unfit to be alive.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post *explicitly states the lack of a personal plan or courage* to commit suicide (""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself,"" ""cowardice with killing myself""). Instead, the desire is for an external force to end their life (""hoping to be murdered,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me,"" ""pray for some random person to murder me""). This is a strong desire for death, but not a *self-initiated plan* for suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""kill myself,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""terminally suicidal"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, very clearly and repeatedly (""I hate being alive,"" ""wish that someone will just end my life for me,"" ""how much I want to die,"" ""end it all"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The desired method is ""being murdered"" or ""someone will just end my life for me."" However, this is not a *plan initiated by the individual* to commit suicide. The post emphasizes the *absence* of a personal plan or the courage to execute one.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post clearly states the *lack* of a personal plan (""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself""). The desire for an external force to end their life does not constitute a personal plan for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current desires and ongoing suffering (""Hoping to be murdered,"" ""every single day is the same thing,"" ""every day I'm forced to realize"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide and the desire to die are explicitly mentioned multiple times.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past attempts are described.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because the post explicitly states the *lack of a personal plan* to commit suicide (""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself,"" ""cowardice with killing myself""). While there's a strong desire for death, it's not a self-executed plan or preparation. The definition of 'behavior' requires ""a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior"" and ""some form of explicit planning."" This is absent.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" and explicitly states this desire is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"" by the individual themselves. The desire to be murdered is a strong expression of wanting to die, but it is not a *personal plan* to commit suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I'll experience it painfully"", ""I'm going to leave"", and ""See you all on the other side."" These are direct expressions of an intent to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""glad"" (in a dark context), ""painfully"", ""unwanted"", ""can't take no more"", ""shithole"", ""joke."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a desire for an end.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping, specific weapon) or preparation (e.g., suicide note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Painfully"" describes the anticipated experience, not a method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrases ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die,"" ""I'm going to leave,"" and ""See you all on the other side"" are very direct and explicit expressions of an intent to end one's life.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, clearly.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   *If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.* There is no explicit plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and ending one's life (""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago, he lost his mother to cancer, got bullied, got kicked out of school because of a false accusation which stated that he was planning a rebellion and how they were making a very small amount of money. The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""he was suicidal like me some time ago"" - Explicitly states the poster was suicidal in the past.
        *   ""I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother"" - Expresses a desire to give up their own life.
        *   ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" - Direct and explicit statement of not wanting to be alive.
        *   ""I just wish I could donate my life"" - Reiterates the desire to give up their life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" indicates hopelessness and low self-worth.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (like tools, locations, substances), or preparations (like notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""Donate my life"" is a metaphorical expression of wanting to die, not a plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""he was suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to past suicidal *thoughts* or *feelings* (being suicidal), but does not describe a concrete past *action* or *attempt*. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""he was suicidal like me some time ago"" directly uses the term ""suicidal"" in reference to the poster.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and ""I just wish I could donate my life.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   There is no explicit plan mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""he was suicidal like me some time ago"" refers to a past state of suicidal ideation.
    *   ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" and ""I really wish I could somehow donate my life"" refer to current feelings and desires.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit mentions of being suicidal (past) and direct expressions of not wanting to live (current).
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" ""I just wish I could donate my life""). It also mentions past suicidal thoughts (""suicidal like me some time ago""). Crucially, there is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. The idea of ""donating a life"" is not a concrete plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. While the poster mentions being ""suicidal like me some time ago,"" this refers to past ideation, not a concrete past action or attempt. The definition of 'Attempt' specifically requires a ""concrete action"" (e.g., overdose).

Based on the explicit current desire not to live and past suicidal thoughts, without any concrete plan or description of a past attempt, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm ready to die."" ""Hope it all ends soon."" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of it,"" ""tired of working on healing,"" ""fucking joke"" (hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, anger).

    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" (implying a desire for death).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. ""Stopping all my meds today"" (antidepressants, anti-anxiety, blood pressure meds) is a concrete action that can lead to severe health consequences or death, especially the blood pressure meds. This is a clear method or preparation. ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" is also mentioned as a method, albeit a slower one. Quitting therapy is also a withdrawal of support.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the decision to stop all medications and therapy is a preparation to cease life-sustaining/stabilizing care.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' includes ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs... suitable to end ones life)"". While not an *overdose*, stopping critical medication is a method to allow the body to fail or to induce severe withdrawal, fitting the criteria for a specific method or preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm ready to die,"" ""I'm stopping all my meds today,"" ""Hope it all ends soon"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is a specific, concrete action/plan mentioned (""I'm stopping all my meds today"") that serves as a method or preparation to hasten death or cause harm, moving beyond mere thoughts.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon"") and includes a concrete plan/action (""I'm stopping all my meds today,"" ""I'm quitting therapy,"" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"") which constitutes a method or preparation for self-harm or to hasten death.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes current intentions and actions, not past attempts.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of these. ""Disappear"" is vague.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Broken remainings of my soul,"" ""pain."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The words ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or ""kill myself"" are not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I just want to disappear"" and ""free from all this pain"" express a desire to escape current suffering, which *could* imply a desire for an end to life, but it is not *explicit* enough to meet the criteria for 'ideation' based on the definitions provided. The 'indicator' definition states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly indicates distress and a desire for an end to pain (""free from all this pain"").
   - However, it lacks any *explicit* mention of suicide, wanting to die, or wanting to end one's life. The phrase ""I just want to disappear"" is ambiguous and not a direct expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - Following the rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation',"" and the strict requirement for explicit mention to move out of 'indicator', this post best fits 'indicator'.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" - Explicit mention of suicide and a clear expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings.
    *   ""Ps: I just need a plan for suicide"" - Explicitly states the desire for a plan to commit suicide. This indicates a current suicidal intent and the *absence* of a concrete plan, rather than the *presence* of one.
    *   Emotional indicators: The rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" suggests deep distress and a questioning of reasons to live.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""I just need a plan,"" implying that a plan does not yet exist. There are no methods, locations, or preparations mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""plan for suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The statement ""I just need a plan"" indicates a *lack* of a current plan or preparation, not its presence. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" This post does not provide that.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current intentions and a current state of mind (""Why shouldn't I..."", ""I just need...""). No past events or attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire/consideration of ending life.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past attempts are described.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* a mention of a plan or self-harming behavior. While suicidal thoughts are present, the post explicitly states ""I just need a plan,"" which means a plan is *not* currently present or being described. The definition states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" In this case, there is no explicit plan, only the stated *need* for one.
    *   **Ideation:** This category is defined as ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This perfectly matches the post: explicit suicidal thoughts (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!""), a desire to end life, and the explicit statement that a plan is *needed* (implying no plan currently exists or is being described).

    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (relating to a failed attempt), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"", ""pretending to blow my brains out"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""almost uncontrollably saying"", ""am I crazy"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out"" is a simulated action, not a plan. ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" is vague. However, the phrase ""my most recent failed attempt"" implies a past method (staying in the car for a crash).
    *   References to past attempts: Explicitly states ""my most recent failed attempt"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I'm going to kill myself"").

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   However, the post *does* refer to a past attempt, which by definition involved a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post refers to a past event (""my most recent failed attempt"") and current involuntary verbalizations/thoughts (""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"", ""putting a finger gun in my mouth"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect, as suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I'm going to kill myself""). If there were no mention of a past attempt, this would be a strong contender.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect, as there is no *current* explicit plan with specific methods or preparations. The ""finger gun"" is pretend, and ""hurt myself really badly"" is too vague.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The post explicitly says ""my most recent failed attempt"". This directly fits the definition of 'Attempt' because it describes a concrete past action. The presence of current ideation/urges does not override the explicit mention of a past attempt, according to the rule.

The explicit mention of ""my most recent failed attempt"" is the decisive factor.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"", ""urge to just blow my brains out"", and ""pull the trigger"". It also mentions ""how it would feel to die"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared"", ""don't want to leave my cats/friends"", ""pussy"", ""can never bring myself to actually do it"". These indicate distress, conflict, and a lack of immediate intent despite the urges.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" refer to a specific method (gun). However, the post immediately counters this with ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it."" This indicates the *idea* of a method, but an explicit *lack* of a concrete plan or preparation. No other preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to kill myself"", ""I still have the urge to just blow my brains out"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a gun (""blow my brains out"", ""pull the trigger"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. On the contrary, the user states they ""can never bring myself to actually do it"" and are ""too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"", which explicitly negates any active planning or preparation. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning"" or ""preparations taken"". While a method is *thought of*, the user explicitly states they are unable to act on it. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here, as the explicit statements of inability to act make the existence of an *explicit plan* questionable, despite the mention of a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current urges and thoughts (""every single day I still have the urge"", ""I lay in bed at night, thoughts... rushing through my head""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to die.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past attempts are described.
    *   **Behavior:** While a method is mentioned, the post explicitly states a lack of ability or courage to act on it (""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"", ""I can never bring myself to actually do it""). This contradicts the requirement for ""explicit planning"" or ""preparations taken"" for the 'Behavior' category. The presence of a method *idea* is noted in the 'Ideation' definition (""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide... consider it 'behavior'""), but the primary 'Behavior' definition emphasizes ""explicit planning"" and ""preparations"". Given the strong statements negating action, and the rule to lean towards 'ideation' if unsure about an explicit plan, 'Behavior' is not the best fit.
    *   **Ideation:** The post clearly includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". It expresses strong urges and a desire to die, and even an idea of a method, but crucially, it lacks any *specific plan* that the person is actively preparing for or intending to execute. The internal conflict and stated inability to act (""without any specific plan to commit suicide"") align well with the 'Ideation' definition.

Final decision leans towards 'Ideation' due to the explicit statements from the user that they cannot bring themselves to act, despite the presence of a method in their thoughts. This indicates a lack of an *explicit plan* for execution, which is a key differentiator for 'Behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""murder me"", ""end my horrible life"". These are direct expressions of wanting to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i beg of you"" indicates severe distress and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i'll dm the address, please come here and murder me"". This describes a specific method (being murdered) and a specific location (the address to be provided). This falls under the definition of a plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but there are direct and explicit expressions of wanting to die (""kill me"", ""murder me"", ""end my horrible life"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, absolutely.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""murder me"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""i'll dm the address"" implies providing a location for the requested act, which is part of a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""kill me"", ""i'll dm"", ""please come"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - Not 'Ideation' because it includes a specific plan/method (""murder me"" at a provided ""address""), which goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings. The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ...suitable locations...)"". The request to be murdered at a specific address clearly fits this.
   - Not 'Attempt' as it describes current intentions, not a past action.
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die and outlines a specific method (""murder me"") and a location (""the address""), fulfilling the criteria for 'Behavior'.

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time"" indicates a lack of fear regarding death, which can be a precursor or accompaniment to suicidal thoughts. More directly, ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"" is a clear expression of a desire for an end to suffering, implying a desire not to be alive. While it states ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen,"" the underlying desire for non-existence or an end to life's struggles is present. This fits the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" part of the 'Ideation' definition.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post explicitly negates a plan: ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings and a general outlook on life and future intentions (or lack thereof). ""I often feel things would be better..."" indicates a current state of mind.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This is ruled out because the post contains explicit expressions regarding death and a desire for things to end, which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about dying. The phrase ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore"" is a direct expression of not wanting to continue living.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time,"" ""I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/"") and a desire not to be alive, but it explicitly states the absence of a specific plan (""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"").
    *   **Behavior:** This is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. The post explicitly states the *absence* of a deliberate action.
    *   **Attempt:** This is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""i still thought about suicide"". It also says ""i just want to collapse and let go"", which indicates a desire to cease existing or give up.
   - Emotional indicators: ""disappointed,"" ""crushed and empty,"" ""too hard,"" ""can't keep getting false hope,"" ""pain."" These show significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""i still thought about suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly through ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""i just want to collapse and let go.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no explicit plan or method, this rules out 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and escalating intentions (""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger""). It describes a current state of intense suicidal ideation.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan or method mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past attempts are described.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" ""i still thought about suicide,"" ""i just want to collapse and let go"") but without any specific plan to commit suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""planning to kill myself tonight"", ""Rest In Peace ya'll"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Everyone who could help me is asleep now"", ""my problem, my illness, it's on me"", ""I expect nothing from no one"" (hopelessness, isolation, resignation).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""planning to kill myself tonight"" indicates a clear intention and a time frame (""tonight""), but no specific method (e.g., ""with pills,"" ""by jumping,"" ""with a rope"") or specific preparations (e.g., ""I've written a note,"" ""I have the gun"") are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""planning to kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""planning to kill myself tonight"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""planning to kill myself tonight"" indicates an intention and a temporal plan, but it does not specify *how* or detail any physical preparations (like acquiring means or writing a note) as required by the 'Behavior' definition (""a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)""). The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Since a specific method or concrete preparation is not detailed, it leans away from 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""tonight"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - It's not 'Attempt' because it describes a future intention, not a past action.
   - It explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""planning to kill myself tonight"").
   - It does *not* include a specific method or detailed preparations (like specific tools, locations, or acquired means) as required for 'Behavior'. The statement ""planning to kill myself tonight"" is a strong statement of intent and a temporal plan, but lacks the *specificity* of method/means/location required by the 'Behavior' definition. Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""practicing hanging myself"", ""finally do it"", ""deserves to die"", ""thinking of death"", ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""My life is fucked now"", ""worthless trash"", ""no turning it around"", ""The thought makes me so happy"" (referring to death), ""great solace knowing that this pain... will be over soon"". Indicates hopelessness, despair, and a strong desire for death.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""practicing hanging myself"", ""train myself to break this natural survival instinct"". This is a clear mention of a specific method (hanging) and active preparation/rehearsal of that method.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are described; the ""practicing"" refers to current preparation for a future act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die.
   - Crucially, it describes a specific method (""hanging myself"") and ongoing preparation/practice (""practicing hanging myself"", ""train myself""). This goes beyond mere ideation and falls directly into the 'Behavior' category, which requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mention of a plan or self-harming behavior/preparations.

   - Emotional indicators: ""I know i'm a piece of shit."", ""feel like absolute shit"", ""I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about."", ""I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""take myself away from here"" is an expression of intent to end life, but it is not a specific method (e.g., ""jump off a bridge,"" ""take pills""). No specific tools, locations, substances, or preparations are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I want to die."" and ""I will take myself away from here"" are explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die."" and ""I want to disappear."" and ""I will take myself away from here"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""take myself away from here"" is a general statement of intent to die, not a specific method (like a specific type of weapon, location, or substance).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I just don't want to exist."" It also mentions ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel like trash,"" ""don't know what's wrong with me,"" ""draining me,"" ""anxiety attacks,"" ""don't have any purpose in life,"" ""feel like disapointment."" These indicate significant distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" are used, but in a denial context (""I'm not suicidal"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just don't want to exist"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While there's a denial of being suicidal, the phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" directly aligns with the 'Ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" The denial might indicate a lack of a plan or a conscious label, but the underlying desire is present.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': No plan, so not 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I just don't want to exist"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains the explicit expression ""I just don't want to exist,"" which directly matches the 'Ideation' definition: ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""
   - Although the user explicitly states ""Im not suicidal,"" the presence of ""I just don't want to exist"" overrides this for classification purposes, as it indicates a fundamental desire not to be alive, which is a core component of ideation. The 'Indicator' category is for posts lacking *any* explicit expression concerning suicide or desire to die; this post *does* have such an expression (""don't want to exist"").
   - There are no specific plans or methods, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""death,"" ""taking my life"" multiple times, ""suicide,"" ""suicidal,"" and most importantly, ""I attempted suicide last week"" and ""my attempt had failed.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is saturated with feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, lack of purpose, despair, feeling exploited, and a sense of being trapped. Phrases like ""I dont think I've ever truly lived,"" ""existing for the sake of existing,"" ""I dont know what I want out of life,"" ""feeling of worthlessness,"" ""world just seems so sadistic,"" ""useless,"" ""too dumb to function,"" and ""never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness"" clearly indicate severe distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post describes preparations for a past attempt: ""without a finalized note,"" ""I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own,"" ""The few weeks before, I drafted my note."" While no *current* specific plan is detailed, the *past* attempt and its preparations are.
    *   **References to past attempts:** This is a central theme. The user explicitly states, ""I attempted suicide last week"" and ""(Un)fortunately my attempt had failed.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times: ""taking my life,"" ""suicide,"" ""suicidal,"" ""attempted suicide.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes: ""I dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""I want to take my life.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? A specific *method* for the *past* attempt is not detailed (e.g., overdose, jumping), but the *act* of an attempt is described.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the drafting of a suicide note for the *past* attempt.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' requires a *current* plan or self-harming behavior. The post describes a *past* attempt and preparations for it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. The core of the post is about a *past attempt* (""I attempted suicide last week,"" ""my attempt had failed""). However, it also expresses current suicidal ideation (""I want to take my life"") and ongoing hopelessness (""I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, in detail: ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note..."" and the subsequent failure.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post unequivocally describes a past suicide attempt (""I attempted suicide last week"").
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   This post fits this definition precisely, as it details a past attempt and also conveys current suicidal thoughts and ongoing distress.
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and an attempt occurred.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' because an actual attempt occurred, not just thoughts.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because the primary focus and most concrete action described is a *past* attempt, which falls under the 'Attempt' category, especially given the explicit rule for posts mentioning both past attempts and current plans/ideation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill you"", ""I just want this nightmare to end"" (implies wanting to die).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""afraid I haven't taken enough"", ""nightmare to end"" (despair, fear of failure).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""valium"" is mentioned as a method. The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that the user has already taken valium.
    *   References to past attempts: ""I haven't taken enough"" directly implies a past action of taking valium with the intent to die, which constitutes an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill you"" is an explicit mention.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want this nightmare to end"" expresses a desire for life to end.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""valium"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that the user has already acquired and used the valium, implying a past action/preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" is a current question, but it's framed in the context of a past action.
    *   ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough."" This clearly refers to a *past event* where valium was taken, and the current state is one of concern that the attempt was unsuccessful.
    *   ""I just want this nightmare to end"" expresses current distress following the past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes a *past action* of taking valium with the intent to die (""I haven't taken enough""). This aligns directly with the definition of 'attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The taking of valium with suicidal intent is a concrete action.

I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I don't want to live at all,"" ""Some of these are suicide attempts,"" ""my suicide note,"" ""sliced hard and fast across my neck."" It details multiple past actions clearly intended to end life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't want to live at all"" indicates despair/hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post describes specific methods and preparations for *past* attempts: ""bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one,"" ""my suicide note,"" ""took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck,"" ""took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail."" There are no *current* plans or preparations described.
   - References to past attempts: The entire post is a detailed recounting of multiple past suicide attempts. The motorcycle incident is explicitly stated not to be a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide attempts,"" ""suicide note.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to live at all.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, but only in the context of *past* attempts (pills, razor, prescription cocktail).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, but only in the context of *past* attempts (buying pills, writing a note).
   - There is no mention of a *current* plan or preparation for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers primarily to past events. The core of the post is a detailed description of multiple past suicide attempts. There is one present-tense expression of ideation (""I don't want to live at all"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post extensively describes multiple concrete past actions that were suicide attempts (""swallowed every single one,"" ""sliced hard and fast across my neck,"" ""took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail"").
   - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" This perfectly matches the content.
   - While there is present-tense ideation (""I don't want to live at all""), the dominant and most detailed aspect of the post is the recounting of past attempts. The 'Attempt' definition allows for this, and the note about ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"" implies that past attempts are the primary driver for this category. Since there are no *current plans*, but there are detailed past attempts, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself"", ""I'm ready to be done"", ""I'm so close to just doing it"", ""I just need someone to push me one more inch."" The post also describes a specific action: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This is a clear description of an initiated self-harming act with suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""All failing"", ""Liver hurt every day"", ""wife told me today, again, that she wants a divorce"", ""ruin my life over it"", ""so stressed out over everything"", ""business is just about to fail"", ""fucking everything up now"", ""started crying."" These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, ""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet"". This describes a specific method (strangulation/hanging) and a specific setup/location.
   - References to past attempts: The described action (""put a belt around my neck... Right before I passed out, I stopped"") is an initiated act that was interrupted, not a completed past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""ready to be done"", ""so close to just doing it"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""ready to be done"", ""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob"". This is a concrete method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of putting the belt around the neck and positioning oneself is a clear sign of preparation and initiation of the act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event (""tonight"") where a suicidal act was initiated but interrupted. Crucially, it also expresses strong current and future intent (""I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch."").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a specific action was taken.
   - 'Ideation' is incorrect because a specific method and action were described and initiated, going beyond mere thoughts or feelings.
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect because the action was explicitly stated as being stopped *before* completion (""Right before I passed out, I stopped""). An attempt implies a completed action that failed or was interrupted by external factors, or resulted in injury. This was an initiated, self-interrupted act.
   - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm so close to just doing it"") and describes a self-harming behavior/initiated plan (""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped""). This clearly meets the definition of 'behavior' which covers explicit thoughts combined with a plan or self-harming behavior/preparations, even if interrupted.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""suicide"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""too tired of life"".
    *   Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned. The phrase ""if i fail"" refers to a hypothetical outcome of an unspecified action, not a described plan.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""too tired of life"" combined with the explicit mention of ""kill myself"" indicates a desire, even if tempered by fear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post explicitly states ""too scared to kill myself,"" which indicates a *lack* of a concrete plan or immediate intent to act, despite the underlying desire. The discussion about legality is a hypothetical consideration, not a description of a plan or preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings and hypothetical future consequences (""if i fail""). There are no descriptions of past events or attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (""too tired of life,"" ""kill myself,"" ""suicide"").
    *   However, it explicitly states ""too scared to kill myself"" and does not mention any ""specific plan to commit suicide"" (methods, locations, preparations).
    *   This fits the definition of ""Ideation"": ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It does not meet the criteria for ""Behavior"" because there is no explicit plan or self-harming behavior described. It is not ""Attempt"" as no past action is described. It is not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""We start dying the second we are born."" and more critically, ""This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" The phrase ""end this bullshit for good"" clearly indicates an intention to end their life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and nihilism: ""Fuck this fucking world and the fucking people,"" ""miserable lives,"" ""This isn't fucking living,"" ""rotting away,"" ""human life has no fucking purpose.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" This indicates a specific time (April) and a preparatory action (taking a trip) linked to the intent to end their life. ""This will be my second to last post"" also suggests a countdown or preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""end this bullshit for good"" in the context of the entire post is a direct expression of wanting to end their life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear there's a desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific *method* (like a gun or pills), but a specific *plan/preparation*: ""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" This is a concrete, time-bound action.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""This will be my second to last post"" and ""I'm taking a trip in April"" are clear signs of preparation and a timeline for the intended action. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" A trip taken for this purpose, with a specific month, constitutes a preparation.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The mention of a ""trip in April"" and ""second to last post"" makes the planning explicit enough to go beyond mere ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions: ""I'm taking a trip in April,"" ""This will be my second to last post.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there's an explicit desire to end life and a plan.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because there is a specific plan/preparation (""taking a trip in April,"" ""second to last post"") beyond just thoughts or desires.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""end this bullshit for good"") and also mentions a plan/preparation (""taking a trip in April,"" ""second to last post""). The ""trip in April"" is a concrete, time-bound action intended to lead to ending life, which aligns with the ""explicit planning... or preparations taken"" part of the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes future intentions, not past actions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"". These are direct mentions of methods of dying/self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""no body cares,"" ""no motivation,"" ""fucked myself over,"" ""no one left to turn to,"" ""i don't feel like anything anymore it's just blank."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, isolation, and emotional numbness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Specific methods are mentioned (""get hit by a car,"" ""od on meds""). However, there are no signs of *preparation* (e.g., ""I have the pills ready,"" ""I'm going to X location to do Y""). The phrasing ""i just wish i could"" indicates a desire for these outcomes rather than a concrete, actionable plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""get hit by a car,"" ""od on meds"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The mention of specific methods is strong, but the ""wish"" phrasing prevents it from being a concrete *plan* or *preparation* as required by the 'Behavior' definition. It's a desire for specific ways to die, not an active plan to execute.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""i just wish i could...""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die (""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds"").
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds""). It mentions specific *methods* but does not detail a *plan* or *preparations* for carrying them out. The ""wish"" phrasing aligns with a strong desire rather than an actionable plan.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While specific methods are mentioned, the lack of an explicit *plan* or *preparations* (e.g., ""I am going to do X at Y time,"" or ""I have acquired Z means"") means it doesn't meet the 'Behavior' definition. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die using specific methods, but without a concrete plan or preparations. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Note emotional indicators: Strong indicators of despair, hopelessness, deep dissatisfaction with life, and a sense of torture due to perceived unattractiveness. Phrases like ""daily torture of living life,"" ""Being unwanted in literally all facets of life,"" and ""I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way"" convey profound suffering and a desire for a different existence.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None present.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses intense suffering and a wish to have been born differently, but not a direct desire to die or cease to exist.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that suicide is not explicitly mentioned, nor is a direct desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there is no ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current and ongoing suffering (""daily torture of living life""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life. However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive*. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits the 'Indicator' definition precisely because it conveys intense suffering and dissatisfaction without explicitly mentioning suicide or a desire to end one's life.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""me being suicidal"", ""tried to kill myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired of people's ignorance"", ""abused and severely mentally ill"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for current intent.
   - References to past attempts: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""me being suicidal"" and ""tried to kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""me being suicidal"" implies this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"") and current state/feelings (""me being suicidal"").
   - Past attempts are specifically described by number (""8 times"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"", which directly matches the definition of 'attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions... A concrete action need to have happened in the past... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Even though there's an ongoing suicidal feeling (""me being suicidal""), the explicit mention of past attempts is the most defining characteristic for classification according to the 'attempt' definition.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""i'm better off dead"" is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive.
   - Emotional indicators: The post highlights a contrast in societal reactions, suggesting a feeling of being misunderstood or a cynical view on advice given to others versus oneself. The "":D"" emoticon might add a layer of dark humor or resignation, but the core statement remains.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"", ""don't think I want to die"", ""survive an od like this"", ""did this to myself"". This clearly indicates an overdose, which is a form of self-harm with potential suicidal intent.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""sorry"", ""don't know where else to post"", ""stomach is hurting very badly"", ""sweating badly and shaking"", ""feel like a burden"". These show distress, physical symptoms, and self-blame.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""took 44 paracetamol"". This is a specific method and a completed action.
    *   References to past attempts: The action described (""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"") is a concrete action that has *already occurred*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""i dont think i want to die"" suggests ambivalence, but the action taken (overdose) is a clear act of self-harm with suicidal potential. The question ""could I survive an od like this"" further confirms the life-threatening nature of the act.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""took 44 paracetamol"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills is the execution of a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a very recent, *completed* event (""almost an hour ago""). The person is describing the consequences of an action that has already happened.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The user describes an overdose (""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"") which is a concrete action that has already happened. The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" This post perfectly fits this definition as a concrete action (overdose) has occurred in the very recent past. It is not merely ideation (thoughts) or behavior (planning/exhibiting self-harming behavior *in the present tense* or *planning*), but a completed action.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there is no plan mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and an ongoing, recurring state of distress (""I'm back,"" ""I'm in the exact same situation,"" ""I really can't handle it anymore,"" ""I'm exhausted,"" ""it feels completely hopeless"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly conveys significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being unable to cope.
   - However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, or a desire to die*. The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post perfectly fits this description. It expresses general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicitly mentioning suicide or wanting to die.

That's great. i mean it does explain A FUCK TON in my life but it was hard to accept it at first. i'm in therapy again btw so it might get better for me. I have really bad bipolar tendencies tho so i'm a lot like my old abusive uncle except i could never hurt anyone physically, im very good at manipulation and it scares me sometimes bc ion wan be that person. other than feeling lonely and lost as ever and not knowing what to do wit my life i've been overall better compared to the rest of my life. i feel more like myself. starting to accept who i am wether i like who it is or not. i hope everyone is okay, if you aren't there's always a way to improve on something even if your at rock bottom. everyone has to hit that rock bottom to get better too, once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death. my rock bottom was having really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years. these last 2 years since i've been way better tho, weird to think so much has happened in 4 years but also so little. luv y'all please find a way to stay positive and stay safe. even if no one sees my posts this community will forever be the safest place bc i can vent and leave and if i regret a post delete it the next day",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post mentions ""death"" once: ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death."" This is presented as the absolute lowest point after hitting rock bottom, not as a personal desire or suicidal thought. There are no mentions of suicide or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses feeling ""lonely and lost as ever and not knowing what to do wit my life."" There's also fear of being like an ""abusive uncle"" due to manipulative tendencies. However, the post also contains significant positive indicators: ""in therapy again btw so it might get better,"" ""overall better compared to the rest of my life,"" ""feel more like myself,"" ""starting to accept who i am,"" and offering encouragement to others (""there's always a way to improve,"" ""find a way to stay positive and stay safe"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. The ""rock bottom"" described (""having really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years"") does not constitute a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The mention of ""death"" is philosophical and contextual, not a direct expression of suicidal ideation.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** It is clear there are no explicit mentions of suicide or wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** Not applicable, as there is no planning mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The ""rock bottom"" and ""puking everyday for nearly 2 years"" refer to past events. The user states they have ""been way better tho, weird to think so much has happened in 4 years but also so little."" The overall tone is reflective of past struggles and current improvement/acceptance. There are no current or future suicidal intentions expressed.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses mental health struggles, including a new bipolar diagnosis and past difficult experiences.
    *   It expresses general distress and feelings of being lost.
    *   However, there is *no explicit mention of suicide*, *no direct expression of wanting to die*, and *no specific plan or method*.
    *   The single mention of ""death"" is in a metaphorical context about hitting rock bottom, not a suicidal statement.
    *   The post also contains strong positive themes of improvement, therapy, self-acceptance, and encouragement for others.
    *   Based on the definition of 'indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide."" This aligns perfectly with the content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""plan on ending it soon"", ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""overwhelmed by guilt"", ""don't know what else to do"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""overdosibg on ibuprofen is painful or would work but thats likely my go-to plan."" This is a specific method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""plan on ending it soon"" is a clear expression of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""plan on ending it soon"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"". This is a concrete method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation, but a specific method is identified as the ""go-to plan"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""plan on ending it soon"", ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Ideation' because a specific method (""overdosibg on ibuprofen"") is mentioned as the ""go-to plan,"" which moves it beyond just thoughts/feelings to a plan. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes future plans, not past actions.
   - This fits 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific plan/method.

Last night/this morning I relapsed and now I feel like shit. If I had a gun I'd kill myself because I know how this goes for me and right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future. I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'd kill myself""
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel like shit"", ""not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future"", ""fucked up""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""If I had a gun"" - this is a conditional statement about a method. It implies a desire to use a gun but explicitly states the lack of one, not possession or active preparation.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts. The relapse is related to pornography addiction.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'd kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'd kill myself"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a gun"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The statement ""If I had a gun"" indicates a hypothetical scenario, not that the person possesses the means or is taking steps to acquire them. It's a desire linked to a method, but without the means currently available or being prepared. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" The conditional nature of the statement (""If I had..."") makes it fall short of an explicit plan or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings (""right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future"") and a hypothetical future intention (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself""). There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide (""I'd kill myself""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It does not describe past suicide attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The key distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. 'Behavior' requires an explicit plan or preparations. While a method (""a gun"") is mentioned, it's presented conditionally (""If I had a gun""), indicating a lack of the means or active steps towards a plan. This conditional phrasing means there is no concrete plan or preparation in place. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""My parents smoking makes my suicidal thoughts worse"" and ""i just wanna kill myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses distress, frustration (""impossible to avoid""), fear for health (""my lungs are destroyed, im gonna get lung cancer, my poor baby brother is gonna get it too""), and a feeling of being trapped by their parents' behavior and their father's anger.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., what tool, where, how), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The desire to ""kill myself before i have to see him or myself get it"" is a reason/motivation, not a plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""i just wanna kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wanna kill myself"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post expresses a desire to die but lacks any detail about *how* or *when*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current ""suicidal thoughts"" and a future-oriented desire (""i just wanna kill myself before i have to see him or myself get it""). There is no mention of past events or attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""i just wanna kill myself,"" which rules out 'indicator' as suicide is directly expressed.
    *   There is no specific plan or method mentioned (e.g., ""I'm going to use X method,"" ""I'm going to Y location,"" ""I've acquired Z means""). This rules out 'behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt, which rules out 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide plan"", ""kill myself"", ""move on from this worthless existence"", ""Goodbye reddit"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""worthless existence"", ""excited to finally move on"", ""hope I don't get cold feet"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I've got a suicide plan"", ""finally got a plan on how i can kill myself"", ""plan on doing it next week"". The existence of a plan and a timeline is explicitly stated.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide plan"", ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""move on from this worthless existence"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The post explicitly states ""I've got a suicide plan"" and ""finally got a plan on how i can kill myself"". While the *details* of the method are not provided, the *existence* of a plan is clearly stated by the user. The 'Behavior' definition states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". This matches the post.
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""My last time posting on this account"", ""Goodbye reddit"" can be interpreted as preparations or final goodbyes before executing the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""plan on doing it next week"" indicates a clear future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are clear suicidal thoughts.
   - Not 'Ideation' because the post explicitly states the user has a ""suicide plan"" and will be ""doing it next week"". This goes beyond mere thoughts and into the realm of planning. The definition of 'Ideation' specifies ""without any specific plan"".
   - 'Behavior' is the best fit because the post explicitly mentions having a ""suicide plan"" and a timeline (""next week""), which aligns with the definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"".
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a future plan, not a past action.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Feeling bad,"" ""not sure how to proceed,"" ""long history of depression,"" ""pushed me back down,"" ""massive amounts of pain,"" ""feel terrible about it,"" ""feel like a piece of crap,"" ""emotional cheating."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and guilt.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations for *current* suicide are mentioned. The post refers to ""suicidal thoughts"" but not how to act on them.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago).""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""attempted suicide.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" both historically and currently (""I've begun having those thoughts again""), which are direct expressions of suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No, not for current intent.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to a *past event* (""attempted suicide in the past"") and *current/future intentions* regarding ""suicidal thoughts"" (""I've begun having those thoughts again"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly states, ""I have attempted suicide in the past."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide.""
    *   While the post also mentions current ""suicidal thoughts"" (ideation), the 'Attempt' definition includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Even though ""suicidal thoughts"" are not a ""plan"" in the 'behavior' sense, the presence of a past attempt is the defining characteristic for this category. The note emphasizes that 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past attempt is mentioned, even if current suicidal content (like ideation) is also present.
    *   Therefore, the most fitting category is 'Attempt' due to the explicit mention of a past suicide attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) and ""I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best."" There are no explicit mentions of suicide, death, or dying.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""can't socialize well,"" ""suffering,"" ""afraid he won't want baggage like me and leave,"" ""I think I would go insane,"" ""so many issues,"" ""never felt like that's been an option,"" ""It's getting to be too much."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feeling overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific suicide plan or method is mentioned. The mention of ""cut"" refers to self-harm as a coping mechanism, but not as a suicide method in this context.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past suicide attempts are mentioned. ""Thoughts of sh"" refers to ongoing thoughts, not past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. The closest is ""It's getting to be too much"" and ""I think I would go insane,"" which express severe distress but not a direct desire for death.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** Since suicide is not explicitly mentioned and there's no direct expression of wanting to die, this leans towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific *suicide* methods are mentioned. ""Cut"" is mentioned as a self-harm method, but the post states ""I can't even cut,"" indicating it's not an active plan for self-harm or suicide.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No signs of preparation for suicide.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** There is no explicit planning for suicide, so 'behavior' is not applicable.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current feelings and struggles (""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""I can't socialize well,"" ""I'm suffering,"" ""It's getting to be too much"") and future fears (""I'm afraid he won't want baggage like me and leave. In which case I think I would go insane.""). The ""thoughts of sh"" and ""can't even cut"" refer to current internal struggles and coping difficulties.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No past suicide attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and mentions ""thoughts of sh"" and an inability to use self-harm as a coping mechanism.
    *   However, the definition of 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This post does not contain such explicit expressions.
    *   The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   Given the lack of explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire to die, despite the high level of distress and mention of self-harm thoughts, the strict rules dictate that this falls under 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" and ""don't want to live"". The word ""goodbye"" also indicates a finality associated with suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""don't care about anything anymore"", ""life is all downhill"", ""career dreams are ruined"", ""never have kids"", ""nothing in my life"" indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and a sense of futility.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""take the leap"" implies an action, but it is not a *specific method* (e.g., jumping from a specific place, using a particular tool/substance). There are no mentions of specific preparations like acquiring means or writing a note, beyond the ""goodbye"" which is a sign of intent, not a method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"" suggests a prior period of suicidal ideation or crisis, but it does not describe a concrete *past attempt* (e.g., ""I overdosed last month"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""don't want to live"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""Take the leap"" is not a specific method as defined in the 'Behavior' category (e.g., specific tools, locations, substances).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., ""I have the pills ready"", ""I've written my note""). The ""goodbye"" is an expression of intent, not a plan/method.
    *   Following the rule: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"" indicates a *current decision* and *future intention*.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, the reference to ""stay here about a month longer"" refers to a past period of suicidal ideation or crisis, not a concrete past attempt.

Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains several strong phrases indicating an intent to end life: ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"", and ""Goodbye"". While the word ""suicide"" is not explicitly used, these phrases are direct expressions of wanting to die or end one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feel so relaxed that it's finally ending"" suggests a sense of relief associated with the decision to end life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" indicates a final act or preparation before an intended action. ""Goodbye"" also serves as a farewell. However, no specific *method* (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) or *means* is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not present.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, absolutely. Phrases like ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"", and ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"" are very clear and direct expressions of a desire to end one's life. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" and ""Goodbye"" are signs of psychological preparation or a final farewell. However, the definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable to end ones life, suitable locations...)"". ""Playing a video game"" does not fall into the category of a specific method or the concrete preparations listed for 'Behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""before i end it all"", ""it's finally ending"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to end life, not just general distress or vague feelings about death.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer""). However, it lacks any concrete, specific plan or method of how to commit suicide. The ""playing one last time"" is a preparatory act, but not a *method* or *specific means* as defined under 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because no specific plan, method, or concrete means (like tools, substances, or locations for the act) is mentioned. The preparation described is psychological/emotional rather than practical for the act itself.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the post describes current/future intent, not a past action.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to end life without detailing a specific method or concrete means, aligning with 'Ideation'.

117,I need help. So I met this person on reddit who I am sort of friends with. But She wrote three days ago that she had tried to kill herself and she is now on restrictions at home. She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""she had tried to kill herself"", but this refers to another person, not the author of the post.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I need help."", ""I'm scared"". These indicate distress and concern, but specifically for the other person mentioned in the post.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for the author of the post.
   - References to past attempts: ""She had tried to kill herself"" refers to a past attempt by another person.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""tried to kill herself"", but this is about a third party.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the author of the post. The author is expressing concern for someone else.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the author of the post.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for the author of the post.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes a past event involving another person (""she had tried to kill herself three days ago"") and the author's current concern about that person. There are no past events or current/future intentions related to suicide for the author.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The crucial rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".
   - The post expresses distress and fear, but this is entirely focused on the well-being of another individual who reportedly made a suicide attempt.
   - There are no direct or indirect expressions of suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts by the person writing the post.
   - This fits the definition of 'Indicator', which covers general expressions of distress or sadness without any direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings *from the poster*.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I will hang myself now"", ""kill me with it"", ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't want to be alone anymore"", ""it makes me sick and I am scared to go out"", ""nobody has ever liked me"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I will hang myself now"" (specific method: hanging). ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it"" (active search for means/preparation). ""I don't think the thing will break off as I am only 44kg"" (consideration of method details).
   - References to past attempts: ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" indicates past self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I will hang myself now.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I will hang myself now"", ""kill me with it"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it"". This is an active step of acquiring means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and immediate future intentions (""I will hang myself now"", ""I'm now looking for something""). Past experiences (loneliness, bullying, self-harm) are given as context but the primary focus is on the present suicidal intent and preparation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It includes a specific method (""hang myself"") and describes active steps of preparation (""I'm now looking for something""), which goes beyond mere 'ideation'.
   - It does not describe a past suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not the primary classification.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific method, and active preparation (looking for means) aligns perfectly with the definition of 'behavior'.

I only feel just so very miserable (not sure if that is the right word to describe it) nothing more, nothing less, and it sucks. I can barely function. I don't even know how to just live anymore. It feels like I am being ripped apart and put back together incorrectly. I can't stop shaking. How am I supposed to live like this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This is a negation of wanting to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" ""miserable,"" ""sucks,"" ""can barely function,"" ""don't even know how to just live anymore,"" ""ripped apart,"" ""can't stop shaking."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness about current situation, and emotional pain.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, it is explicitly *negated* (""It's not even that I just want to die."").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""I don't even know how to just live anymore"" expresses difficulty with life, but not a desire to die. The post actively denies wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and state of being. There are no references to past events or future intentions regarding suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses profound emotional distress, misery, and difficulty coping with life.
   - However, it explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die."" This directly contradicts the criteria for 'Ideation' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer).
   - According to the 'Indicator' definition: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits this definition perfectly as it expresses extreme distress and dissatisfaction with life but explicitly denies suicidal ideation.

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames. Let the world know that you considered yourself normal, it is the world that wronged you and the world is wrong, not you.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (misspelling of 'die'), ""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicidal courage and determination"", ""you want to do it"" (referring to ending life).
   - Emotional indicators: ""DEPRESSED"", ""frightened"", ""coward"", ""Everyone hates themselves"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
     - ""Go out with bang, and big flames."" (Suggests a violent, self-destructive end).
     - ""With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem and it's not even funny."" (Specific tools for a destructive act).
     - ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also."" (Extremely specific method for an explosive, and mention of preparation ""research where to find the parts"").
     - ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best."" (Specific location for a destructive act).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I WANT TO DOIE"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""you want to do it"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I WANT TO DOIE"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""research where to find the parts for cheap also."" and ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home"". Specific locations (""power plants"") are also mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current desires (""I WANT TO DOIE"") and future intentions/plans (""If you change your mind and you want to do it... Learn how to make nitroglycerin... Take a vacation..."").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I WANT TO DOIE"", ""suicidal thoughts"").
   - Crucially, it goes beyond mere ideation by detailing specific methods (""nitroglycerin"", ""wire cutters"") and locations (""power plants"") for a destructive act, and even mentions preparation (""research where to find the parts""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan (method, preparation, location). The phrasing ""Go out with bang, and big flames"" combined with the subsequent specific destructive instructions strongly indicates a plan for ending one's life in a violent manner.

122,"Bully payback help. My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn't even know. Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!. With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly quotes the bully saying ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself"". This is a direct mention of suicide, but it's a quote from a third party (the bully) directed *at* the friend, not an expression *by* the friend or the person writing the post.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post describes the friend as ""mentally disturbing"", ""constantly tired"", ""overwhelmed"", and ""isn't doing well"". These are strong indicators of distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned for the friend or the writer.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""go kill yourself"" is mentioned. However, it is a quote from the bully, not an expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings from the friend or the person writing the post.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the friend or the writer. The post describes the friend's distress but doesn't state that the friend *wants to die* or is *thinking of suicide*.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:** No specific plans or methods for suicide are mentioned by the friend or the writer.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:** The post describes current distress and ongoing bullying. No past suicide attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The crucial rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"". In this case, the person writing the post is describing their friend's situation. The writer themselves is not expressing suicidal thoughts.
    *   The post describes the friend's severe distress and the bully's harmful words, including ""go kill yourself"". However, the friend *herself* is not explicitly stating suicidal thoughts or a desire to die within this post. The phrase ""go kill yourself"" is a quote from the *bully*, not an expression of ideation from the friend.
    *   According to the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
    *   Since there is no explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die *from the person whose risk is being assessed* (either the writer or the friend explicitly stating it), despite the severe distress described and the bully's words, it falls into the 'Indicator' category. The post describes general distress and mentions suicide as a command from a third party, but not as an internal thought or desire from the subject.

These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a struggle to cope.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I want to hang myself so bad"" explicitly states a method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. ""I have tried to reach out"" refers to seeking help, not an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I wish I had one reason not to kill myself"", ""I want to hang myself so bad"", ""don't know how much longer I could last here on earth"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned, but a specific method is clearly stated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post clearly refers to current thoughts and future intentions (""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""I want to hang myself"", ""how much longer I could last here on earth""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a specific method is stated.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post includes a specific method (""hang myself""). The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""want to kill myself"") and also mentions a specific plan/method (""I want to hang myself so bad""). This aligns with the definition of Behavior: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method...""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""still alive unfortunately"", ""I attempted once again"", ""still want to attempt again"". These are explicit mentions of suicide attempts and a desire to not be alive.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""unfortunately"" indicates a negative sentiment about being alive.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific *current* plan or method for a *future* attempt is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""last night I attempted once again"", ""this makes it like what my 15th time?"". Clear and explicit references to multiple past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I attempted once again"", ""still want to attempt again"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""still alive unfortunately"", ""still want to attempt again"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for a *future* attempt are mentioned. The post refers to past actions.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of *current* preparation for a *future* attempt.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers primarily to past events (""last night I attempted once again"", ""this makes it like what my 15th time?""). It also expresses a current desire/ideation (""still want to attempt again"") but then counteracts it with a reason to live.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The most prominent and explicit information in the post is the description of *past suicide attempts* (""last night I attempted once again"", ""this makes it like what my 15th time?"").
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'. Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   The post clearly meets the primary criterion of describing past attempts. Even though there's a mention of ""still want to attempt again"" (which is ideation), the rule explicitly states that if past attempts are mentioned, even alongside current plans (or in this case, strong ideation), the classification should be 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains strong implications of suicide: ""I'm at the end of my rope,"" ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through,"" ""I hope I don't wake up,"" and ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" The phrase ""go all the way through"" in this context, combined with the desire not to wake up, clearly indicates suicidal intent. ""As I've done this before"" refers to a past action.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Everything's crumbling,"" ""I don't see a reason,"" ""I'm scared right now,"" ""I'm sad right now,"" ""I'm alone,"" ""I can't reach out."" These show extreme distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions physical sensations: ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting."" This suggests an *ongoing* action or method is being employed, even if the specific means are not named. The phrase ""I know this is going to be another failure"" implies an action is in progress or has just been undertaken.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Explicitly stated: ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" This is a clear reference to a past suicide attempt that resulted in waking up.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the intent is explicit through phrases like ""go all the way through"" and ""I hope I don't wake up.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Not explicitly named, but the physical sensations (""breath slowing down, chest hurting"") coupled with ""go all the way through"" strongly imply an *ongoing* action or method.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The physical symptoms suggest an action is currently underway.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to both past events (""as I've done this before"") and current intentions/actions (""I'm at the end of my rope right now,"" ""I feel my breath slowing down,"" ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through,"" ""I hope I don't wake up"").
    *   Past attempts are specifically described (""as I've done this before"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal expressions and mention of past actions.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post describes more than just thoughts; it mentions physical symptoms of an *ongoing* action and refers to past *attempts*.
    *   **Behavior:** The post describes an ongoing action with physical symptoms and a desire not to wake up, which could fit ""behavior"" as it's an active step.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post explicitly refers to a past attempt (""as I've done this before"") and also describes a current state that implies an ongoing action or desire not to wake up, which aligns with ""current plans"" or ongoing behavior. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification as it encompasses both the historical action and the current critical state.

I have ran out of chances. Goodbye.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""intent to kill myself"", ""I could die"", ""I am going to shoot myself"", ""Goodbye"".
   - Emotional indicators: Clear expressions of hopelessness, despair, finality (""true failure"", ""no more savings"", ""everything is gone"", ""ran out of chances"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side"", ""I am going to shoot myself"". Mentions of deleting other accounts, having no savings, and an empty room can be interpreted as preparations or severing ties.
   - References to past attempts: The post explicitly states, ""I never did it."" regarding past intent, so no past attempts are described.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""intent to kill myself"", ""I am going to shoot myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I could die, or the attempt could fail.but it all doesn't matter to me."", ""I am not giving myself anymore chances"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""loaded gun by my side"", ""I am going to shoot myself"". This is a very specific and lethal method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Every other account is gone, deleted. I have no more savings, my room is empty, everything is gone."" These indicate preparations for ending life and severing connections.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past intent (""Been writing here since June, with the intent to kill myself. I never did it.""), but the primary focus is on current and immediate future intentions: ""It's time."", ""Not until now."", ""I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side"", ""I am going to shoot myself"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a specific plan.
   - 'Ideation' is incorrect because there is a specific plan and method mentioned (""loaded gun"", ""shoot myself""). The definition of Ideation explicitly states ""without any specific plan"".
   - 'Behavior' fits perfectly. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I am going to shoot myself"") and clearly mentions a specific plan and method (""loaded gun by my side"", ""shoot myself"") along with signs of preparation (deleting accounts, emptying room).
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect because the post explicitly states ""I never did it,"" indicating no past attempt has occurred. The post describes a *future* action, not a past one.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""leave a note"", ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"".
   - References to past attempts: The entire narrative describes an event that happened ""a week ago"" where the user took bleach and left a note, explicitly stating it was an attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal episodes"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""its my last time with them"", ""i thought that was the last breath i have"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""leave a note"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This clearly refers to a past event (""a week ago""). The user states, ""im a little okay now but its still in there. im sharing my story about what happened a week ago... im doing better now"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a concrete action taken in the past (""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"") with the intent to end life. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""lost all will to live"" and ""I still want to die"" are direct expressions of a desire not to be alive.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""I still want to die""). The loss of the sibling is a past event that led to the current state.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""lost all will to live"", ""I still want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" and refers to ""my end will only get nearer."" It also expresses acceptance of either outcome, including the ""end"" if the acid doesn't help.
   - Emotional indicators: ""deepest depths of myself and darkest corners,"" ""deeper than I've ever been,"" ""I'm fine with either outcome"" (suggests hopelessness and resignation).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions taking ""a few tabs of acid"" but clarifies this is to ""see what happens first"" and to potentially avoid the ""end."" It is presented as a last resort *before* suicide, not as a suicide method itself. No specific method or preparation for suicide is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. The reference to ""lsd has pulled me from the deepest depths"" in the past refers to past struggles, not past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""thinking of suicide for months on end.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""my end will only get nearer,"" and ""I'm fine with either outcome"" implies acceptance of death if the acid doesn't work.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The acid is a means to cope or avoid suicide, not a suicide method. The potential ""end"" is mentioned as a future outcome, but no specific *how* (method, tool, location) of suicide is described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" refers to current and ongoing suicidal thoughts.
   - ""my end will only get nearer"" refers to a potential future intention/outcome.
   - No past *attempts* are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months on end"") and a desire to not be alive (acceptance of ""my end"").
   - It does *not* contain any specific plan for committing suicide (no method, location, or preparation is described for the suicide itself). The acid is a coping mechanism, not the suicide method.
   - It does not describe a past suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hit a new low,"" ""havent felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and feeling overwhelmed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user mentions stealing hydrocodone and drinking, but explicitly states it was ""just to feel ok for one night,"" not as a means to end their life. This is a coping mechanism, not a suicidal plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a desire ""to feel ok,"" which is the opposite of wanting to die.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear there is no explicit mention of suicide or desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No methods for *suicide* are mentioned. The hydrocodone and alcohol are for self-medication/coping, not for a suicidal act.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This describes a current state of distress and a recent coping action (""tonight i stole...""). There are no references to past suicide attempts or future suicide intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses severe distress and a ""new low,"" along with maladaptive coping strategies (substance use).
   - However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, or a desire to die*. The purpose of taking the hydrocodone was stated as ""to feel ok,"" not to end life.
   - Based on the definitions, 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is not present.
   - 'Behavior' requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* a plan. Not present.
   - 'Attempt' requires description of past suicide attempts. Not present.
   - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. ... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This perfectly matches the post's content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, death, or dying.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I see no point in living anymore,"" ""Nothing in my life is working out"" indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a feeling of meaninglessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" expresses a desire for life to cease having value or purpose, which is close to a desire to not be alive, but it does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" According to the 'Indicator' definition, ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This phrase falls under ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness"" without explicitly mentioning suicide or a direct desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses severe distress and hopelessness (""I see no point in living anymore. Nothing in my life is working out"").
   - However, it *does not explicitly mention suicide* or a direct desire to die by suicide. The phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" indicates a lack of will to continue living, but it is not as explicit as ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself.""
   - Given the strict definition of 'Indicator' (""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'""), this post fits the 'Indicator' category. It describes general distress and hopelessness without the explicit suicidal ideation required for the 'Ideation' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" strongly implies an overdose, which is a form of self-harm and a potential suicide attempt. ""Might not wake up tomorrow"" directly indicates a potential death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fucked up I am,"" ""unfair on them,"" ""my problems are my own not theirs,"" ""They deserve so much more than me,"" ""I feel so guilty,"" ""I'm sorry you do now."" These convey distress, guilt, self-blame, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes a specific method (pills/medication) and indicates that the action has already been performed.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The phrasing ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes a concrete action that has already occurred.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""might not wake up tomorrow"" is a direct expression of the potential outcome of dying/not being alive, resulting from an intentional action.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post indicates the pills have already been ""taken,"" which means the preparation and execution of the act have occurred. This is not a plan for the future, but an action taken.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a completed action in the past (even if very recent). The consequence (""might not wake up tomorrow"") is future, but the act itself is past. The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" This fits perfectly.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There's a clear action and consequence described, not just general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. The post describes an action taken, not just thoughts or desires.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is self-harming behavior, the category 'Attempt' specifically covers *past actions* like an overdose. 'Behavior' typically refers to current plans or ongoing self-harm that might not be immediately life-threatening or a completed attempt. The phrasing ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes a completed action that constitutes an overdose.
    *   **Attempt:** This is the best fit. The post describes a concrete action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") that has already happened, which is an overdose. The definition explicitly states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" This post describes exactly that. The fact that the outcome is still pending (""might not wake up tomorrow"") does not negate that the *attempt* has already occurred.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm planning out my suicide"" indicates the *act* of planning. ""I have an intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st, by my latest"" indicates a timeline. However, no specific method (e.g., ""I'm going to jump off a bridge,"" ""I have pills"") or tangible preparation (e.g., ""I've written a note,"" ""I've acquired a weapon"") is mentioned.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post mentions ""planning out my suicide"" and a timeline (""January 1st""), which indicates intent to prepare, but it does not *describe* specific preparations or a concrete method. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both.
        *   Past: ""fear of failing an attempt once again"" clearly describes a past attempt.
        *   Current/Future: ""I'm planning out my suicide"", ""I have an intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st"", ""I will go through with this"" describe current planning and future intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to end one's life, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly mentions a *past attempt*: ""fear of failing an attempt once again"".
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   Since the post describes a past attempt (""failing an attempt once again"") AND mentions current planning/future intentions (""I'm planning out my suicide"", ""intention in the beginning of the new year""), it perfectly fits the criteria for 'Attempt'. The presence of a past attempt, combined with current suicidal ideation and planning, leads directly to the 'Attempt' classification as per the provided rules.

    *   Emotional indicators: Implied distress by the act of attempting suicide.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""hang myself"", ""leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto"". This describes a specific method and actions taken.
    *   References to past attempts: ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently."" This is a direct statement about past, recurring attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""attempt suicide"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The act of attempting suicide implies this, even if ""half-hearted"" and stopped.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the description of leaving a chair implies a setup for the act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past..."" The description of hanging oneself and leaving a chair confirms the concrete action.

I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for. Hold on to them. Because life is temporary. And from what I've learned, not everybody gets the happy ending",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now,"" and ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed."" It also includes expressions like ""I see no point anymore,"" and ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" and ""I guess this world's just not meant for me.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I see no point anymore,"" ""impossible situation""), despair, loneliness (""lonely kid in his dark room""), feeling stuck (""Im stuck. In alone.""), pain (""The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me."").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparations for a *current* suicide are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" ""I guess this world's just not meant for me.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for a current intention.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post refers to both past events (""i had an attempt when I was 14,"" ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now"") and current feelings/intentions (""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"").
    *   Past attempts are specifically described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes past suicide attempts: ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed.""
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' is ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'. Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   Even though there are no *current plans* mentioned, the explicit description of a past concrete action (""had an attempt"") directly fits the primary criterion for the 'Attempt' category. The presence of current suicidal ideation alongside the past attempt reinforces this classification, as the category is defined by the historical action.

137,I am 29 still live with my parents. 4kdjejdne sjdjd fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The phrase ""I am 29 still live with my parents"" suggests dissatisfaction or a feeling of being stuck. The subsequent ""fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo"" appears to be an expression of extreme frustration or distress, possibly an outburst. However, it does not explicitly indicate hopelessness or despair related to suicide.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is very clear that no explicit suicide mention or desire to die is present.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there is no ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to a current life situation and a current emotional outburst.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction and frustration (""I am 29 still live with my parents. fuckkkkkkkk..."").
   - There are no explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, or any plans or past attempts.
   - According to the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - This post perfectly fits the 'Indicator' definition as it shows general distress/dissatisfaction without any explicit suicidal content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""finally do it"", ""killing myself"", ""die"", ""hang myself"", ""cutting again"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""not afraid of killing myself anymore"", ""wish I could die in my sleep"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""figured out how to properly hang myself"", ""start cutting again"".
   - References to past attempts: ""I've done it many times"".
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I'll finally do it"", ""I just wish I could die in my sleep"").
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"", ""cutting again"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" implies a developed plan.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - It also refers to current/future intentions and plans (""One of these days I'll finally do it"", ""figured out how to properly hang myself"", ""I'll break killing myself regardless"", ""start cutting again"").
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and specific methods/plans, which would typically point to 'behavior'.
   - However, the post also explicitly states ""I've done it many times"", which refers to past attempts.
   - The definition for 'Attempt' clearly states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This perfectly matches the content of the post.

Like I'm feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""end it all"" is a strong indicator of suicidal thoughts or a desire to end one's life. ""Feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing"" further reinforces a desire to cease existing.
   - Emotional indicators: ""not feeling too alright,"" ""doomed.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""end it all"" is a very common and direct euphemism for ending one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""end it all"" and the feeling of being ""doomed... if I kept existing"" strongly convey a desire to not continue living.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': While the word ""suicide"" isn't present, ""end it all"" is not vague; it's a direct expression of suicidal ideation.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no plan or method.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""For over the course of a year I've been having some thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all"" refers to ongoing, current thoughts and intentions.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life (""end it all,"" ""doomed... if I kept existing"") which aligns with the definition of 'Ideation' (""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer""). There is no specific plan or method mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'. There is no past attempt described, ruling out 'Attempt'. The expressions are more explicit than general distress, ruling out 'Indicator'.

140,"Just another rant. Keep scrolling. Don't waste your time on a lost cause. I'm almost 30. Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time. I am just a  Useless, shameless, pathetic loser.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The user explicitly states ""Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful."" This is a direct questioning of their right to live. Crucially, they describe past actions: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in."" These are descriptions of self-harming actions with suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme self-loathing (""hate myself,"" ""useless, shameless, pathetic loser,"" ""miserable ass is as useless as the shit that comes out of it""), hopelessness (""lost cause,"" ""in hell""), and profound sadness/depression are evident.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Methods (drowning, hanging, jumping from a building) are mentioned, but in the context of *past* actions, not current plans.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, clearly and repeatedly: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor...""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Why should I still live..."" and the detailed accounts of past attempts to end their life strongly convey a desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (drowning, hanging, jumping from 4th floor).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for *current* plans. The methods mentioned refer to *past* actions.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes *past attempts* (""I tried to...""). While there is current severe distress and questioning of life's worth, the most critical information is the recounting of these historical actions. The 'attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Here, past attempts are clearly described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes far beyond general distress (Indicator) or mere thoughts of wanting to die (Ideation).
    *   It does not describe *current* plans or active self-harming behavior (Behavior), as the methods mentioned are explicitly in the past tense (""I tried to..."").
    *   The core of the post is the explicit description of multiple, concrete past actions taken with the intent to end their life (""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off...""). This perfectly matches the definition of 'attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past."" The user's statement ""I chickened out each time"" indicates these were failed attempts, but still attempts.

    *   **References to past attempts:** The phrase ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old"" refers to a past *desire* or *thought* of suicide that was *not* acted upon due to perceived difficulty, not a past attempt.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No. The post discusses gaining ""courage to do it"" but provides no details on *how* it would be done.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   *If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.* There is no explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The reference to being 15 years old is about a past *desire* that was not acted upon.
    *   The phrases ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"" and ""I might actually get the courage to do it"" refer to current feelings and a potential future intention.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""desire to not be alive any longer"", ""confident to kill myself"", ""might actually get the courage to do it""), but *without any specific plan* (no mention of ways/locations/means/methods).
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan (method, tools, location, preparations). The post expresses a growing *intention* but not a concrete *plan*.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the reference to being 15 years old describes a past *desire* that was *not* acted upon, not a concrete past attempt.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal ideation and a growing intent, but lacks any specific plan or method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""be dead in less than 24 hours""
   - Emotional indicators: ""the pain is too much""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today"" (method: overdose with Trazodone and alcohol; preparation: acquiring alcohol; temporal: ""in less than 24 hours"")
   - References to past attempts: No explicit description of a past *attempt*, but ""the 'if you wanted to die you would' has taught me to hide it better"" implies a history of suicidal ideation or struggles.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" is a direct expression of wanting to die and implies self-inflicted death.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Trazodone and alcohol"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""will get alcohol today"" (actionable step to acquire means) and ""I have enough Trazodone"" (already possesses means).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No concrete past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states a desire to die (""be dead in less than 24 hours"").
   - It also clearly outlines a specific method (""Trazodone and alcohol"") and indicates preparatory steps (""will get alcohol today"", ""I have enough Trazodone"").
   - This fits the definition of 'behavior' which requires explicit suicidal thoughts and a plan/preparations (lethal medication/drugs). It does not describe a past completed action, so it's not 'attempt'. It's more than just thoughts, so not 'ideation' or 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" ""dying,"" or ""self-harm.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired of my obsessive negative thoughts,"" ""struggling since I was a child,"" ""so long since I've been happy,"" ""Nothing makes sense anymore,"" ""I want to give up,"" ""feel guilty for feeling this way,"" ""bringing myself pain is me,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"", ""I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, worthlessness, and a desire to cease suffering/existence.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The words ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"" are not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrases ""I want to give up"" and ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"" strongly imply a desire to cease existing or to no longer be alive. However, the 'Indicator' definition is very strict: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given this strict rule, and the absence of the word ""suicide"" or similar explicit phrasing, it leans towards 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""I want to give up,"" ""Why the fuck am I alive""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses profound emotional distress, hopelessness, and a desire to ""give up"" on life, questioning their existence and worth.
   - However, according to the provided definitions and strict rules, for a post to be classified as 'Ideation', it must include ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" Crucially, the 'Indicator' definition states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - Since the word ""suicide"" or an equally explicit phrase like ""I want to kill myself"" is not present, despite the strong emotional content, the rules dictate that it falls into the 'Indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to let myself pass away"", ""finally kill me"", ""slowly kill myself this way"", ""I'm going to die"", ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die."" The post clearly indicates an intent to die by self-inflicted means. The mention of anorexia and specific weight goals (""90 pounds, but my new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower"") points to a specific method of self-harm leading to death.
   - Emotional indicators: A desire for control over the dying process, a twisted sense of consideration for others (""give people plenty of time to adjust and accept the idea""), and a clear intent to end life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The method is starvation/anorexia, with specific weight goals (""new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me""). This is a concrete, albeit prolonged, method.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""finally kill me"", ""slowly kill myself this way"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going to let myself pass away"", ""I'm going to die"", ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the method is self-starvation through anorexia, with a specific lethal weight goal (""my new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me""). This constitutes a specific plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The setting of a ""new goal weight"" and the explicit intent to ""go lower"" to achieve death are part of the ongoing preparation and execution of this plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm going to let myself pass away"", ""my new goal weight *is*"", ""I might have to go lower"", ""it *will* give people plenty of time"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a method is described.
   - Not 'ideation' because there is a specific method/plan (starvation via anorexia to a lethal weight) explicitly stated, not just a vague desire to die. The post goes beyond just wanting to die and outlines *how*.
   - Not 'attempt' because it describes current and future intentions/plans, not a past completed action.
   - This fits the definition of 'behavior' as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions a specific plan/method (using anorexia to reach a lethal weight to ""kill me"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Emotional indicators: The question itself implies a serious consideration of suicide.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific method (carbon monoxide poisoning) and a specific context/location for it. The question ""Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?"" indicates an exploration of this specific method.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The question about the possibility of using a specific method for suicide strongly implies a desire or consideration of ending one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a very specific method (carbon monoxide poisoning) and a specific setup.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Asking about the possibility of a specific method can be interpreted as researching or considering a plan. This goes beyond vague ideation.

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention, as it's a query about the feasibility of a method.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a specific method is discussed.
    *   **Ideation:** While there are suicidal thoughts, the post includes a *specific method* (""charcoal bbq in a tent""). The definition of Ideation states ""without any specific plan how to do so."" This post *does* refer to a specific method.
    *   **Behavior:** The definition states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by)."" The mention of ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific method. Asking if it's ""possible"" implies a consideration of this specific method as a plan. This fits the criteria for ""Behavior"" more accurately than ""Ideation"" because a concrete method is identified and being explored.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no mention of a past attempt.

    The presence of a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") being explored for its viability pushes this beyond general ideation into the realm of specific planning, even if it's framed as a question.

I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault"" and ""I don't feel like actually committing die"".

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""want want to die"" and ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me"" are direct expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire for non-existence. The phrase ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" indicates a struggle with the thought, but the *presence* of the thought is clear from other parts of the post.

    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""want want to die,"" ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me"") and directly references ""committing die."" This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This perfectly matches the post's content, despite the phrase ""I don't feel like actually committing die,"" which indicates a current lack of intent to act but does not negate the presence of the suicidal thoughts and feelings themselves.

Usually when we fight we always end positively but this time it felt different. It ended badly. It was more let's just forget this happened. We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time. I loved him so much and felt so lucky to be with him. I don't really know what to do. I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down. It hurts so much and I just feel like dying. I just wish I had someone to talk to,1,ideation,"<thinking>

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains the phrase ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. But I can't do it anymore."" This suggests a time limit and a feeling of being unable to continue. Crucially, it ends with a metaphor: ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down."" This clearly implies a desire to end one's own life, using the analogy of a sick animal being euthanized.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness (""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Nothing's real to me anymore,"" ""I can't find a way to release,"" ""I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything.""), despair, self-loathing (""I'm an abomination,"" ""What is wrong with me""). There are also disturbing thoughts of harming others and oneself (e.g., ""thoughts of hurting everyone,"" ""want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone,"" ""want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better,"" ""Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me?"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. The ""3 weeks"" is a temporal deadline, not a plan for *how* to end life. The ""put down"" is a metaphorical desire, not a concrete method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention or description of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used. However, the metaphorical expression ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down"" is a very clear and explicit indication of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the ""put down"" metaphor and ""I can't do it anymore"" strongly convey a desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   There is no explicit plan (method, means, location) mentioned. The ""3 weeks"" is a timeframe, not a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and a future intention/deadline (""I'm giving it 3 weeks,"" ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the ""put down"" metaphor is a clear and explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings, moving beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (via the ""put down"" metaphor and ""I can't do it anymore"") but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" There is no mention of how or where this would happen.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. There is no ""specific plan to commit suicide"" (no method, tools, location, or preparations). The instructions state: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. There is no description of a ""past attempt at suicide.""

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a desire to end life without specifying a plan or method.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" ""suicide pact,"" and ""my demise."" The phrase ""I don't think I would do 'it'"" also directly refers to suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""slump and horrid hole of thoughts,"" ""torment of thoughts,"" ""tired,"" ""delicate,"" ""weak,"" ""can't 'click' into life.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""I have been 'plotting' my suicide seriously on and off for months."" Crucially, it also says, ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" Drafting a will is a concrete preparatory action for one's death, which aligns with the ""preparations taken"" aspect of the 'Behavior' definition. While no specific method (like a tool or location) is detailed, the act of drafting a will is a significant preparation. The post also mentions considering how people would find them (""wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so"") and ruling out methods (""would never use a weapon from my household""), indicating thought about the logistics.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no descriptions of past *attempts* (concrete actions like an overdose or self-harm). The ""plotting"" refers to thoughts and planning, not past actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" ""suicide pact"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the ""plotting"" and the general despair, even if tempered by current feelings of being ""out of my hole for now.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *positive* methods are mentioned. However, the post details a significant *preparation*: ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" This fits the 'Behavior' definition's criterion of ""preparations taken."" The long-term ""plotting"" also indicates a level of planning beyond mere fleeting thoughts.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""plotting"" has been ""on and off for months"" (past ongoing). The drafting of the will happened ""Yesterday"" (a recent past action related to future intent). The current feeling is ""Today, I feel better,"" and ""I am out of my hole for now,"" but the underlying issues and the history of plotting and preparation are clearly stated. No past *attempts* are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there's more than vague distress.
    *   **Ideation:** While there are clear suicidal thoughts, the post goes beyond mere ideation. The definition of 'Ideation' states ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" However, the definition of 'Behavior' includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""
    *   **Behavior:** The post explicitly states ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months,"" which indicates ongoing planning. More importantly, the action ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" is a concrete *preparation* for suicide, directly fitting the 'Behavior' definition's criterion of ""preparations taken."" Even though the individual expresses feeling better *now* and ""don't think I would do 'it',"" the *action* of drafting a will is a past, concrete step towards a plan, making it 'Behavior'.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past *action* of attempting suicide is described. ""Plotting"" is planning, not an attempt.

    The key element pushing this into 'Behavior' is the explicit mention of drafting a will as a preparation, combined with the long-term ""plotting.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" ""dying,"" or ""self-harm."" The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" implies a feeling of being a burden or that their absence would be beneficial to others, which is a risk factor for suicidal ideation, but not a direct statement of wanting to die or commit suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i hate tough love,"" ""stressed,"" ""not in a good mood,"" ""brings me anxiety,"" ""sick of this endless myopic bouts of 'criticism',"" ""abused enough at home,"" ""don't need this shit among my friends,"" ""i want it to stop,"" ""if i leave them i have no one."" These indicate significant emotional distress, feelings of being overwhelmed, anxiety, hopelessness, social isolation, and feeling like a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions like ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" The statement ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is an indirect expression of feeling like a burden, not a direct desire for the poster's own non-existence or death.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.** The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is not an explicit desire to die or not be alive *by the poster*. It's about how others would fare without them. Given the strict definition that ""mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'"", and ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned,"" this leans towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** Not applicable as no planning is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current feelings and ongoing interpersonal issues.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses significant distress, anxiety, feelings of being a burden, and social isolation/hopelessness regarding support (""if i leave them i have no one"").
    *   However, it lacks any *explicit* mention of suicide, a direct desire to die, or a direct desire to not be alive. The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is an expression of feeling like a burden, which is a strong risk factor for suicide, but it does not meet the criteria for 'ideation' which requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""
    *   According to the 'Indicator' definition, ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits the 'Indicator' category because while highly distressed, it does not explicitly state suicidal thoughts or a desire to die.

The phrase ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"" is directed at another person, implying a wish for that person's absence or death, not the poster's own.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expressions by the poster about *their own* desire to die or not be alive. The ""i'm so tired"" and ""no more energy"" convey exhaustion and despair, but not a direct suicidal wish.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is characterized by intense emotional distress, anger, and a sense of hopelessness about the world and a specific situation/person.
    *   However, it *lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide* or a direct desire by the poster to end their own life. The ""i'm so tired"" and ""no more energy"" are expressions of emotional exhaustion, not suicidal ideation.
    *   There are no plans, methods, or past attempts mentioned.
    *   According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" This post fits that description.
    *   Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to not be alive, it cannot be 'ideation'.
    *   Since there is no plan or self-harm, it cannot be 'behavior'.
    *   Since there is no past attempt, it cannot be 'attempt'.

    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Not directly ""I want to die,"" but the phrase ""I'm sick of _this_ life"" coupled with ""nothing is going to change"" and ""I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape"" strongly conveys a desire to escape the current unbearable existence, which aligns with the definition of 'ideation' (""a desire to not be alive any longer""). The presence of the word ""kill myself"" itself, even in a denial, combined with the extreme distress, pushes it beyond a mere 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and a bleak outlook on the future (""nothing is going to change,"" ""what's next for me""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned, even if in a denial, and the subsequent content describes deep despair and feeling trapped, which are more than just ""general expressions of distress or sadness.""
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post contains an explicit mention of ""kill myself"" and strong expressions of hopelessness, feeling trapped (""walls are closing in and there's no escape""), and being ""sick of _this_ life"" with no prospect of change. These elements together suggest a desire to escape the current unbearable state of being, which is a form of suicidal ideation, even if a direct ""I want to die"" statement is absent. There is no specific plan mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out due to the absence of any specific plan, method, or preparations.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

    The phrase ""I don't want to kill myself, but..."" is crucial. The ""but"" introduces the overwhelming reasons why someone *would* consider it, and the subsequent description of feeling trapped and hopeless (""walls are closing in and there's no escape"") strongly indicates a desire to escape an unbearable existence, which is the core of ideation.

153,Life just gets more and more overwhelming and difficult. How to deal with suicidal thoughts and ideations. I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family but I know I shouldn't I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out . Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts and ideations"", ""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""overwhelming and difficult"", ""in a rut"", ""very small support system"", ""too weak and pathetic"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""die tomorrow while my mom is out with family"", ""I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"". This suggests a specific timeline and a farewell-type preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal thoughts and ideations"", ""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific physical method (e.g., gun, rope), but a specific *timeframe* (""tomorrow"") and *context* (""while my mom is out with family"") are mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" can be interpreted as a farewell or preparatory action before an intended act. This indicates a plan beyond just a thought.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I probably will hit up everyone"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond just ideation by mentioning a specific timeframe (""tomorrow"") and a potential preparatory action/farewell (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out""). While not a concrete method, the specific timing and the social preparation elements constitute a form of planning as per the 'Behavior' definition (""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken""). The phrase ""I want to die tomorrow"" is a concrete, time-bound intention.
   - It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The presence of a specific time (""tomorrow"") and preparatory actions (""hit up everyone"") elevates it from 'ideation' to 'behavior'. Even with the concluding statement about being ""too weak and pathetic to do it,"" the preceding sentences clearly outline a plan for ""tomorrow.""

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""yeet myself"" is a strong slang indicator for self-harm or suicide. ""Dead inside"" indicates emotional numbness. ""Beyond saving"" suggests extreme hopelessness.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""huge depressive episode,"" ""dead inside,"" ""still sad,"" ""still anhedonic,"" ""just want to cry."" These all point to severe distress, hopelessness, and anhedonia.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., ""jump,"" ""take pills,"" ""use a specific tool"") or preparation (e.g., ""writing a note,"" ""acquiring means"") is mentioned. ""Yeet myself"" implies a desire for an action, but not a concrete plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** While the word ""suicide"" is not used, ""yeet myself"" is a clear, explicit expression of a desire to end one's life or self-harm in a severe way. The context of ""beyond saving"" and ""dead inside"" reinforces this interpretation.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" clearly expresses a strong desire to end one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method (e.g., ""jump off a bridge,"" ""take an overdose,"" ""use a specific weapon"") is mentioned. ""Yeet myself"" is a general desire for an action, not a detailed plan.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   *If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.* Since no specific method or preparation is detailed, 'behavior' is not indicated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings (""I'm still dead inside,"" ""still sad,"" ""I just want to cry and yeet myself"") and current desires/intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because ""yeet myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/desire, not just general distress or vague feelings about death.
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""yeet myself way too much""), but it *lacks any specific plan* (method, location, or preparation). This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific plan or method mentioned. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because it describes current feelings and desires, not a past concrete action/attempt.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

God im such a fucking loser. i could really use someone to talk too. All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all. I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded."" ""End it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, and ""wish I succeeded"" refers to the outcome of that past action.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i fucked up this time,"" ""God im such a fucking loser,"" ""despair"" (due to potential loss of license/job/independence).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for a *current* action.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, ""I tried to end it once before.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""I tried to end it once before"" and ""wish i succeeded.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" implies a desire for the past attempt to have been successful, meaning a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for a *current* intention.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for a *current* intention.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It explicitly refers to a *past event* (""I tried to end it once before"") and a *current wish* regarding that past event (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded""). There are no current plans.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly describes a ""past attempt at suicide"" with the phrase ""I tried to end it once before."" This directly matches the definition of the 'Attempt' category: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide."" While there is current ideation (wishing the past attempt succeeded), the explicit mention of a past *action* is the defining factor for this category.

   - Emotional indicators: ""bad panic attack"", ""out of fear""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I just wanna kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just wanna kill myself"".
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions (""I just wanna kill myself out of fear"").
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I just wanna kill myself,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts. This eliminates 'Indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan (e.g., method, location, tools) or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""dying."" Phrases like ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" strongly imply a desire to end suffering/life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Screaming at me to give up,"" ""defeated,"" ""torture cycle."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and mental anguish.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No *direct* or *explicit* expression like ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" The phrases ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"" are strong *implications* of a desire to end life, but the definition for 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions"" and the 'Indicator' definition emphasizes that ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Based on this strict interpretation, the expressions are not explicit enough for 'Ideation'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""Now my brain is screaming,"" ""I'll never be out of this,"" ""why keep going?"").
   - Past attempts are not described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness, and a desire to end a painful cycle.
   - However, it does not explicitly use terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""I want to die/not be alive.""
   - The 'Indicator' definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - The 'Ideation' definition requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""
   - Given the strict requirement for explicitness for 'Ideation' and the ""when in doubt"" rule, this post falls into 'Indicator' because the desire to end life is implied but not explicitly stated using direct suicidal language.

So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""planning to commit suicide"", ""end it"", ""have to go"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""genuinely upset"", ""can't change my circumstances"", ""never be happy"", ""miserable"", ""angry"", ""sad"", ""no choice but to end it"". These indicate significant distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, or preparations are specified.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""planning to commit suicide"", ""end it"", ""have no choice but to end it"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'll never be happy if I continue to live"", ""I have to go"", ""no choice but to end it"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post states ""planning to commit suicide"" but does not detail *how* or *with what*. This is an expression of intent/desire, not a specific plan as defined for 'behavior'. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""planning to commit suicide"", ""I have to go""). It does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times.
   - It is not 'behavior' because while there is an explicit desire/intent to end life, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., specific tool, location, or action). The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" expresses the *thought* or *decision* to do so, but not the *how* which is required for 'behavior'.
   - It is not 'attempt' because it refers to current/future intentions, not a past action.
   - Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit, as it explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, but without a specific plan.

I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""attempting suicide"" multiple times (""going through with attempting suicide"", ""I was so close to attempting suicide"").
    *   Emotional indicators: ""regretting it immensely"", ""not mentally stable enough"", ""mortifying and embarrassing"", ""want to rip my hair out"", ""do not like living with them"", ""feel nauseous"", ""dreading this"", ""cannot stand living with my family"". These indicate significant distress, regret, and discomfort.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations for a *current* suicide attempt are mentioned. The mentions of suicide refer to a past intention that was *averted*.
    *   References to past attempts: The post states, ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am..."". This clearly indicates that an attempt was *considered* and came very close to happening, but was ultimately *not carried out*. The person reached out instead.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""attempting suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct *current* expression of wanting to die. The expressions relate to a past choice to *not* attempt suicide and the negative consequences of that choice.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post describes *averting* an attempt by confiding in family, not preparing for one.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The suicidal content refers to a *past potential attempt* that was *prevented* by reaching out. The current situation is the consequence of *not* attempting suicide. There are no current suicidal intentions or plans expressed.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Behavior:** This is incorrect because there is no mention of a *current* plan to commit suicide or self-harming behavior. The post describes a past *averted* attempt.
    *   **Attempt:** This is incorrect. The definition states: ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past... When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" The post explicitly states the attempt was *not* carried out (""I was so close to attempting suicide *but* in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom""). Therefore, no concrete action happened.
    *   **Ideation:** This is the best fit. The definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" While the desire to not be alive is presented in a past context (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide,"" ""I was so close to attempting suicide""), these are clear ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" The post describes the intensity of these past thoughts/feelings that almost led to an action, but ultimately did not involve a completed plan or action. The post contains the *expression* of these thoughts/feelings, even if they refer to a past, averted crisis.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"". This is a direct mention of suicide, but it's a *negation* of the act.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it"", ""the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity"", ""Its excruciating"". These indicate severe emotional distress and pain.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to suicide. The desire to ""break everything"" is an expression of anger/frustration, not a suicidal plan.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" (or ""kill myself"") is present.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. On the contrary, the post explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"", which is a denial of wanting to die or commit suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings of pain and distress.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses extreme pain and distress (""I cant take it"", ""Its excruciating"").
    *   Crucially, it explicitly states ""I wont kill myself of course"". This is a clear negation of suicidal intent or desire.
    *   According to the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer..."" The post *lacks* this desire; it explicitly denies it. The definition further clarifies: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
    *   Although the word ""suicide"" is mentioned, its context is a denial of suicidal action or desire. The core meaning conveyed is intense pain *without* suicidal intent.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'Indicator' category, which covers general expressions of distress where there is ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (as the explicit negation clarifies the absence of such thoughts/feelings).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The post expresses distress, frustration, and gender dysphoria (""I wish I could stop obsessing"", ""intensified my gender dysphoria"", ""I hate wearing makeup""). It conveys discomfort and a desire for change (""I want to be a male now""), but not explicit hopelessness or despair related to ending life.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on gender identity and discomfort with appearance, not a desire to cease living.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': There is no ambiguity; suicide is not mentioned at all.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there are no suicidal thoughts expressed.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and desires (""I wish I could stop"", ""has only intensified"", ""I hate"", ""I want""). There is no mention of past events related to suicide.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post clearly expresses distress and dissatisfaction related to gender dysphoria and societal pressures. However, it completely lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any form of self-harm, plan, or past attempt. According to the definitions, the 'Indicator' category applies when ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This perfectly matches the content of the post.

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I wish I had the courage to end it all"" is a direct and explicit expression of suicidal ideation.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" clearly conveys a desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I wish I had the courage to end it all"" refers to a current desire or state of mind, a potential future intention if courage were found. It does not describe a past event.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""I wish I had the courage to end it all"").
    *   However, it does *not* include any specific plan (method, location, tools) or preparations.
    *   It does *not* describe a past suicide attempt.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'Indicator' is ruled out because there is an explicit mention of suicide (""end it all"").
        *   'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan or method mentioned.
        *   'Attempt' is ruled out because no past attempt is described.
        *   'Ideation' perfectly matches: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now,"" and explicitly, ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with, yet i still consider.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""my anxiety has gotten much more severe,"" ""interfering with almost everything i do,"" ""really sick of my family,"" ""shitty parents and siblings."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states, ""i didn't have anything to do it with,"" indicating a *lack* of means or a plan for the past near-event. No specific plan or method is mentioned for the current ""yet i still consider"" thought.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with."" This describes a very strong intention or a near-miss, but critically, it states the action did not occur due to lack of means. The definition of 'attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""almost committed suicide,"" and ""yet i still consider.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post highlights the *absence* of means for the past event (""didn't have anything to do it with"") and does not provide any specific method or plan for the current consideration.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide"" refers to a past event.
    *   ""yet i still consider"" refers to current and ongoing suicidal thoughts/intentions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire not to be alive (""i probably wouldn't be alive right now,"" ""yet i still consider""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly states a *lack* of means/plan for the past event (""didn't have anything to do it with"") and does not present any specific plan or method for the *current* consideration. This rules out 'behavior'.
    *   The 'attempt' category requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened in the past. The phrase ""almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" indicates that a concrete action did *not* happen; it was a strong intention or near-miss thwarted by external factors (lack of means). Therefore, it does not fit the definition of 'attempt'.
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""yet i still consider,"" ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now"") but without a specific plan. The past event, while serious, is described as not having resulted in a concrete action. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'ideation'.

165,suicide with me. can anyone suicide with me together. for those want to suicide too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned multiple times (""suicide with me"", ""anyone suicide with me"", ""want to suicide"").
   - Emotional indicators: Implies a desire to end one's life and a search for companionship in this act.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, location, or preparation is mentioned. It's a general call.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrases ""suicide with me"" and ""want to suicide"" clearly indicate a desire to end life.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to commit it, but without any specific plan or method. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It does not describe a past attempt ('attempt'), nor does it include a specific plan or self-harming behavior ('behavior'). It goes beyond general distress as it explicitly mentions suicide, ruling out 'indicator'.

I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to kms"", ""kill myself"", ""hang myself"", ""killing myself"", ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""can't stop thinking"", ""can't focus on anything except trying again"", ""deserve"", ""burden"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""hang myself"" (specific method). ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung"" (physical action taken related to the method/preparation).
   - References to past attempts: The ""practice hung"" is a past action but is described as a ""practice"" for a current desire, and the user stopped due to fear of failure, not because it was a full attempt. It's more indicative of current behavioral engagement with the method.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kms"", ""kill myself"", ""hang myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I really want to hang myself right now"", ""I can't stop thinking about killing myself"", ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"", ""put the rope around my neck"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"". This is a direct physical engagement with the means, even if it was a ""practice"" and stopped.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions and recent actions related to those intentions: ""I really want to hang myself right now"", ""I can't stop thinking about killing myself"", ""I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again"", ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"". The ""practice hung"" refers to a recent action taken in the context of these current feelings and desires.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Ideation' is incorrect because the post goes beyond just thoughts; it describes a specific method and a physical action taken with that method (""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung"").
   - 'Behavior' fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to kms"", ""I really want to hang myself right now""), mentions a specific plan/method (""hang myself""), and describes a physical action taken related to that plan (""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung""). This action, even if called ""practice"" and stopped, demonstrates engagement with the means and aligns with ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" or ""preparations taken"" as per the definition.
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect because the described action (""practice hung"") was stopped and not intended to be lethal in that instance, and the user is still contemplating trying again, rather than describing a past, failed, full attempt.

I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""violently suicidal,"" ""I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more,"" and mentions ""suicidal ideation"" in the past.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of distress, hopelessness, feeling overwhelmed, feeling like a burden, feeling uncared for (""sobbing,"" ""overwhelmed,"" ""fucking failure,"" ""he didn't even fucking care"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user states, ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" This is a specific method (gun) being mentioned in the context of current intent to act (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""It's finally fucking time""). There are no explicit signs of preparations taken (e.g., already acquired the gun).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are described. The mention of ""suicidal ideation"" refers to past thoughts, not actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""violently suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more,"" ""I'll be dead"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""get a gun"" is mentioned as a method the user has ""always thought"" about and is now bringing up in the context of imminent action.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring the gun).
    *   The user expresses uncertainty about the *exact* ""how"" but immediately follows it with a specific method they've considered, which is a key element of planning. The definition of 'behavior' includes ""a specific method"" like ""guns.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post refers to current and future intentions (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""It's finally fucking time,"" ""I think I know that I'm going to go through with it""). Past ""suicidal ideation"" is mentioned, but the core focus is on current intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because a specific method (""get a gun"") is mentioned in the context of current intent to act. The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a clear intent to act (""I'm finally doing it""). Crucially, it also mentions a specific method (""get a gun"") that the user has considered, which, even if not fully prepared for, constitutes a form of explicit planning as per the definition (""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life""). The immediate nature of ""I'm finally doing it"" combined with a concrete method pushes it beyond mere ideation.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""full intentions to end things"" (a clear euphemism for suicide), ""doesn't want me dead"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""apathetic about my existing"", ""want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"" (desire for escape, numbness, hopelessness).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This indicates a specific location chosen with a specific intent, which constitutes a preparation or part of a plan.
   - References to past attempts: No past *completed* attempts are described. The driving to the mountains was an action taken with intent, but the act of ""ending things"" was not carried out.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, ""full intentions to end things"" is a very strong and direct expression of suicidal intent. ""Doesn't want me dead"" also points to this.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""full intentions to end things"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific *method* (e.g., jumping), but a specific *location* (""mountains"") was chosen and travelled to ""with full intentions to end things."" The definition of 'behavior' includes ""suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from)"" and ""preparations taken."" Driving to a specific location with the intent to ""end things"" there fits this.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions"" is a concrete preparatory action.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning: The act of physically going to a chosen location with the stated intent moves it beyond mere ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I just finished driving up to the mountains..."" indicates a very recent past action. ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" refers to current intention *not* to complete the act, but the preparatory action *did* happen. This is not a past completed attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of suicidal intent (""end things"") and a concrete action taken towards a plan.
   - Not 'Ideation' because there is more than just thoughts/feelings; there was a physical action (driving to the location) taken as part of a plan. The definition of 'ideation' states ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - It fits 'Behavior' because the user drove to a specific location (""mountains"") ""with full intentions to end things."" This constitutes a ""preparation taken"" and involves a ""suitable location"" as per the definition of 'behavior', even if the final act was not carried out. The act of physically going to the location with intent is a behavioral manifestation of a plan.
   - Not 'Attempt' because the post explicitly states, ""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" meaning the act of ending things was not completed. An 'attempt' requires a ""concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" This was a preparation, not a completed attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm ready to die"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"". These are direct expressions of a desire to end life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Fuck this world"", ""nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life"" indicate despair and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""The date was set a while ago. I even changed it"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go."" While a specific method (e.g., gun, bridge) is not named, the phrases ""date was set"", ""preps being made"", and ""strapped in and ready to go"" strongly imply that a concrete plan exists and preparations are actively underway or complete. This goes beyond just thinking about it.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""ready to die"" and ""go out the way I want"" are direct expressions of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly, but the existence of a ""set date"" and ""preps being made"" and being ""strapped in and ready to go"" signifies explicit planning and preparation. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken"". This post clearly indicates preparations are being made and a plan is in place.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and imminent future intentions. ""I'm ready to die"", ""Preps being made"", ""ready to go"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die and clear signs of preparation.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires to die. The mention of a ""date was set"" and ""preps being made"" and being ""strapped in and ready to go"" indicates concrete planning and preparation, which moves it into 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While the *specific* method isn't detailed, the *preparations* are.
   - 'Behavior' fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm ready to die"") and clearly mentions ""a plan to commit suicide"" through the phrases ""The date was set"", ""Preps being made"", and ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"", which signify preparations taken.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as no past attempt is described. The post is about current intent and preparation.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""Im thinking of ending my life."" This is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hate my course,"" ""depression,"" ""angsty,"" ""friends have all pretty much ditched me,"" ""panic attack."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned. The post states the thought but no how, when, or where.
   - References to past attempts: No. The post describes past academic and social struggles, but not past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Im thinking of ending my life.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - ""Im thinking of ending my life"" refers to a current intention/thought.
   - The rest of the post provides background context of past difficulties (OCD, grades, social issues) leading to the current state, but these are not past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""Im thinking of ending my life,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., tools, locations, notes). This rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This perfectly matches the post.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up"" strongly indicate a desire to die or not be alive. ""its working!"" suggests an action related to this desire is in progress.
    *   Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, a wish for cessation of life.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""its working!"" implies a method is being employed or has been initiated, but the *specific* method, tools, or location are not mentioned. There are no explicit signs of preparation like a suicide note or acquiring specific means.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up"" are direct expressions of a desire to die or not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post says ""its working!"" but does not specify *what* is working (e.g., pills, rope, jumping).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""its working!"" implies an action is underway, but it doesn't describe *preparations* in the sense of acquiring specific means or writing a note. It suggests the *act* itself might be in progress, but without details of the *plan*.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Since no specific method or detailed plan is outlined, despite the implication of an ongoing action, it leans towards ideation based on this rule.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""its working!"" and ""hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up"" refer to current actions/intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are very explicit expressions of wanting to die (""last post,"" ""never wake up"").
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because it describes current intentions/actions, not a past concrete attempt.
    *   **Behavior:** The post implies an action (""its working!"") but lacks the *specificity* required for 'behavior' (e.g., ""lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by)""). Without a named method or specific details of the plan, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up"") but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""its working!"" suggests an action but doesn't provide the *specifics* of a plan required for 'behavior'.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""im gonna do it"", ""tonight im gonna do it"", ""im so ready to die"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""im so ready to die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""42 unnamed pills"", ""old antidepressants"", ""allergy medicine"", ""easy to swallow"". This clearly outlines a method (overdose) and the specific means (the pills).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the possession of the pills and the stated intent to use them ""tonight"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""tonight im gonna do it""). The past references are to *previous ideation/threats*, not past *attempts*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""im so ready to die"", ""im gonna do it"").
   - It also explicitly mentions a specific plan/means: ""42 unnamed pills"", ""old antidepressants"", ""allergy medicine"", and the intent to use them (""easy to swallow"", ""tonight im gonna do it""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* a plan/method/preparation.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because there is a specific plan/method.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because it describes future intent, not a past completed action.
   - It is not 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned and a plan is detailed.

173,"I want to be done. I feel so tired and alone. I've struggled with mental illness since I was a kid and I just want to be done with everything. I don't feel like anyone loves me or even likes me, except maybe my parents but I don't feel like it goes beyond loving me just cause I'm their kid. They don't actually love me for me. And even if they do, I don't feel like I can open up and talk with them about how I'm feeling and about my problems. I'm just to anxious to do it. I'm very lonely. I've only ever had a friend once in my life, but it didn't continue after third grade. I wish I had someone I was I'm;octant to. Someone I could trust and openly talk to about anything, who made me feel safe and wanted. I'm tire of being an unwanted nuisance to everyone around me. I want to go somewhere where I feel like I belong. More and more often it feels like the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself. I guess it does feel good to at least get all of this off my chest.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""More and more often it feels like the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself."" It also uses phrases like ""I want to be done"" and ""I just want to be done with everything.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired,"" ""alone,"" ""struggled with mental illness,"" ""lonely,"" ""anxious,"" ""unwanted nuisance."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. There are no details about how, where, or when the user intends to ""kill myself.""
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" is a direct and explicit mention.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to be done,"" ""I just want to be done with everything,"" and the statement that killing oneself is ""the only way"" to feel okay.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post expresses a desire and a thought about suicide but lacks any concrete details of a plan or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrasing ""More and more often it feels like the only way... would be to just be done and kill myself"" indicates current and evolving thoughts/intentions, not a past event.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""want to be done"") and a desire to end one's life as a solution to distress. This rules out 'Indicator' as it's more than vague distress.
   - However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or specific actions outlined). This rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

It is not that I have any moral problem with suicide at this point or even care about what me unexpectedly checking out would do to the other in my life but it just seems like such a waste to go out this way when I have held on for so long but I have come to realize recently that even spite has its limits.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post uses phrases like ""I really want to check out"", ""how much I want to check out"", ""unexpectedly checking out"", and explicitly states ""moral problem with suicide"". ""Go out this way"" also implies ending one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""running on nothing but shear spite"", ""can not really express how much"", ""even spite has its limits"". These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and a strong desire to end their life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""moral problem with suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I really want to check out"" is a clear and repeated expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and feelings (""I'm truly running"", ""I really want to check out"", ""seems to be holding me here at this point"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a strong desire to ""check out"" (die). This fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... to stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life (albeit without a specific plan how to do so)"".
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no mention of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The mention of ""suicide"" and the strong desire to ""check out"" goes beyond general distress, ruling out 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrases ""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im going to do it,"" and ""im done"" strongly imply an intent to end one's life, even without using the word ""suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""im in so much pain and i cant handle it anymore,"" ""i cant. i cant."" indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method (e.g., how, where, with what), or preparation (e.g., a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Im going to do it"" is a declaration of intent, not a plan.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not explicitly used. However, ""im going to do it"" in the context of extreme pain and ""i cant do this anymore"" is a very direct and explicit expression of intent to end one's life, aligning with ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" It's beyond a vague feeling about dying; it's a declaration of intent to act.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""im going to do it"" and ""im done"" strongly convey a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no specific plan or method is mentioned, it cannot be classified as 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""im going to do it"" refers to a current/future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator': The post contains explicit expressions of intent to end life (""im going to do it,"" ""im done""), which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
   - Not 'Behavior': There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, substances, or notes are specified). The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
   - Not 'Attempt': The post describes current/future intent, not a past action.
   - This fits 'Ideation' because it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive any longer (""im going to do it,"" ""im done"") but without any specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is explicitly stated.
   - Emotional indicators: ""stupid,"" ""lot of stress,"" ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life,"" ""why not"" indicate hopelessness, despair, and a desire to end suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post asks ""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"". This is an inquiry about methods, but not a statement of a specific plan the user has adopted or is preparing for.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""why not.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is *stated* by the user as their plan. The user is *asking* for methods.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned.
   - The post expresses a desire to find a method, but does not state a specific plan or method the user intends to use. According to the rules, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""What Is a mostly painless way...""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'attempt' because there's no mention of a past action.
   - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. It is asking for information about methods, which is a step towards planning, but the post itself does not contain a *specific plan* formulated or chosen by the user. The user is soliciting information for a plan, rather than stating ""I will use X method"" or ""I have X method ready."" Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation' which includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The instruction to lean towards 'ideation' if unsure about an explicit plan is applied here.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly uses terms like ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""die,"" ""end it with pills,"" and describes the physiological process of an overdose.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The tone is cautionary and informative, aiming to deter. It does not express personal hopelessness, despair, or suicidal intent from the writer.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** It describes a method (overdosing on pills) but as a hypothetical action taken by ""you"" (the reader), not as a plan or preparation by the writer. The purpose is to detail the negative consequences of this method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to the writer's past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""end it with pills.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No, not from the *writer*. The writer is actively discouraging suicide by detailing the unpleasant realities of a specific method. The post's risk assessment must correspond *only* to the person writing the post.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""pills"" and ""overdosing.""
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No, not by the writer. The description of the method is for informational/deterrent purposes, not a personal plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It describes hypothetical future consequences (""You'll feel fine... Then you'll start vomiting..."") of an overdose, framed as a warning. It does not refer to the writer's past attempts or current/future intentions for themselves.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The core rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   The writer of this post is clearly *discouraging* suicide and providing information to deter it. They are not expressing any personal suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts.
    *   **Ideation** requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The writer expresses no such desire.
    *   **Behavior** requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide."" The writer expresses neither.
    *   **Attempt** requires ""describes past attempts at suicide."" The writer describes no such attempts for themselves.
    *   **Indicator:** The definition states, ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" While the post *does* explicitly mention suicide as a topic, it *lacks* any direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings *from the writer*. The writer's intent is preventative, not indicative of personal risk. Therefore, in terms of the *writer's* personal suicide risk, this post indicates the lowest level of risk. The post is about suicide, but the writer is not expressing personal suicidal intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"" strongly implies suicide, especially when coupled with ""no motivation to keep on living"" and ""ill do it when im fed up of this."" ""Do it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide in this context.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""no motivation to keep on living,"" ""fed up of this.""
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. The post explicitly states ""im not ready"" and refers to a future, unspecified time (""in the future,"" ""when im fed up"").
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through clear euphemisms and expressions of not wanting to live (""im positive im gonna do it,"" ""no motivation to keep on living"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no motivation to keep on living.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post indicates a future intention, not a current plan or preparation (""im not ready but im positive im gonna do it the the future,"" ""ill do it when im fed up of this"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings (""no motivation to keep on living"") and future intentions (""im positive im gonna do it the the future,"" ""ill do it when im fed up of this"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/intentions (even if future-oriented).
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The user states they are ""not ready"" and it's a future action.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' as no past attempts are described.
    *   It fits 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The user expresses a desire to end their life in the future, but without a concrete plan or current readiness.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post expresses extreme psychological pain (""psychologically tortured"") and resentment towards parents for having them, implying a wish they hadn't been born, but not a direct wish to die or end their life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I fucking hate my parents"", ""psychologically tortured"", ""couldn't even find the time to care for me"". These indicate significant distress, anger, and feelings of neglect and suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses the suffering of being alive, but not a direct desire to end that life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past events (being born, parents' actions) and the current psychological state (""living a life psychologically tortured""). There are no future intentions related to self-harm or suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly indicates significant psychological distress and unhappiness with life. However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or not wanting to be alive*. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" Since there is no explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die, it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Indicator' is the correct classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The dream content involves ""mass murdering"" and ""slicing up people,"" which are violent acts leading to death, but these are elements of a dream and not related to the poster's own suicidal thoughts or actions. There is no mention of the poster wanting to die or commit suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""severe panic attack,"" ""terrified,"" ""sheer panic,"" ""anxious to sleep,"" ""intense."" These indicate high levels of distress, fear, and anxiety, but not specifically hopelessness or despair related to self-harm or suicide.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the poster's own suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a past dream and the current anxiety and difficulty sleeping resulting from it. It's about seeking advice on how to deal with vivid dreams and anxiety, not about past or current suicidal intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a distressing dream and the resulting anxiety and panic attack.
   - There are clear expressions of emotional distress (panic, terror, anxiety).
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, or any suicidal plans or past attempts by the person writing the post. The violence described is part of a dream, not the poster's intent.
   - According to the definitions, 'Indicator' applies when there are general expressions of distress or sadness but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. This post fits that definition perfectly.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end this suffering"", ""overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"". The ""on purpose"" overdose is a clear past suicide attempt.
   - Emotional indicators: ""fear and despair"", ""suffering"", ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"", ""i don't want to believe theres nothing"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No *new* specific plan or method is mentioned for a *current* action, but a past method (overdose) is described. The phrase ""so i can do it"" implies a desire to act, but without a concrete *new* plan.
   - References to past attempts: ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" This is a direct and explicit description of a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the ""on purpose"" overdose explicitly refers to a suicide attempt. The desire to ""end this suffering"" implies a desire to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? A past method (overdose) is mentioned. No *current* specific method or preparation is detailed for a *new* attempt.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""ive overdosed twice"" is a past event. ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"", ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" refer to current distress and a desire for a future action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""overdosed twice... once on purpose"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly describes a past suicide attempt (""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"").
   - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal again.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""I thought I was getting better,"" ""happy just to be spending time with my partner,"" ""all of a sudden I'm suicidal again,"" ""I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood,"" ""scared to stress him even more."" This indicates a relapse into a suicidal state after a period of improvement, along with distress about the impact on a loved one.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The user mentions running out of meds and not getting a refill, which is a practical issue related to their mental health treatment, not a plan for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past *attempts*. The phrase ""suicidal again"" implies a history of suicidal *thoughts* or *feelings*, but not necessarily past *actions* of attempting suicide.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm suicidal again.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm suicidal again"" directly conveys this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""I'm suicidal again"" indicates a current state of suicidal ideation. The reference to ""getting better"" and ""past few weeks"" refers to a recent past period of improvement.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal again,"" which rules out 'Indicator' as there is a direct mention of suicide.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide mentioned. The mention of medication is about a lack of refill for ongoing treatment, not a means for an attempt. This rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. The word ""again"" refers to the recurrence of suicidal *thoughts/feelings*, not a past *action* of attempting suicide. This rules out 'Attempt'.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die more than ever."" and ""I can't have this life it's too painful."" These are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear there is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan mentioned.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide by hanging"" is an explicit mention of suicide and a method.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""im still not sure"", ""don't want lied to if it is or not, please be honest"" indicates distress, uncertainty, and a search for information related to a specific suicidal act.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""suicide by hanging"" is a specific method. ""ive alr tied the noose"" is a concrete preparation for that method.
    *   References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide by hanging"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not a direct ""I want to die"" statement, the question about the experience of suicide by hanging and the action of tying a noose strongly imply an intent or serious consideration of ending one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""tied the noose"" is a clear sign of preparation, involving a tool (rope) and a specific action towards the method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""ive alr tied the noose"" refers to a current or very recent action. The question ""Is suicide by hanging...?"" and ""im still not sure"" refer to current contemplation and potential future intention. It is not a past completed attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and a specific method (""hanging""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires to not be alive. It includes a specific method (""hanging"") and a concrete preparation (""tied the noose""). This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. ...tools/weapons (e.g. ...ropes) suitable to end ones life...)."" The act of tying a noose is a preparation involving a suitable tool. This rules out 'Ideation' because 'Ideation' is defined as ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"" and instructs to consider 'behavior' if specific ideas of how to commit suicide are present.
    *   The post describes current actions and intentions, not a past completed attempt. Therefore, it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Based on the explicit mention of a method and a concrete preparation (""tied the noose""), 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"".
   - Emotional indicators: Self-loathing (""I'm a pervert""), despair, hopelessness (""I can't help my sexual feelings. I want to die because of them"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Should I kill myself?"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"".
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and feelings (""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"").
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"") but does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation. It also does not describe a past attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i just wanna end it"" strongly implies ending one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i hate my dad"", ""i hate my family so much"", ""i hate him so much"", ""i hate everything"" (intense anger, hatred, despair, hopelessness).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wanna end it"" is a direct expression of wanting to end their life/existence. While not using the specific word ""suicide,"" in the context of extreme distress and ""i hate everything,"" it clearly conveys a desire to cease living.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': In this case, ""end it"" is a sufficiently explicit and strong expression of wanting to end one's life, moving it beyond mere 'indicator'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no plan or method mentioned, so it's not 'behavior'.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""i just wanna end it"" refers to a current desire/future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to end their life (""i just wanna end it"") which fits the definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer"".
   - There is no specific plan mentioned, which rules out 'behavior'.
   - There are no past attempts described, which rules out 'attempt'.
   - It goes beyond general distress and explicitly indicates a desire to end life, thus it's more than an 'indicator'.
   - Therefore, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category.

And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""anyone on the brink of suicide""). The author also describes past feelings of not being able to cope (""felt like I couldn't cope"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""felt like I couldn't cope.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans for suicide are mentioned by the author. The author describes an *alternative* (going hobo/vagrant) to suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The author describes past occasions where they ""felt like I couldn't cope"" and *instead* of suicide, they ""hit the road and went vagrant."" They explicitly state, ""the road has saved me in the past."" This indicates they *avoided* suicide, not attempted it.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The author is presenting an *alternative* to suicide. The author states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the author's own suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past feelings of distress and how the author coped *without* suicide. It also refers to the road being a comfort ""should I ever need it again,"" as an *alternative* to suicide. The author explicitly states their current state: ""I am a functional member of society at the moment."" The post is *not* describing a current suicidal intention or a past suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post mentions ""suicide"" explicitly, but it is *not* an expression of the author's own suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or attempts.
    *   The author states they are ""functional"" and describes past situations where they *avoided* suicide by choosing an alternative.
    *   The post is a supportive message offering an alternative to *others* who might be ""on the brink of suicide,"" drawing on the author's past coping mechanisms.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The author does *not* express this desire.
        *   'Behavior' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts AND also mentions... a plan."" This is not present.
        *   'Attempt' requires ""The content describes past attempts at suicide."" The author describes *avoiding* suicide, not attempting it.
        *   'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" While the word ""suicide"" is present, it's used in a general context for *others* or as a past hypothetical that the author *avoided*. Crucially, there is ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" *from the author*. The author is discussing suicide as a concept but is not expressing their own suicidal state. The risk for the person writing the post is minimal, as they are offering an alternative and stating they are currently functional.

    Therefore, despite the explicit mention of the word ""suicide,"" the post does not convey suicidal intent, ideation, behavior, or attempt from the author. It's a general discussion about coping with distress and an alternative to suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I can't go on anymore,"" ""end it"" (clearly referring to ending life).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My life has been getting worse,"" ""so lonely,"" ""I fucked up my life,"" ""I miss being happy"" – all indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it."" This indicates a decision and a timeframe (""tonight"") but *not* a specific method (e.g., ""I'm going to take pills,"" ""I'm going to jump,"" ""I'm going to use a gun""). The ""drunk"" state is a precursor, not the method itself. No mention of acquiring means or writing notes.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""end it"" in this context is a direct and explicit expression of wanting to end their life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""then end it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., type of weapon, substance, location for jumping) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""tonight"" indicates immediacy but not a concrete plan of *how*.
    *   As per the rule: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" There is no explicit *how*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""tonight... then end it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end life (""end it,"" ""can't go on anymore""), which goes beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits. The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""end it,"" ""can't go on anymore"") but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" There is no specific method or concrete preparation described.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While there's a clear intent and timeframe, there's no ""specific plan like a specific method or preparations taken.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post describes current/future intent, not a past completed action.

Therefore, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, but lacks a specific plan or method, aligning with the definition of Ideation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""successfully end my life"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The question itself implies severe distress and a desire to end life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"" as potential means. The question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" indicates an intention to use these specific substances as a method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""successfully end my life"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the query about the success of ending life implies a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"". These are specific substances intended for a lethal purpose.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The user states they ""have"" the codeine and ""access"" to ibuprofen, indicating possession or immediate availability of the means. The question is about the efficacy of this specific plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""end my life""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond just a desire to die by mentioning specific means (""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"") and asking about their effectiveness for suicide. This constitutes a specific plan or method.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions... a plan to commit suicide"" and ""must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs)"". The mention of codeine and ibuprofen as the intended method fits this definition precisely.
    *   There is no description of a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

191,SMI. How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""commit suicide eventually"" is a direct mention of suicide.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The question ""How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?"" indicates a distressing thought process and a sense of inevitability regarding suicide.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned. It's a hypothetical future event.
   - Check for references to past attempts: There are no references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""commit suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" is a direct expression of a suicidal thought or belief about future action.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan, method, or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a future intention or belief (""will probably commit suicide eventually""). It is not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" and expresses a thought about it (""will probably commit suicide eventually"") without detailing any specific plan or method. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It does not fit 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It does not fit 'Behavior' because there is no plan. It does not fit 'Attempt' because it refers to a future possibility, not a past action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" is present. This explicitly mentions ""die"" in the context of the poster's own life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""abusive ex"", ""mental health stuff"", ""not okay right now"" indicate distress. However, the overall tone shifts to ""hopeful thought"" and ""i hope i can have that one day. and even if i'm by myself for the rest of the life, i can be okay.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""die"" is explicitly mentioned (""maybe i don't need to die""). This phrase implies that the thought of dying was present and considered, even if the poster is now moving away from that thought. It acknowledges the existence of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" is not a *current* expression of wanting to die, but it is an explicit acknowledgment that the idea of dying was a consideration. It directly references suicidal ideation, even if the current sentiment is hopeful. According to the definition of 'ideation', it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" implies that such a desire or thought was present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post discusses current feelings (""not okay right now"") and future hopes (""i hope i can have that one day"", ""i can be okay""). The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" refers to a current or recent internal state where dying was considered, and the poster is now reflecting on moving past that thought.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** The post *does* contain an explicit mention of ""die"" in the context of the poster's life, which goes beyond general distress or a vague feeling about death. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" is considered, but ""die"" is explicit enough to move beyond 'indicator'.
    *   **Ideation:** The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" explicitly references the concept of ending one's life, implying that this thought was present. It fits ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings"" without any specific plan. The fact that the person is moving away from the thought doesn't negate that the thought was present and is being explicitly addressed in the post.
    *   **Behavior:** There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or self-harming behavior.
    *   **Attempt:** There is no description of a past suicide attempt.

    Therefore, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category because the post explicitly mentions ""die"" in a self-referential context, indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts, but without any plan or past attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i don't wanna die rn"", ""suicidal thoughts are always there"", ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"", ""what is the worst thing that can happen to me"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""i just wanna be calm rn because im bored"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taking 3 xanax pills"". The user explicitly asks about the lethality of this specific action and states ""i will do it anyway"".
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts are always there"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The user states ""i don't wanna die rn"", but immediately follows with an inquiry about the lethality of Xanax and the presence of suicidal thoughts. This indicates a complex relationship, but the core issue is the presence of suicidal thoughts and the consideration of a specific action in that context.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""taking 3 xanax pills"". This is a specific substance and quantity.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The user states ""i will do it anyway"", indicating an intent to carry out the action of taking the pills, despite being told not to. The question about lethality indicates an exploration of this specific method. This is more than just vague ideation; it's an inquiry into a specific means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings and future intentions (""i will do it anyway""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal thoughts"") and a specific method is being discussed/intended.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post goes beyond just thoughts. It includes a specific method (""3 xanax pills"") and an expressed intent to use it (""i will do it anyway""), along with an inquiry about its potential lethality. This moves it beyond mere ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts are always there"") and mentions a specific plan/method (""taking 3 xanax pills""). The user is asking about the lethality of this specific method and states ""i will do it anyway"", indicating intent to act. Even if the dose isn't typically lethal, the mention of a specific substance and quantity as a method, coupled with the intent to take it, aligns with the definition of 'behavior' (""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs)"").
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described as having occurred.

    The user is not just thinking about suicide, but actively considering and intending to use a specific substance as a method, and inquiring about its effects. This constitutes a ""plan to commit suicide"" even if the plan is brief or the method might not be effective.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" which is a direct mention of self-harm. It also explicitly states ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself"", which is a direct mention of suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""shitface"", ""monster"", ""human garbage"", ""hurt my friend"", ""don't know what to do"". These indicate severe self-loathing, guilt, distress, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user asks for places to self-harm, which is a query for a method related to self-harm, but not a specific plan for *suicide*. The statement ""i will wait until I can kill myself"" expresses an *intention* to commit suicide, but does not specify *how* (method) or *preparations*.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i will wait until I can kill myself"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for *suicide* is mentioned. The question about self-harm locations is for self-harm, not a suicide method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations for *suicide* are mentioned.
    *   The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Since there's no specific plan for *suicide* (method, means, location), despite the strong intention, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""i will wait until I can kill myself"" refers to a future intention.
    *   ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed"" refers to a current query for future self-harm.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and feelings (""i will wait until I can kill myself"") and a desire to end one's life.
    *   However, it does *not* include any specific plan (method, location, means) for committing suicide. The self-harm query is distinct from a suicide plan in the provided definitions.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It does not fit 'Behavior' because there is no explicit suicide plan. It does not fit 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It does not fit 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Im probably going to kill myself soon."" ""wish i wasn't even born""
   - Emotional indicators: ""feeling a really strong urge"", ""dont care"", ""dont make any effort to keep me around"", ""life is fucking stupid"" (indicating hopelessness, despair, feeling unwanted).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Im probably going to kill myself soon."" and ""i just wish i wasn't even born to begin with.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no explicit plan is mentioned, this points towards 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Im probably going to kill myself soon."", ""I've been feeling a really strong urge to lately"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide (""kill myself"") and a desire to not be alive. This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., tools, locations, notes). This rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""plummet to the ground"", ""corpse"" are direct references to dying/death by suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""so tempted"", ""guilt or fear"" indicates strong internal conflict and a serious consideration of the act.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" describes a specific method (jumping) and a specific location (highest floor).
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, the phrase ""plummet to the ground"" resulting in a ""corpse"" is an explicit description of a suicidal act.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" is a direct expression of a desire to die by this method.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" is a specific method (jumping) and a specific location (highest floor/building).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No explicit signs of preparation (like notes, acquiring means) beyond the thought of going to the location. However, the *mention* of a specific location and method is sufficient for 'Behavior'.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** In this case, the method and location are quite explicit, removing uncertainty.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""so tempted to just go..."" indicates a current temptation and a potential future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"").
    *   It also mentions a specific plan/method: ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground."" This includes a specific location (""highest floor"") and a specific method (""plummet to the ground""), which fits the definition of 'Behavior' (""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from)"").
    *   It does not describe a past attempt.
    *   It is more than just vague ideation because of the specific method and location.

Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

   - Emotional indicators: The user is contemplating suicide as a consequence of hurting their boyfriend, suggesting distress, guilt, or a desire to alleviate perceived suffering (theirs or his).

This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""get the nerve to jump"", ""someone took their life the same way"", ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"". Explicitly mentions the act of jumping to end life and discusses wanting to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I can never get the nerve to jump"", ""Trying to work up the nerve"", ""I can't help it"", ""hoping I'll gain the courage"", ""maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care."" Shows internal struggle, ambivalence, and a cry for help.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage?"", ""get the nerve to jump"". This specifies a method (jumping) and a location (hospital parking garage ledge). The act of ""standing there. Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve"" indicates active preparation and being in the act of contemplating/attempting the method, even if the final action hasn't occurred.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""6 years ago someone took their life the same way,"" but this refers to *another person's* past attempt, not the poster's. The poster explicitly states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump,"" indicating no personal past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""get the nerve to jump"" and ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped,"" clearly referring to ending one's life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"" and the entire context of standing on a ledge to ""gain the courage"" to jump implies a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage"" and ""Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve."" This is not just a thought; it's physically being in a suitable location with the intent to act, which constitutes preparation and a form of behavior. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""suitable locations (e.g. ...buildings to jump off from)"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current and ongoing actions and intentions: ""How does no one notice when I'm standing..."", ""I'll stand there. Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve."" The reference to someone else's past attempt is contextual, not about the poster's own past actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONing:**
    *   **Indicator:** No, because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are specific plans/actions.
    *   **Ideation:** No, because the post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires. It describes specific actions (standing on the ledge) in a specific location, with a specific method (jumping), indicating preparation and engagement in the suicidal process, even if the final act hasn't been completed. The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** Yes, this fits. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""wanting to die"", ""gain the courage to jump"") and clearly mentions a plan (""to jump"") with a specific method and a specific location (""the ledge of a hospital parking garage""). The act of ""standing there"" for an hour, ""trying to work up the nerve,"" constitutes a preparation and an exhibition of behavior directly related to the suicidal plan. This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' which includes ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken... suitable locations (e.g. ...buildings to jump off from).""
    *   **Attempt:** No, the post explicitly states, ""I can never get the nerve to jump,"" and ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped,"" indicating that a concrete past attempt by the poster has not occurred. The mention of someone else's past attempt does not classify the *poster's* risk as 'Attempt'.

I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""more dead inside"" is present, but it's a metaphorical expression of emotional numbness or despair, not a literal mention of death or suicide. There are no explicit mentions of suicide or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all,"" ""more dead inside,"" ""Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything."" These indicate feelings of abandonment, betrayal, deep hopelessness, despair, and emotional exhaustion.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expressions like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive."" The phrase ""Im done with everything"" expresses extreme despair and a desire for current suffering to end, but it does not explicitly state a desire to end life itself.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The post expresses severe distress and hopelessness, but it lacks the explicit mention of suicide or a desire to die as required for 'ideation'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there is no planning mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and a present state of despair (""Im done with everything"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   Based on the analysis, the post contains significant general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of giving up (""Im done with everything""). However, it *lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide* or a direct desire to not be alive. The phrase ""more dead inside"" is metaphorical. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post perfectly fits the definition of 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""death,"" but the act of ""jumping off"" a window with the hope of ""doing it soon"" strongly implies an intent to end one's life.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""less scary,"" ""getting more courage,"" ""hopefully I can do it soon"" indicate a struggle with fear but a clear intent to carry out the action.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window"" clearly identify a method and location. ""Trees and mud below"" adds detail to the perceived landing area. ""Getting more courage"" and ""hopefully I can do it soon"" indicate current mental preparation and a desire for imminent action.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the description of jumping from a window with the hope of doing it soon is a direct expression of an intent to end one's life. The act itself is the means to achieve the desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump off,"" ""jump out of my bedroom window."" This is a concrete method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""Getting more courage"" is a form of mental preparation. ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicates a current intention to act on the plan. The mention of ""trees and mud below"" shows consideration of the specific environment for the act.
    *   The plan is explicit: method (jumping), location (bedroom window), and temporal intent (soon).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I can jump off,"" ""getting more courage,"" ""hopefully I can do it soon"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post goes beyond general distress and clearly describes a specific action intended to end life.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is a desire to not be alive, the post contains specific ideas of *how* to commit suicide (jumping from a bedroom window) and an expressed intention to act on it soon. The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits perfectly. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (implied by the described action) and clearly mentions a plan to commit suicide (jumping from a bedroom window) with a specific method and location. It also shows a current intention to act (""hopefully I can do it soon"").
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. This describes a future plan, not a past completed action.

   - Emotional indicators: ""low energy,"" ""depression hits really hard,"" ""hate talking about myself,"" ""waste their time.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""writing suicide notes"" is a direct mention of a preparation for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit past attempts are described. The phrase ""next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" implies a recurring or current tendency, not a past completed action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""writing suicide notes.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly, but ""writing suicide notes"" is a strong implicit expression of suicidal intent or ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" is explicitly listed in the 'Behavior' definition as a sign of preparation (""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" indicates a current or recurring response to severe depression, suggesting ongoing or future potential for suicidal behavior, rather than a single past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit mention of suicide (""writing suicide notes""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The phrase ""writing suicide notes"" is specifically cited in the definition of 'Behavior' as a form of ""preparations taken."" While no specific *method* is detailed, the act of writing suicide notes is a clear preparatory step towards suicide.
   - The definition for 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". This fits the post's content directly.
   - It does not describe a past completed action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires (Ideation) by describing a concrete preparatory action (writing notes).

No one cares not even me if i get the things i sought and need its okay but if i dont i suddenly get all depressed there are people suffering from medical depression on this sub and you think your petty problems are enough to warrant sympathy from suicide watchers idk maybe i just need attention yes its all a ruse for attention. People dying is funny hope that asshole dies hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""hope i die"" is a direct expression of a desire to die. ""People dying is funny"" is a general statement, but ""hope i die"" is specific to the user.
   - Emotional indicators: ""suffering mentally"", ""get all depressed"", ""No one cares"", ""fuck me fuck da world"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and anger.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""hope i die"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""hope i die"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die (""hope i die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, which rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""hope i die"" perfectly fits ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" without a plan.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:** The post states ""Ah. Just cut to deep fuck"".
    *   ""cut to deep"" indicates an act of self-harm, specifically cutting.
    *   ""fuck"" indicates distress or pain.
    *   There is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or wanting to end one's life.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan for suicide.
    *   It describes a past action (""Just cut"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? The act of ""cut"" is mentioned, but it's a description of an *action* that has occurred, not a *plan* for suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post describes self-harm, but not a *plan for suicide*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""Just cut to deep"" refers to an event that has recently happened. It's a past action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt:** The post describes a past action (""cut to deep""). However, the definition for 'Attempt' specifies ""past attempts at suicide."" While self-harm can be a suicide attempt, the post does not explicitly state that the cutting was an *attempt to commit suicide*. It's described as self-harm.
    *   **Ideation:** The post does not include any explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, nor a desire to not be alive.
    *   **Behavior:** The definition states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts *and also* mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide *or exhibits self-harming behavior*.""
        *   The post *does* exhibit self-harming behavior (""Just cut to deep"").
        *   However, it *does not* include ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts."" The definition uses ""and also,"" implying both conditions (suicidal thoughts AND plan/self-harm) must be met for it to be classified as 'Behavior'. Since explicit suicidal thoughts are absent, this category does not fit.
    *   **Indicator:** The definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide."" This is true for the given post. ""There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" While ""cut to deep"" is more than general distress, the absence of explicit suicidal thoughts or intent means it falls into this category based on the strict definitions provided. The self-harm is a serious act, but without explicit suicidal ideation or a stated suicide attempt, it aligns with the 'Indicator' definition which covers content lacking explicit suicide mentions.

Given the strict definitions, especially the ""and also"" clause for 'Behavior' and the requirement for explicit suicide mentions for 'Ideation' and 'Attempt', the post, despite describing self-harm, fits best into 'Indicator' as it lacks explicit suicidal intent or mention of suicide.

You're an attention hungry piece of shit that feeds off the misery of others",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post does not explicitly use these words directly from the user's perspective. However, the user is reacting strongly to phrases like ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"", which are common interventions for someone contemplating suicide. This context is highly indicative of a suicide-related discussion.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme anger, frustration, cynicism, and a feeling of being misunderstood (""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, not directly by the user stating ""I am suicidal"" or ""I want to die."" The user is quoting and reacting to *others'* explicit mentions of suicide prevention.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No, not directly from the user's own words. The user expresses profound frustration with external attempts to intervene, implying they are in a situation where such interventions are relevant.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** The user's *own* language does not explicitly state suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. While the *context* is clearly about suicide due to the quoted phrases, the user's direct expression is one of anger and frustration towards others, not an explicit statement of their own suicidal feelings. Given the rule to lean towards 'indicator' if explicit mention is unclear, this point is critical.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current frustration. No past attempts mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress and anger.
    *   The content is a strong reaction to suicide prevention messages (""don't do it!""), which places the user in a clear context of suicidal ideation or crisis.
    *   However, the definition of 'ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The user's post, while heavily implying a suicidal context through their reaction to others' words, does not contain a direct, explicit statement from the user themselves about wanting to die or having suicidal thoughts.
    *   The definition of 'indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. ... When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   Because the user's *own* statement does not explicitly express suicidal thoughts or a desire to die, despite the clear suicidal *context* implied by their reaction to others' comments, it fits the 'indicator' category more precisely based on the strict definitions and the ""when in doubt"" rule. The post *indicates* a suicidal context and distress, but lacks the user's *explicit expression* of suicidal thoughts.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now,"" and ""they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time."" It also mentions ""want to justify dying"" and ""thinking about partially planning to die."" The user describes themselves as ""self destructive.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""guilty,"" ""terrible,"" ""anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse,"" ""fear I only hurt,"" ""terribly anxious nihilistic.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips."" While it mentions ""partially planning to die,"" this is immediately qualified by the lack of strong methods, indicating the planning is not concrete or detailed. No specific tools, locations, or substances are mentioned. No preparations (like notes or acquiring means) are described.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""justify dying,"" ""thinking about partially planning to die.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""want to justify dying.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post explicitly states, ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The phrase ""partially planning to die"" suggests the *concept* of planning is present in their thoughts, but it lacks the specificity (methods, preparations) required for the 'Behavior' category. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" This is not met. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current and ongoing intentions/thoughts (""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now,"" ""thinking about it most of the time for the past few months,"" ""every single day I feel terrible,"" ""I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post clearly expresses ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which fits 'Ideation'. While ""partially planning to die"" is mentioned, the crucial part is the lack of ""any specific plan to commit suicide"" or ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)"" which are required for 'Behavior'. The user explicitly states they ""don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips."" Therefore, it aligns with 'Ideation'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness, despair, feeling useless (""ugly useless stupid girl"", ""no degree, no partner, no job, no reason to keep going""), feeling like life is a ""bullshit game"" and a ""scam.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user states, ""i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This describes a specific method (""hang myself"") and a specific location/means of getting there and finding the spot.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The user mentions, ""ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears."" This indicates past suicidal *ideation* or thoughts, but not a past *attempt* (a concrete action).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot"". This constitutes a specific plan involving a method and a location.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The plan (""I've been thinking I could just drive out... and hang myself"") refers to current thoughts and future intentions. The mention of being ""too scared to end it"" in the past refers to past ideation, not a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""better off dead"", ""no reason to keep going""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   Crucially, the post includes a specific plan: ""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself."" This explicitly details a method (""hang myself"") and a location/means (""drive out into the mountains"", ""find a nice little spot""). This level of detail about a plan moves it beyond 'ideation' and into 'behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a concrete past action of suicide, only past thoughts about it. Therefore, it is not 'attempt'.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide...

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"" multiple times (""unbelievably suicidal"", ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"", ""recovered from being suicidal"").
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what to do anymore"", ""it's just not working"", ""so so so unbelievably suicidal"", ""tired of all of it"", ""hard to have any hope or motivation to go on"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and chronic suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. The post details efforts to improve mental health but no plans for self-harm or suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned. The post refers to past *thoughts* and *feelings* (""Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts. Its supposed to get better but its been years."") but not past *actions* or attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the phrase ""I'm just tired of all of it"" combined with the constant suicidal thoughts strongly implies a desire for the suffering to end, which is consistent with ideation. The explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" is sufficient.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

   - Emotional indicators: ""fucked up self,"" ""depression and anxiety,"" ""scared they'll just think it's an excuse for me to be lazy,"" ""literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore,"" ""idk what to do."" These indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and lack of motivation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post is about needing therapy and the difficulty in obtaining it.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a desire to ""fix my fucked up self"" through therapy, not a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and a current problem (difficulty accessing therapy for depression/anxiety). There are no references to past events related to suicide or future intentions of suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses significant distress, depression, anxiety, and a feeling of being ""fucked up,"" along with a lack of motivation. This aligns with ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness.""
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or any plan/attempt.
   - According to the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""

213,i watch a lot of crime videos on youtube and they just be giving me ideas. i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that. butttt i just saw a video about a woman who killed her husband by putting eye drops in his beverages and i'd be lying if i said that didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method 🧍‍♀️. *sigh*. i wish i wasn't like this :(,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suppress my suicidal thoughts"", ""new suicide method"", ""killed her husband"" (as a method inspiration).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""i wish i wasn't like this :("".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""a video about a woman who killed her husband by putting eye drops in his beverages and i'd be lying if i said that didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method"". This identifies a specific *method*, but it's presented as an ""idea"" that was ""given"" to the user, not a plan actively being formulated or prepared for.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"", ""new suicide method"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and seeking ""new suicide method"" implies a desire to not be alive, even if there's internal resistance (""i really don't want to have to do that"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""putting eye drops in his beverages"" as a ""new suicide method"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, there are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring eye drops, writing a note). The post states it ""didn't give me an *idea* of a new suicide method,"" which emphasizes the conceptualization of the method rather than active planning or preparation. The user also states they ""try to suppress"" these thoughts.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, while a method is identified, it is framed as an ""idea"" rather than a concrete plan the person is moving towards.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Current/future intentions: The ""new suicide method"" refers to a current thought about a potential future action.
    *   Past events: No past attempts described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Not 'Attempt' because no past attempts are described.
    *   Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and a specific *method* that has come to mind (""an idea of a new suicide method""). However, it lacks any indication of *planning* or *preparation* for this method. The phrasing ""gave me an idea"" and the user's stated attempt to ""suppress my suicidal thoughts"" suggest that it remains at the level of a thought or concept, not an active plan. According to the definitions, 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning"" or ""preparations taken."" The mention of a method as an ""idea"" without any steps towards execution or preparation aligns more closely with 'Ideation', especially given the rule: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

214,"I think I've come to realize I'm the common denominator in all of my problems. A month ago I wrote a suicide note.

Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicide note,"" ""free myself of my problems,"" ""decided how and when,"" ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Self-blame (""common denominator in all of my problems""), frustration (""sabotaged myself,"" ""can't even fucking free myself""), longing for a past feeling (""felt so calm then,"" ""coax the feeling back out,"" ""rush of calm"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted,"" ""Planned everything out,"" ""Picked a time and place."" These are explicit descriptions of planning and preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a past *plan* that was ""sabotaged,"" not a past *attempt* (concrete action).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide note.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by ""free myself of my problems,"" ""decided how and when,"" and ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific tool, but ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place"" and ""wrote a suicide note"" are clear indicators of explicit planning and preparation. The definition of 'Behavior' explicitly mentions ""suicide note"" and ""preparations taken.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes a past event of planning (""A month ago I wrote a suicide note,"" ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself."").
    *   It also expresses a current desire to re-experience that state and potentially act on it (""I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time""). This indicates current ideation with a desire to engage in planning/action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** No, suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there is clear planning described.
    *   **Ideation:** The post goes beyond mere thoughts; it details specific past planning and preparation (suicide note, time, place).
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (current desire to ""do it this time"") and explicitly mentions a plan and preparations taken in the past (""wrote a suicide note,"" ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place""). The current desire to ""coax the feeling back out"" and ""do it this time"" links the past planning to a present inclination towards re-engaging in such behavior. The presence of a ""suicide note"" is a key element for 'Behavior' as per the definition.
    *   **Attempt:** No, the post describes a past *plan* that was ""sabotaged,"" not a concrete *action* taken. The definition requires a concrete action to have happened.

The post describes past preparatory actions (writing a note, planning time/place) and a current desire to re-engage in that behavior, which aligns strongly with the 'Behavior' definition.

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone."" This is a strong implicit reference to their non-existence or death. There are no explicit mentions of ""suicide"" or ""self-harm.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""suffering,"" ""don't feel it will ever end,"" ""utter hell,"" ""alone and forgotten,"" ""just a stain upon the world,"" ""crying,"" ""forsaken,"" ""pain,"" ""rotten pit,"" ""outcast,"" ""hanging on by threads,"" ""endless pain,"" ""fading memory."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" implies a contemplation of their absence/death and a feeling of inconsequence. However, it is not a direct statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive.""
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** The instruction states, ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Since the words ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or explicit desire to ""end my life"" are not present, and the statement ""if I were gone"" is an implicit contemplation rather than an explicit desire, this leans towards 'indicator' based on the strict definition.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** Not applicable as there is no plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current feelings and ongoing struggles (""I am suffering,"" ""I feel so alone,"" ""I am hanging on by threads""). The phrase ""if I were gone"" refers to a hypothetical future state.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound hopelessness, despair, and feelings of worthlessness (""just a stain upon the world,"" ""fading memory""). The phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" indicates a contemplation of their non-existence.
    *   However, the definition of 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The definition of 'Indicator' is very strict: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   Since the post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" ""end my life,"" or a direct statement of wanting to not be alive, despite the strong emotional distress and implicit contemplation of non-existence, it falls under 'Indicator' due to the strict rule requiring *explicit* mention for 'Ideation'. The post describes severe distress and thoughts that are *indicators* of suicide risk, but not explicit ideation as per the given definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to die"", ""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself"", ""I'm done with life"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""all I cause is pain"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""So Tuesday, I'm either going to slit my wrist and get into my broken car or hang myself from a tree"". This includes a specific timeframe (Tuesday) and specific methods (slit wrist, use of car, hanging from a tree).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""want to die"", ""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""want to die"", ""I'm done with life"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slit my wrist"", ""get into my broken car"" (implying a method using the car), ""hang myself from a tree"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""So Tuesday, I'm either going to..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses a desire to die and explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond just suicidal thoughts by detailing specific methods (""slit my wrist"", ""hang myself from a tree"", ""get into my broken car"") and a timeframe (""Tuesday""). This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition which requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". It explicitly states ""a specific method or preparations taken"".
   - There is no description of a *past* completed action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better.

Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there."" This is a direct mention of suicidal feelings/thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""worried,"" ""paranoid,"" ""10x more suicidal.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states regarding the *past* hotline call, ""didn't have a method or anything."" No current plan or method is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: The post describes a past *intervention* (cops called, psych ward stay) that resulted from a hotline call, but it explicitly states the user ""didn't have a method or anything"" at that time, meaning it was not a past *attempt*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""It made me 10x more suicidal.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""10x more suicidal"" indicates a strong presence of suicidal thoughts or feelings, even if not a direct ""I want to die right now."" It implies a desire to not be alive or a strong inclination towards ending one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post explicitly denies a method for the past situation (""didn't have a method or anything"") and mentions no method for the current situation.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event (the psych ward stay, the previous hotline call) and current/future intentions (seeking a new hotline, current state of being ""10x more suicidal""). The ""10x more suicidal"" is a present state.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""10x more suicidal"").
   - **Ideation:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" thoughts/feelings (""It made me 10x more suicidal"") and the user is seeking a hotline due to ongoing distress, which implies a desire to not be alive or strong suicidal thoughts. Crucially, there is *no specific plan or method* mentioned. This aligns perfectly with the definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because no specific plan, method, or preparations are mentioned. The post explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" for the past situation, and no current plan is detailed.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post describes a past *intervention* (psych ward stay) but explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything,"" meaning it was not a past suicide *attempt*.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"" in a quote, and the poster is clearly reacting to this accusation in relation to their own feelings. They state, ""They won't believe it until I die,"" which is a direct reference to their own potential death, implying suicidal thoughts. They also say, ""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP,"" indicating a struggle against suicidal urges and a cry for assistance.
   - Emotional indicators: Rage, anger, frustration, despair, feeling misunderstood, neglected, and unheard.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used, and the phrase ""until I die"" directly relates to the poster's own potential death, in the context of their struggle for help regarding their feelings. The entire post is a defense against the invalidation of their *own* suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the phrases ""trying to fucking hold on to whatever the hell I have left"" and ""They won't believe it until I die"" strongly imply a current struggle with suicidal thoughts and the potential for giving up. The context is that the poster is experiencing suicidal feelings and seeking help for them.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and struggles (""I'm trying to hold on,"" ""I still need help"") and a potential future outcome (""until I die"") if their current struggles are not addressed. It does not describe past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is too mild because suicide/dying is explicitly mentioned in relation to the poster's own struggle and feelings.
   - 'Behavior' is incorrect because no specific plan or method is mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect because no past attempts are described.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (implied through the struggle to ""hold on"" and the ""until I die"" statement in response to being dismissed as attention-seeking for their suicidal feelings), but without any specific plan.

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool/location) is mentioned, but specific preparations are: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"" are clear signs of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and future intentions (""feel like killing my self every day"", ""Everythings ready"", ""this might be my final good bye"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the reference to ""gave it a chance"" refers to life, not a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""feel like killing my self every day""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere thoughts by stating that preparations have been made (""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done""). This aligns with the 'behavior' definition which includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable to end ones life)"".
   - It does not describe a past completed suicide attempt, so it is not 'attempt'.
   - The presence of preparations distinguishes it from 'ideation'.

I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting. I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog. I haven't talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks i'm ok. I'm not though. I don't know what to do anymore. I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""kms"" (kill myself) multiple times (""I'm going to kms"", ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon"", ""I'm about to kms"", ""I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon""). It also states ""I can't stop cutting,"" which is a clear mention of self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: High levels of distress, hopelessness, and feeling trapped are evident (""I'm holding it all in and i'm about to explode"", ""I feel like I can't keep it to myself anymore"", ""I'm not ok"", ""I don't know what to do anymore"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""I'm not sure when but I know I am"" and ""just not yet though I can't leave my dog."" This indicates intent but explicitly states there is no specific time or method chosen yet. No specific tools, locations, or preparations (like notes) are mentioned for suicide. The cutting is mentioned as an ongoing behavior, not a planned method for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: There is no mention of past *suicide attempts*. The cutting is current/ongoing self-harm.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""kms"", ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon."" and ""I'm about to kms"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for *suicide* is mentioned. The post explicitly states ""I'm not sure when"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation for suicide are mentioned. The cutting is described as an ongoing behavior, not a preparation for a suicide attempt.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""going to kms soon"", ""about to kms"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past suicide attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to end one's life (""I'm going to kms"", ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon.""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - However, the post explicitly states ""I'm not sure when"" and ""just not yet"", indicating a lack of a specific plan (method, time, location, or preparations). While self-harm (cutting) is mentioned, it's not presented as the specific plan for suicide.
   - According to the definitions, 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Since no specific plan is detailed, and the rule states ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", 'Behavior' is not the correct classification.
   - There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation', as it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and desires without a specific plan.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""wanna kill myself"", ""killing myself"", ""suicide notes"", ""if I do it"", ""my death"", and ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong emotions of anger, defiance, resentment, hopelessness, and a desire to cause pain to others (""ruin their lives"", ""burden of my death"", ""hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash"". This is a direct reference to a preparation. It also mentions a specific method: ""shoot myself on the spot"" (though phrased as a wish, it identifies a method).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past *attempts* (e.g., overdose, physical self-harm leading to injury) are described. The ""suicide notes"" are preparations, not an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""wanna kill myself"", ""killing myself"", ""suicide notes"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""wanna kill myself"", ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""shoot myself on the spot"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash"". The definition of 'Behavior' explicitly lists ""suicide note"" as a form of ""preparations taken"".
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, the mention of ""suicide notes"" is a clear sign of preparation, which falls under 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current intentions (""wanna kill myself even more"", ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"") and recent past preparations/discoveries (""suicide notes I threw away"", ""Family found out"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are specific preparations.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post goes beyond just thoughts/feelings and includes a concrete sign of preparation (suicide notes) and a specific method (shooting). The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""wanna kill myself"") and clearly mentions ""preparations taken"" in the form of ""suicide notes I threw away"". The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". The mention of ""shoot myself on the spot"" also points to a specific method.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past concrete suicide attempt is described. The notes are preparation, not an attempt.
    The presence of suicide notes, explicitly stated as having been found, is a strong indicator of 'Behavior' as per the definition.

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Think I'm going to OD today."" (OD implies overdose, a form of self-harm/suicide). ""popping all of them at once and hope for the best"" (desire to end life). ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I can't feel anything right now and it's all I can think about."" ""Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this."" (suggests pervasive despair).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"" (specific means/substances). ""going to OD today."" ""popping all of them at once"" (specific method).
   - References to past attempts: No past *attempts* are described, only past *thinking about suicide* (ideation).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Think I'm going to OD today."" and ""popping all of them at once and hope for the best"" clearly express a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""OD today"" and ""popping all of them at once"" using specific listed medications. This is a clear method and means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The user states ""I have a month's prescription for..."" which indicates possession of the means.
   - This explicitly identifies a plan/method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Think I'm going to OD today."" refers to a current/future intention. ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"" refers to past ideation, but the core risk is current.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to die with a plan.
   - Not 'Ideation' because the post includes a specific plan/method (""OD today"", ""popping all of them at once"", listing specific medications). The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a *current plan* (""going to OD today""), not a *past completed action*. The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide.""

   Based on the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts and a specific plan involving means (medications) and method (overdose), 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category.

225,"Sorry. I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up. Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you to those who brought any light into my life. The end is the only thing that feels right now. Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson. I'm sorry I wasn't a better person.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" strongly implies an end to life, especially when coupled with the farewells and apologies. While ""suicide"" is not explicitly stated, ""the end"" in this context carries strong suicidal implications.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Sorry,"" ""nothing left,"" ""completely used up,"" ""sorry I wasn't a better person."" These indicate deep despair, hopelessness, and a sense of finality. The goodbyes (""Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson"") reinforce a farewell tone.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. No specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a formal note beyond the post itself) are detailed.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" is a very strong, albeit indirect, expression of a desire to end one's life. Combined with the farewells and apologies, it conveys a clear intent to cease existing. This moves beyond vague distress and into explicit suicidal thought, even without the direct word ""suicide."" It fits the 'Ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" or ""stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The post itself reads like a final message or goodbye, which could be seen as a form of preparation. However, the 'Behavior' definition requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable to end ones life, suitable locations...)."" The post does not describe *how* the end will occur, nor does it mention acquiring means. It's a statement of intent and farewell, not a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions (""The end is the only thing that feels right now"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death. ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" combined with the valedictory tone (apologies, goodbyes to loved ones) constitutes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to not be alive any longer, even if the word ""suicide"" isn't used. It's not just ""vague feeling about dying or death"" but a clear statement of an impending ""end"" that ""feels right."" Therefore, it's stronger than 'Indicator'.
    *   **Ideation vs. Behavior:** There is no specific plan, method, or concrete preparation mentioned (e.g., specific means, location). The post is a farewell expressing suicidal thoughts, but not detailing *how* it will happen. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies.
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempts are described.

Based on this, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end, but without any specific plan or method. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I was already suicidal"", ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel so bad"", ""feel terrible terrible"", ""mind is going crazy"", ""incredibly overwhelmed"", ""can't even cry.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific method. No explicit preparations are mentioned, but a specific method is.
   - References to past attempts: ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" refers to a past state of mind/feelings, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I was already suicidal.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" clearly expresses a desire to end consciousness/life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a specific method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (like acquiring a tool, writing a note) are mentioned.
   - Rule: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" However, ""cutting my god damn throat"" is a very explicit and specific method, not just a vague idea.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I was already suicidal"" refers to a past state. ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" refers to a current intense desire/intention.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a specific method is described.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post contains a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat""). The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - 'Behavior' fits because the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I was already suicidal"", ""all I want to do is shut every thought down"") and mentions a specific plan/method (""cutting my god damn throat""). This falls under ""a specific method"" suitable to end one's life.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because it describes current thoughts and desires, not a past completed action. The mention of ""I was already suicidal"" refers to a past mental state, not a past suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill yourself"" within the context of a quote.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The poster is not expressing their own emotions related to suicide. They are asking for information about a quote.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, within the quote.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the person writing the post. The post is about a quote, not the poster's personal feelings or intentions. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"". Therefore, the explicit mention of suicide is not *by* the poster as an expression of their own state.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a quote the user ""recently stumbled upon"" and is asking for more information about it. It's an informational query, not an expression of personal intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the crucial point is that the suicide risk must correspond *only to the person writing the post*. The poster is not expressing suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts. They are merely inquiring about a quote that contains themes of suicide. Because the post *from the perspective of the writer* lacks any explicit expression concerning their own suicidal thoughts or feelings, it falls under 'Indicator'. The explicit mention of suicide is part of the quote being discussed, not the poster's own state.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""i want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore."" These are strong expressions of a desire to die. ""Join my dog"" implies joining a deceased pet, thus referring to death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i'm not happy anymore"", ""i don't care if people call me selfish"", ""never been truly happy"", ""my life so difficult"", ""i give up on everything"", ""endless loop"", ""my life will never get better"", ""i've accepted that"". These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., how to ""leave earth"" or ""join my dog"") is mentioned. No preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""i always end up wanting to die"" which refers to a recurring *feeling/desire*, not a past *attempt*. There is no description of a concrete past action of self-harm or suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrases ""want to leave earth,"" ""wanting to die,"" and ""ready to join my dog"" are explicit expressions of a desire to end one's life.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, clearly.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No. ""Leave earth"" or ""join my dog"" are not specific methods.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** There is no explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post primarily refers to current feelings and intentions: ""i want to leave earth"", ""i'm not happy anymore"", ""i'm ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore."" The ""endless loop"" refers to recurring feelings of wanting to die, not past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""want to leave earth"", ""wanting to die"", ""ready to join my dog"").
    *   It does *not* contain any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
    *   It does *not* describe a past suicide attempt.

He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" It also mentions ""grandpa passed away,"" ""losing her father,"" ""his passing,"" and ""die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My mom is already doing awful,"" ""couldn't add the loss of a child,"" ""don't ever want to make my mother cry."" There's also a shift to ""gained a sort of appreciation for my life.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""I was going to kill myself"" but *does not* mention any specific method, tool, location, or preparation (e.g., ""how"" they were going to do it).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are described. The phrase ""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself"" refers to a past *intention* or *plan*, not a past *action* or *attempt*. The post then states, ""Now, I know I can't do that,"" indicating the past plan is no longer active.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""I was going to kill myself.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, the phrase ""I was going to kill myself"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life. Even though the immediate plan is now off (""Now, I know I can't do that""), the explicit mention of past suicidal intent is present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   The post describes a past intention to commit suicide but lacks any detail about *how* it was to be done.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The phrase ""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit"" refers to a *past intention/plan*.
    *   ""Now, I know I can't do that"" refers to a current decision to *not* act on that past intention.
    *   ""His passing has saved my life for the time being"" refers to the current state. The post describes a past suicidal ideation that has been put on hold due to external circumstances, but it is not a past *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect, as suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post contains an ""explicit expression concerning suicide"" (""I was going to kill myself"") and a ""desire to not be alive any longer"" (implied by the intent to kill oneself). However, it ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The rule states: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'. If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" Since the post explicitly states a past desire/plan to kill oneself but provides no specific method, it aligns with 'Ideation'. The fact that the plan is now postponed doesn't negate the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect, because no specific plan (method, tools, location) is mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect, as the post describes a past *intention/plan* (""I was going to kill myself"") that was *not* carried out (""Now, I know I can't do that""), rather than a concrete past action or attempt.

    Therefore, the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts (""I was going to kill myself"") without any specific method or action taken, even if the immediate plan is now off, classifies it as 'Ideation'.

I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""serious thoughts about suicide for days"", ""always think about suicide"", ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself"", and ""actually want to commit suicide"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""home life isn't that good"", ""fight a lot"", ""get me so mad"", ""social anxiety & seasonal depression"", ""adds to the fire"", ""feel like I'm doing it for attention"", ""feel like I'm faking it"", ""Am I being dramatic about this?"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user states ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"". This indicates seeking information about methods, but not the identification of a specific method they intend to use, nor any preparation for such a method. It's a search for *ways*, not a concrete plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None. The post describes past *thoughts* (""for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days"") but not past *attempts*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""serious thoughts about suicide"", ""think about suicide"", ""ways to kill myself"", ""want to commit suicide"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""actually want to commit suicide"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The user is *researching* ways, not stating a specific method they have chosen or acquired means for.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The instruction ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here, as ""researching ways"" is not an explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to past recurring thoughts (""for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts"", ""When we fight I always think about suicide"") and current/ongoing actions related to those thoughts (""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""want to commit suicide""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post describes researching ""ways to kill myself"" but does not specify a concrete plan, method chosen, or preparations. The definition of 'behavior' requires explicit planning like a specific method or preparations. Researching general ""ways"" does not meet this threshold. The guidance to lean towards 'ideation' if unsure about an explicit plan reinforces this.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'ideation' as it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or preparations.

231,Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being. Death and suicide need to be normalized,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"". Also, ""something better on the other side"" implies death.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Life is useless"" indicates hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide need to be normalized"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being"" combined with ""Life is useless"" and the explicit mention of ""suicide"" strongly implies a desire to escape current existence, which is a form of wanting to not be alive in the current state.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current thoughts and beliefs about life, death, and suicide. No past events or attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a desire for a state beyond life (implying a desire to not be alive in the current form), which rules out 'indicator'.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned, which rules out 'behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, which rules out 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit, as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""the thought of death"" multiple times and describes its perceived benefits (""never feel pain anymore"", ""never deal with the hassle"", ""to be nothing in a black sea of infinity"", ""to let go after holding on so tight"").
    *   Emotional indicators: Expresses a longing for the cessation of pain and hassle, framing death as ""beautiful"" in this context.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not present. The post focuses on ""death"" as a state of being.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrasing ""To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing..."" strongly implies a desire for the state of not being alive as an escape from suffering.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This is the crucial point. The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Since the words ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself"" are not explicitly mentioned, despite the clear desire for non-existence, the strict rule for 'Indicator' applies. The post talks about ""death"" as a concept, not the active act of ""suicide"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current thoughts and contemplation (""Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?""). There is no mention of past events or attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post expresses a profound desire for the state of death as a release from pain and life's difficulties. This indicates a strong underlying suicidal ideation. However, the definitions are very strict. The 'Indicator' category specifically states that ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'"" and that ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" The post uses the word ""death"" but not ""suicide"" or ""killing oneself"". Given the instruction ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"", and the absence of the explicit word ""suicide"", this post falls into the 'Indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself,"" ""committing suicide,"" ""as long as i don't see another day,"" ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""feeling like absolute shit,"" ""fucking outcast,"" ""so fucking tired,"" ""stuck in my head,"" ""no one i can go to,"" ""receive jackshit,"" ""selfish and irrational."" (hopelessness, despair, isolation, fatigue)
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""I'll use any method I can as long as I don't see another day."" This indicates a strong intent to find a method but does not specify a concrete method (e.g., a specific tool, location, or substance) or preparations. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""a specific method or preparations taken."" ""Any method"" is not specific.
   - References to past attempts: No.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""committing suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""don't see another day"", ""my will to live...hanging by a thread"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, only ""any method I can,"" which is not a specific method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Given that ""any method I can"" is not a concrete, specific method as per the 'Behavior' definition's examples, it falls short of an explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a strong desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The key distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life. However, it does not specify a concrete plan, method, or preparations. The phrase ""any method I can"" indicates an intent to find a method, but not a specific one. According to the definitions, 'Behavior' requires a ""specific plan"" or ""specific method."" Since no specific method or preparation is mentioned, and following the rule to choose 'ideation' when unsure about an explicit plan, 'Ideation' is the correct classification.

   - Emotional indicators: ""Failrure"", ""burden"", ""disappointment"", ""Pleasw help, i have nobody else"" (hopelessness, despair, cry for help).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" is a specific method and an action.
   - References to past attempts: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" directly describes a past action intended to end life.

   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the medication was a preparation for an attempt.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a past event (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"") and current/future intentions (""What shoul i do kill mslef"").
   - Past attempts are specifically described: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly describes a ""concrete action"" that ""happened in the past"" with the intent of suicide (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing""). This aligns with the 'attempt' definition.
   - The rule states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The post contains both a past attempt description and current suicidal ideation/questioning.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Goodbye,"" ""I'm going to end it,"" ""I will be non existent."" These are strong indicators of suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""struggling with depression.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil."" This is a very specific method. The timing ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes"" indicates immediacy.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the phrases ""I'm going to end it,"" ""Goodbye world,"" and ""I will be non existent"" combined with a lethal method are explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going to end it tonight,"" ""I will be non existent.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil."" This is a clear, specific method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The mention of ""a whole bottle"" implies the means are acquired or readily available, and the immediate timeframe suggests imminent action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""I'm going to end it tonight,"" ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post goes beyond general distress (ruling out 'Indicator').
   - It contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and a *specific plan* (method and means) with an *immediate timeframe*. This fits the definition of 'Behavior' (""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"").
   - It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" No methods or preparations are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"" is an explicit reference to self-harm/suicide, even if it's a negation of a plan. It indicates the *thought* is present.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly ""I want to die,"" but ""I can't take it anymore"" combined with ""drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared"" and the reference to ""hurt myself"" strongly suggests a desire for relief from unbearable pain, which is characteristic of suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because the post contains explicit mentions concerning self-harm/suicide (""I don't have a plan to hurt myself,"" ""awful thoughts"" in this context).
    *   **Ideation:** This fits perfectly. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""drowning in these awful thoughts,"" and the need to state ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"" implies the thought of self-harm is present) but explicitly states there is no specific plan.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because the post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself."" There is no mention of a specific plan or self-harming behavior.

I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me.

I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I fucking hate being alive.""
        *   ""I want to die or reverse time""
        *   ""I haven't died because of the old 'your parents will be sad dummy' thing.""
        *   ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time""
        *   ""I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it"" (physical manifestation of distress)
        *   ""I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head."" (Self-harm ideation, but explicitly *not* acted upon, and ""in my head"").
        *   ""Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me"" (Passive death wish, not a plan).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, anger, fear.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The passive death wishes are not plans. The imagined self-harm is explicitly stated as not being acted upon.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression"". This is hospitalization for depression, not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt (e.g., overdose, concrete action). The definition for 'attempt' requires a ""concrete action.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time."" This clearly indicates a desire to not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself,"" which negates any current self-harm behavior. The imagined self-harm is mental, not physical.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Current/future intentions: ""I want to die,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day.""
    *   Past events: ""I was hospitalized in highschool for depression."" This is a past mental health event, but not a described past suicide attempt as per the definition.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and thinking about dying daily, which goes beyond general distress or a vague feeling about death.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" such as ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day."" However, there is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" There are no methods, preparations, or current self-harm behaviors described.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The imagined self-harm is explicitly stated as not being acted upon.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. While the user mentions hospitalization for depression in the past, it does not describe a concrete past suicide attempt (e.g., overdose). The definition requires a ""concrete action.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Key elements:** ""hurting,"" ""depressed,"" ""exhausting,"" ""my own body is giving up,"" ""I'm really hoping I will die in my sleep tonight.""
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm really hoping I will die in my sleep tonight"" is a direct expression of a desire for death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hurting,"" ""depressed,"" ""exhausting,"" ""body is giving up"" all indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (like tools, locations, substances), or preparations (like notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""Die in my sleep"" is a passive wish for death, not an active plan to cause it.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I'm really hoping I will die in my sleep tonight"" is a direct and explicit expression of wanting to die/not be alive.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** It is not unclear; the desire to die is explicit.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No. ""Die in my sleep"" describes the desired outcome and context, but not an active method or action to achieve it.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** There is no explicit planning, confirming it's not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current/future intentions (""tonight"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die (""I'm really hoping I will die in my sleep tonight""). This rules out 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' lacks *any* explicit expression concerning suicide or a desire to die.
    *   There is no specific plan or method mentioned (e.g., how they would ensure they die in their sleep, or any active steps to cause death). This rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of past suicide attempts. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   The post perfectly fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""Zoloft overdose"" and ""wasn't enough to kill me,"" indicating an intent to die through self-harm (overdose).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post describes physical symptoms after the event (""slight nausea and I'm really sweaty"") and asks about well-being, but the core content is about a past suicidal act.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method (""Zoloft overdose,"" ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"") is described. This is not a plan for the future, but a description of a past action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The entire post is a recounting of a past action intended to be lethal, which fits the definition of a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""wasn't enough to kill me"" directly refers to the suicidal intent of the overdose.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The past action itself (""took...to kill me"") implies a past desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Zoloft overdose,"" ""6 pills the equivalent to 300mg."" However, this is a description of a *past* method used, not a *current* plan for future action.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills is the execution of a past attempt.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This clearly refers to a *past event* (""at 11:30 I took,"" ""It obviously wasn't enough to kill me""). The question about going to the hospital relates to the consequences of this past event.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the post describes a specific past action intended to end life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes a ""concrete action"" (""took 6 pills"") that ""happened in the past"" with the clear intent to ""kill me."" This precisely matches the definition of ""Attempt"": ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""
    *   It is not 'Indicator' as suicide/death is explicitly mentioned and an action was taken.
    *   It is not 'Ideation' as it goes beyond thoughts to a concrete action.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' as 'Behavior' focuses on *current* plans or *current* self-harming behavior, whereas this describes a *past* event.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains strong implications: ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" ""At peace knowing it's soon,"" ""Hope my plan works,"" and ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up."" The phrase ""no way I'm living"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feel so calm about it,"" ""At peace knowing it's soon"" - these indicate a state of resolve regarding the implied action.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A ""plan"" is explicitly mentioned (""Hope my plan works""), but no *specific details* of the method (e.g., overdose, jumping, specific weapon) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are provided.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.
2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used. However, the combination of ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" ""soon,"" ""plan works,"" and ""no way I'm living"" clearly conveys suicidal intent and a desire to end life. ""No way I'm living"" is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.""
3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post mentions ""my plan"" but does not detail *what* the plan is (e.g., specific tool, location, substance).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The user states ""I've made my decision"" and ""it's soon,"" implying a mental preparation and a timeline, but no *physical* preparations (like acquiring means or writing a note) are described.
    *   The 'Behavior' definition requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)"". Since these specifics are absent, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.
4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""destined to do it,"" ""it's soon,"" ""Hope my plan works"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive (""no way I'm living"") and clear suicidal intent, even if the word ""suicide"" isn't used.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""no way I'm living,"" ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision""). It also mentions a ""plan"" but lacks the ""specific plan how to do so"" (i.e., specific method or preparations) required for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While a ""plan"" is mentioned, no specific method, means, or detailed preparations are described, which are crucial for this category.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it refers to future intent, not a past action.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and intent, including the existence of a plan, but without providing the specific details of that plan (method, means, location) that would elevate it to 'Behavior'.

I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""Hopeless,"" ""felt hopeless for months,"" ""realizing you're hopeless is too much."" The user also states, ""I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better,"" indicating a deep level of despair and a focus on ending their life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation (like acquiring means or writing a note) is mentioned. The user is *seeking* a forum, which is a step towards information or community, not a concrete plan of *how* to commit suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide forum.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the combination of ""hopeless,"" ""too much,"" and ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum"" strongly implies a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. Seeking a forum is not a preparation in the sense of acquiring means or setting a location.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I've felt hopeless for months"" is past, but ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum"" indicates a current desire and future intention related to suicidal thoughts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses profound hopelessness and a desire to engage with suicide-related content, indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - However, it does not mention any specific plan (method, means, location) or preparations for committing suicide. The act of seeking a forum is a manifestation of suicidal ideation, not a specific plan of action.
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'Indicator' is too low because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to engage with suicide-related content.
     - 'Behavior' is too high because there is no specific plan or preparation.
     - 'Attempt' is incorrect as no past attempt is described.
     - 'Ideation' fits perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

Idc if no one responds I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die even though I know it's painful idc just want an end",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""die"", ""slash my wrists and die"", ""just want an end"". This clearly indicates suicidal thoughts and a specific method of self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: ""disgusting to look at"", ""low my expectations"", ""Why couldn't I get even that?"", ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die"", ""idc just want an end"". These show deep distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""slash my wrists"" is a specific method. ""on the verge of trying"" indicates an imminent intention to act.
   - References to past attempts: ""I tried, I guess."" This phrase is ambiguous. It could refer to a past attempt at suicide, or trying to get away from parents, or trying to cope. Given the strong explicit current plan, this ambiguous past reference is less defining than the current intent. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action"" in the past. ""I tried, I guess"" does not meet this concrete action requirement.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""die"", ""slash my wrists and die"", ""just want an end"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""just want an end"", ""die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slash my wrists"". This is a specific method involving a tool/means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""on the verge of trying"" indicates an imminent intention to carry out the method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die"" clearly refers to a current and imminent future intention. While ""I tried, I guess"" might hint at a past event, the primary and most explicit content is about current suicidal intent and a specific method.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a method is given.
   - Not 'Ideation' because a specific method (""slash my wrists"") is mentioned, which, according to the definition, moves it into 'Behavior'. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - It fits 'Behavior' perfectly: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts [e.g., 'want an end', 'die'] and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide [e.g., 'slash my wrists']"". The phrase ""on the verge of trying"" reinforces the imminence of the behavior.
   - Not 'Attempt'. While ""I tried, I guess"" is present, it's too vague to be considered a ""concrete action"" of a past attempt as required by the 'Attempt' definition. The core of the post is a current, explicit plan with a method. If it were a concrete past attempt *and* a current plan, it would be 'Attempt'. But here, the past reference is ambiguous, and the current plan is explicit.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone."" This is a direct expression of wanting to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""my life is not able to be fixed,"" ""no-one I know has gone through the things I have gone through,"" ""bullshit phase,"" ""pain will all be gone."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and a sense of isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it."" This is a clear statement of preparation for one's own death, indicating a plan to die and manage the aftermath.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""I cannot wait to die"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to die.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I cannot wait to die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method (e.g., jumping, overdose) is mentioned.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it"" is a concrete sign of preparation for death. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations...)"". While not a method, arranging funeral costs is a preparation for the event of dying, indicating a plan to die.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings (""I cannot wait to die"") and future intentions/preparations (""ill fix all of the funeral costs"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I cannot wait to die""), moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   The statement ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it"" signifies a concrete preparation for death. This goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (ideation) and indicates a step towards planning for the act, even if the specific method isn't detailed. The 'Behavior' definition explicitly includes ""preparations taken."" Therefore, this fits the criteria for 'Behavior'.

The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free."" This is a statement about *not* dying, implying a desire for freedom from pain, but not a direct wish to die. There are no mentions of suicide or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, feeling misunderstood, suffering, and being trapped (""My parents never understands me and they treat me like shit,"" ""I just need someone in my life who would see that I am trying,"" ""I supposed to suffer,"" ""I am here to live in pain,"" ""The pain will never loosen it's grip"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The words ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"" are not present.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions. The phrase ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free"" expresses a feeling of being trapped in pain and a desire for freedom, but it explicitly states ""never die,"" which is the opposite of wanting to die. It's a statement about the *permanence* of suffering, not a direct desire for death. According to the definition of 'Ideation', it requires ""a desire to not be alive any longer."" This is not explicitly stated. The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" applies here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to current feelings and a perceived future state of pain. No past attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post exhibits significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped in pain. This aligns with the general distress aspects of the 'Indicator' category.
    *   However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide* or a direct desire to die or not be alive. The statement ""I am convinced that I will never die"" is not an expression of wanting to die.
    *   Based on the definitions, particularly the requirement for 'Ideation' to have ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" and the strict rule to lean towards 'indicator' when explicit mention is unclear, this post falls under 'Indicator'.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned for *current* intent. The post explicitly states the main reason for *not* acting is the impact on parents.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, the poster explicitly states, ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" This is a direct, concrete description of the poster's own past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from,"" ""why bother going through all of it?"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, for current intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to past events (sister's suicide, *their own* past aborted attempt) and current suicidal ideation (""it actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" ""the idea of that state lasting forever"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out, as there are explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts/desires and a past attempt.
    *   **Ideation:** The post clearly contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""a desire to not be alive any longer,"" ""a welcome end to everything,"" ""sleep lasting forever""). However, the presence of a past attempt needs to be considered.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out, as there are no specific plans or methods mentioned for *current* intent.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide."" The post explicitly states, ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" This directly fulfills the primary criterion for the 'Attempt' category. The note in the definition (""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"") implies that 'Attempt' is a strong classification that can even override 'Behavior' if a past attempt is present. Since a past attempt is clearly described by the user, and there is also current ideation, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

There's no emotion anymore. No sadness, its just nothing. The pain in numb now, but that's nothing new. I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess. I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" is a clear, implicit mention of suicide. The overall tone of hopelessness and the apology ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best"" further reinforce this.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I can't continue this disappointment,"" ""no hope anymore,"" ""no joy anymore,"" ""no emotion anymore,"" ""pain in numb now."" These indicate severe despair, hopelessness, and emotional detachment.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess."" This specifies a location/method and shows consideration for the aftermath, indicating a concrete plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""I plan on doing it"" in this context is an explicit expression of intent to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't continue this disappointment,"" ""There's not hope anymore,"" and the clear intention to ""do it"" indicate a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""in the tub.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""there will be less of a mess"" suggests a consideration of the practicalities of the act, which points towards preparation or detailed planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I plan on doing it"" refers to a current and future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life.
   - Crucially, it includes a specific plan: ""I plan on doing it in the tub,"" which constitutes a specific method/location.
   - This fits the definition of 'Behavior' because it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a plan (specific method/location) and even some consideration for the outcome (""less of a mess""). It does not describe a past attempt.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:
     - ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" - Explicit mention of ending life.
     - ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" - Explicit desire to end life.
     - ""I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants... led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self"" - This describes ongoing self-harming behavior (misuse of medication leading to organ damage, self-starvation) which is causing physical harm.
   - Emotional indicators: Overwhelming despair, hopelessness, chronic suffering (physical and mental), feelings of failure, neglect, abandonment, and trauma.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post describes a method of self-harm (""addiction to use paracetamols"" causing liver damage, ""starve my self""). While not a detailed suicide *plan*, it is a description of *self-harming behavior* that is causing physical damage and is linked to the desire to ""end it."" The ""Behavior"" definition includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior.""
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past *suicide attempts*. The self-harm described is current/ongoing behavior.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and ""wanting to end it.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, the misuse of paracetamol leading to liver damage and self-starvation are described as self-harming behaviors. These are methods of causing physical harm to oneself. The definition of 'Behavior' explicitly includes ""exhibits self-harming behavior.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The phrase ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" indicates a future intention.
   - ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it"" indicates a current state.
   - The description of paracetamol addiction and self-starvation (""It damaged my liver,"" ""i starve my self"") describes ongoing or recent behavior.
   - No past *suicide attempts* are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""wanting to end it,"" ""going to end it"").
   - It also describes specific self-harming behavior (""addiction to use paracetamols... It damaged my liver... i starve my self"") which is causing physical damage. This directly fits the ""Behavior"" definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" The self-harm is clearly exhibited and described as causing harm.
   - It is not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - It is not ""Ideation"" because it goes beyond just thoughts and describes concrete self-harming behavior.
   - It is not ""Attempt"" because it describes current/ongoing self-harm and future intent, not a past completed suicide attempt.

   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I have no one""), despair, anger (""Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.""), loss, betrayal.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, a very specific plan: ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" Also mentions ""cutting myself again"" which is a self-harm method.
   - References to past attempts: ""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"" implies past ideation. ""I feel like cutting myself again"" implies past self-harm behavior, but not necessarily a past suicide *attempt* as defined (a concrete action to end life).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"", ""want to fucking kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I really want to fucking kill myself"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. ""lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" This is a clear, specific method. The location (""train station near my house"") is also specific.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post describes *thinking about* running away and *laying head on tracks*, which is a detailed mental plan for a future action, including a specific location and method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and future plans (""I really want to fucking kill myself"", ""I'm thinking about running away...""). It also references past states (""was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"") and past behavior (""cutting myself again""). The primary risk conveyed is current and future-oriented.
   - Past attempts specifically described? ""cutting myself again"" implies past self-harm, but not a concrete past *suicide attempt* (e.g., an overdose that happened). The focus is on current suicidal ideation and a future plan.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a specific plan.
   - Not 'Ideation' because there is a very specific plan mentioned (""train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head""). The definition of 'Ideation' explicitly states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - Not 'Attempt' because no concrete past suicide attempt is described (e.g., ""I overdosed last week""). ""Cutting myself again"" refers to past self-harm, but the primary and most urgent risk described is the current explicit plan. The rule for 'Attempt' states ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"".
   - This fits 'Behavior' perfectly. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I really want to fucking kill myself"") and also mentions a specific plan (""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head""). It also mentions self-harming behavior (""I feel like cutting myself again"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states, ""I had a few suicide attempts"" and describes one past attempt where the user ""being saved"". This directly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Nothing in my life feels real,"" ""guilty,"" ""pain,"" ""anger,"" ""shame,"" ""loser,"" ""don't care,"" ""fuck me."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" While the exact method isn't named, the description implies a specific, calculated, and more lethal approach (""different method,"" ""easier and not so easy to back out of,"" ""my math is off"" suggesting dosage/calculation). The timing is vague (""tommorow maybe... maybe next week... maybe next year"") but the intent to act is clear.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I feel shame for failing"" explicitly indicates a past failed suicide attempt. ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real"" also suggests this is an ongoing or repeated experience.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""end my own life.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the entire post revolves around this desire and intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" This implies a specific, calculated method, even if not named (e.g., overdose, specific means of self-harm). The ""math is off"" part strongly suggests a method requiring precise calculation.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The consideration of a ""different method"" that is ""easier and not so easy to back out of"" implies planning and selection of means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both: ""I feel shame for failing"" (past attempt) and ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method"" (current/future intention).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly describes a past failed attempt (""I feel shame for failing"").
    *   The post also clearly states a current intention to make another attempt with a specific, more effective method (""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of"").
    *   According to the definition of ""Attempt"": ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This perfectly matches the content of the post.

258,Satanic Groundhog day. A day feels like a month. Brain really hurts. No income. Nothing to do. Reminded every second of others successes. Even as I type this. No bueno. I used to feel entertained and not in hell watching Judge Judy and Heidi Klum. Nope. I hate everything. No money will rot your brain. It's over. All I want is courage to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" strongly implies a desire to end one's life. ""It's over"" also contributes to this sense of finality.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Satanic Groundhog day,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""Nothing to do,"" ""Reminded every second of others successes,"" ""No bueno,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""No money will rot your brain."" These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, mental anguish, and a feeling of being trapped and overwhelmed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" is not used, ""All I want is courage to end it"" is a direct and explicit expression of suicidal ideation in the context of the overwhelming despair described.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""All I want is courage to end it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""All I want is courage to end it"" refers to a current desire/future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, explicit expression of wanting to ""end it,"" which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., specific tools, locations, or actions taken).
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post describes current feelings and desires, not a past action or attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly as the post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""All I want is courage to end it""), but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going out of this world"", ""I'm offing myself then"", ""Goodbye world"". ""Offing myself"" is a clear, direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm not worth living"" indicates hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states a very precise date and time: ""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours."" This is a strong indicator of a concrete plan, even without a specific method (like jumping or overdose) being mentioned. The setting of a specific time for the act falls under ""explicit planning"" or ""preparations taken"" as per the 'Behavior' definition.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm offing myself then"" is an explicit statement of intent to commit suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going out of this world at that time"", ""I'm not worth living"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit method (e.g., gun, pills).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, setting a precise date and time (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours"") for the act (""I'm offing myself then"") is a clear sign of explicit planning and preparation. The 'Behavior' definition includes ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The precise timing is a form of explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a specific future intention (""I'm going out"", ""I'm offing myself *then*"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post goes beyond just thoughts or desires; it includes a very specific time-bound plan (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours. I'm offing myself then.""). This level of detail constitutes explicit planning.
   - 'Behavior' fits because the post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm not worth living"", ""I'm offing myself"") and mentions a specific plan (the precise date and time for the act). Even without a named method, the detailed timing constitutes ""explicit planning"" or ""preparations taken"" as per the definition.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post describes a future intention, not a past action.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions/feelings (""I want to kill myself so bad"", ""It will never be better""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and wanting to kill oneself (""I want to kill myself so bad"", ""I dont want to live""). This clearly moves it beyond 'indicator'.
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., ""I'm going to use X"", ""I'm going to Y location"", ""I've acquired Z""), which would be required for 'behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, which would be required for 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings without a specific plan.

261,"Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me. I just can't do this anymore, all the upset and pain and hurt I cause. I have to make it stop.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of these terms.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" (self-blame, feeling like a burden, implied desire for absence), ""I just can't do this anymore"" (hopelessness, exhaustion), ""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause"" (guilt, self-blame), ""I have to make it stop"" (desire for an end to suffering).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post implies a desire to no longer exist (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"") and to end suffering (""I have to make it stop""), but it does not use explicit words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression. ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" strongly suggests this, but it's an implication, not a direct statement like ""I want to die.""
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. The lack of explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire to die, despite strong emotional distress, means it leans towards 'indicator' based on the given rules.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to current feelings and intentions (""I just can't do this anymore,"" ""I have to make it stop""). No past attempts mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being a burden, which are strong indicators of potential suicidal ideation.
    *   However, the definition of 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide... Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   Since the post does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" or ""I am suicidal,"" despite the strong implication, it falls under 'Indicator' as per the strict guidelines.

I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better. I don't have anything to look forward to other than more mistakes and ruin.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital."" (implies suicide/self-harm as a potential outcome). ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it."" (explicitly refers to suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: ""lost,"" ""alone,"" ""no one understands me,"" ""hate myself,"" ""make mistakes,"" ""make it everyone's life progressively worse,"" ""can't anymore,"" ""on the edge,"" ""can't do this,"" ""living hell,"" ""unbearable,"" ""nothing is better than this,"" ""ruin."" (High levels of despair, hopelessness, self-loathing, feeling like a burden).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) are mentioned. No preparations (e.g., suicide note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The fear of ""botching it"" suggests a lack of a clear, confident plan.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are described. ""I would have done it already"" is a hypothetical statement about a past desire, not a description of an actual past action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""I would have done it already"" and ""if I did it"" clearly refer to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge, I just can't do this,"" ""nothing is better than this,"" ""It has to be better."" These, combined with the explicit suicide mentions, indicate a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post mentions fear of ""botching it"" but no specific way of doing it.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes past struggles and current feelings (""I feel lost and alone,"" ""I hate myself,"" ""I can't anymore,"" ""I'm on the edge""). The suicidal thoughts are current intentions/desires (""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid,"" ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because no concrete past suicide attempt is described. ""I would have done it already"" is a hypothetical, not an actual past action.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because while there are explicit suicidal thoughts, there is no specific plan (method, location, means) or signs of preparation mentioned. The fear of ""botching it"" further indicates a lack of a concrete plan.
   - **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""desire to not be alive any longer,"" ""stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life"") without mentioning a specific plan or method. The user clearly expresses a desire to end their life but is held back by fear of failure, not by a lack of suicidal desire itself.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" and ""I would say I'm suicidal."" It also mentions a future intention: ""Of course I will wait till he's an adult,"" and ""11 more years then yes I could be there.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states the *lack* of ability/courage to act (""I don't have the balls to actually do it""). The mention of waiting ""11 more years"" is a future ideation, not a current plan or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and thoughts (""I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""I would say I'm suicidal"") and a future intention (""I will wait till he's an adult,"" ""11 more years then yes I could be there""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The user explicitly states they lack the courage to act.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past suicide attempts are described.
   - 'Ideation' fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I would say I'm suicidal,"" ""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life""), but it clearly lacks any specific plan or means to commit suicide. The future contemplation of suicide after 11 years is still a form of ideation, not a current, actionable plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of these words. However, ""I just want off this life"" is a very strong and direct expression of wanting to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""struggling to hold on,"" ""depressed and feeling like shit for years & years,"" ""struggling to hold on."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and significant distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want off this life"" is a direct expression of wanting to die/not be alive. This is more than a vague feeling about dying; it's a clear desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since there is no explicit planning, the category would lean towards 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The phrase ""I'm struggling to hold on"" and ""I just want off this life"" refers to current intentions/feelings.
   - ""Been depressed and feeling like shit for years & years"" refers to past and ongoing mental state, but the desire to ""get off this life"" is present.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a direct expression of wanting to die (""I just want off this life""), which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death. The definition of 'indicator' states ""no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This post *does* have a direct indication.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""I just want off this life"" is an explicit expression of this desire, and there is no plan.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.

   - Emotional indicators: ""completely failing school"", ""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore"", ""life just isn't worth it"", ""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, and internal conflict.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan or method is mentioned. The question ""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends"" is about the impact, not the method of suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post is asking for hypothetical ways to minimize harm, not describing a concrete plan or preparation for *how* to commit suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I need to kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I need to kill myself"" and ""life just isn't worth it"", which are clear expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings. This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The post does *not* mention any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide (e.g., ""I'm going to use X method,"" ""I'm going to Y location,"" ""I've acquired Z means""). The question about minimizing harm to others is not a specific plan for *how* to commit suicide. Therefore, it does not fit the 'Behavior' definition (""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior"").
   - The post refers to current thoughts and intentions, not past actions. This rules out 'Attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""By this time next week I'll be gone."" This strongly implies ending one's life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive (""By this time next week I'll be gone"") coupled with profound hopelessness. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' which states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I hope I don't make it,"" ""I just want to die,"" ""survive another attempt.""
    *   Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, feeling burdened by parental reactions (""how expensive the medical bill is,"" ""without having to hear them again"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No *new* specific plan or method is mentioned for a *future* action. The post refers to a generic ""another attempt.""
    *   References to past attempts: ""another attempt"" explicitly indicates that at least one suicide attempt has occurred in the past.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   ""another attempt"" clearly refers to a past event (an attempt that was survived) and implies a potential future one. The desire ""I hope I don't make it"" and ""I just want to die"" refers to current feelings and a future outcome. The mention of ""medical bill"" and ""hearing them again"" directly refers to the aftermath of a *past* attempt.
    *   The post is primarily driven by the experience of a *past attempt* and the desire for a different outcome in a *future* (implied) attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out, as there are explicit mentions of wanting to die and references to suicide attempts.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there's a desire to die, the explicit mention of ""another attempt"" moves it beyond just thoughts into the realm of past actions.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. The post does not describe a *current* specific plan or exhibit self-harming behavior *in the present*. It speaks about a *future* ""another attempt"" but without detailing the *how*.
    *   **Attempt:** This category is defined as: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide."" The phrase ""another attempt"" directly fulfills this criterion. The post is deeply rooted in the experience of a past attempt and the desire for a different outcome if a future one occurs. The rule states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While there isn't a *detailed* current plan, the explicit desire to ""not survive"" ""another attempt"" links current suicidal ideation directly to the experience of a past attempt. The core information conveyed is about a past attempt and the desire related to its potential recurrence.

The most prominent and defining element of this post is the direct reference to a *past suicide attempt* (""another attempt"") and the current feelings directly stemming from that past event.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly uses ""suicide attempt,"" ""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" ""intention of dying,"" ""point of no return.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""struggle to not think about,"" ""genuinely bothered me,"" ""struggle to categorize,"" ""weighing on me,"" ""bothering me."" These indicate ongoing distress and rumination about past events.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user describes ""testing my method"" and going ""until shortly before the point of no return"" for the first event. For the second, they ""went in with the intention of dying"" and again ""stopped myself"" at a critical point. While the *specifics* of the method aren't detailed, the *action* of engaging with a method to a critical point is described.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The entire post is a reflection on past actions. ""I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life,"" ""in the past year or two,"" ""Both of these happened long enough ago."" The user is explicitly trying to categorize these past actions as ""suicide attempts"" or not.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""suicide attempt,"" ""suicidal stuff.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, for the second event: ""I went in with the intention of dying.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Not explicitly named (e.g., ""pills,"" ""rope""), but the user refers to ""my method"" and describes engaging with it to ""shortly before the point of no return."" This implies a specific, prepared method was used in action.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Engaging with a ""method"" to the ""point of no return"" suggests preparation and concrete action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post *solely* refers to past events (""in the past year or two,"" ""happened long enough ago""). There are no current plans or intentions mentioned; the user is reflecting on the classification of historical actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The definition of 'Attempt' is: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'. Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   The user describes two ""concrete actions"" taken in the past involving a suicidal method, one explicitly with the ""intention of dying,"" even though they stopped themselves. These are not mere thoughts or ideations; they are descriptions of actions taken with suicidal intent that were interrupted or stopped by the user. The post is fundamentally *about* these past actions and whether they constitute ""attempts."" This perfectly aligns with the 'Attempt' definition.

270,"Why exactly should I even have hope anymore? Its evident from my entire life up until now that I was never meant to be happy. I have to learn to not get my hopes up or get excited over shit. Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I really want to die."" and ""Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone."" It also asks ""So what do I have to live for?"" and uses the phrase ""kill off my emotions"" (though this is figurative).
   - Emotional indicators: High levels of hopelessness (""Why exactly should I even have hope anymore?"", ""nothing ever gets better"", ""I will never achieve my goals""), despair, anger, distrust, self-blame, and a sense of worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. There is no indication of how, when, or where the user intends to die.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned. The post discusses past trauma (bullying, parental abuse) but not past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I really want to die"" and ""Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone"" are direct expressions of a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit planning mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The desire to die (""I really want to die"") refers to current feelings and intentions. Past events are discussed as background for current distress, but the suicidal thoughts are present-oriented.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I really want to die"", ""I'd rather die""). This rules out 'Indicator' because 'Indicator' is defined as lacking explicit expressions concerning suicide.
   - The post expresses a desire to not be alive any longer but does not include any specific plan (method, location, preparations). This perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation'.
   - The absence of a specific plan rules out 'Behavior'.
   - The absence of a description of past actions rules out 'Attempt'.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself"" are specific methods.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""looking up how to do it"" suggests researching methods, which can be considered a form of preparation. The mention of specific methods also pushes it beyond vague ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current contemplation and future intentions (""wish I had the courage to...""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because specific methods (""jump in front of a car"", ""stab myself"") are mentioned, along with ""looking up how to do it"". The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""

The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""contamplating suicide"", ""looking up how to to it"") and mentions specific methods/plans (""jump in front of a car or stab myself""). The phrase ""looking up how to do it"" also suggests preparation or research into carrying out a plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I don't want to be here anymore."" - Strong expression of not wanting to be alive.
        *   ""I want out so bad."" - Implies wanting to escape life.
        *   ""I want to leave and never come back."" - Implies wanting to end existence.
        *   ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all."" - Explicit wish for death, albeit collective.
        *   ""If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace."" - Further elaboration on the desire for death as an escape from pain and loss.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Nothing Is Beautiful,"" ""I'm so fucking done with this shit,"" ""I hate this so much,"" ""disappointment and failure,"" ""I can't trust anyone,"" ""I'm so fucking stupid."" - High levels of despair, hopelessness, anger, self-loathing, and distrust.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan or method for *personal* suicide is mentioned. The nuclear bomb wish is for collective death, not a personal suicide plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" and ""I want to leave and never come back"" are direct expressions of not wanting to be alive. The wish for a nuclear bomb to ""kill us all"" and for everyone to ""Rest In Peace"" is a very strong expression of a desire for death as a solution, even if it's for everyone. This fits the 'Ideation' definition of ""a desire to not be alive any longer.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for *personal* suicide is mentioned. The nuclear bomb is a general wish for collective death, not a personal suicide plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post does not contain specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) for the individual.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of not wanting to be alive and a desire for death (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out,"" ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all""). This goes beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" but it lacks ""any specific plan to commit suicide."" The desire for death is clear, but there's no *how* for the individual.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no ""specific plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" The wish for a nuclear bomb is not a personal suicide plan.

   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I die"", ""I want to die"", ""pull the trigger"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""so much pressure"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""pull the trigger"" clearly indicates a method (using a gun).

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"".
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

    *   Emotional indicators: ""No one cares for my Problems"", ""nothing happend"", ""couldn't hide my pain"", ""tired of putting a mask on"", ""tired all the time"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, and a feeling of being unsupported.

While ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" isn't a specific *plan*, it is a clear expression of current suicidal thoughts/desire.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" This is a direct statement of engaging in explicit planning.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned. The ""seven years"" refers to the duration of carrying the burden alone.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The word ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" are used multiple times.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by the increasing suicidality and seriously considering it, even if there's a stated internal conflict (""I know I would never do it"" due to fear of hell). The *thoughts* and *consideration* are explicit.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., gun, bridge, pills) is mentioned in the post itself.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. The statement ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" is a clear indication of preparation and explicit planning. While the details of the plan are not provided, the act of *creating* detailed plans is a concrete step.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current, ongoing thoughts and actions (""everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get,"" ""I write detailed plans in my journal,"" ""I think about suicide every day,"" ""seriously consider it only once a week or so"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. Suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there's more than just general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there are explicit suicidal thoughts, the post goes beyond mere ideation by stating ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" The definition of Ideation specifies ""without any specific plan."" The act of writing detailed plans constitutes a form of explicit planning, even if the method isn't described in the post.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts *and* mention of a plan or self-harming behavior. The post clearly states ""I write detailed plans in my journal."" This directly fits the criterion of ""explicit planning"" or ""preparations taken"" as described in the 'Behavior' definition (""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken""). The user is actively creating plans, which is a step beyond just thinking.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past attempts are described.

    The explicit mention of ""detailed plans"" being written in a journal is the deciding factor that moves this from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior', as it indicates a concrete step in planning, even if the plans themselves are not executed or fully described in the post.

   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. It is unclear if there's an explicit desire to die, so I lean towards 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current distress.
   - Past attempts are not described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress and pain, and a feeling of being overwhelmed (""I can't take it anymore"").
   - However, it does not explicitly mention suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts. It falls under ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" without direct suicidal indication.
   - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits perfectly within this definition.

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""commiting suicide"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The phrase ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober"" suggests a perceived ability to act on suicidal thoughts, possibly with a cynical or despairing tone related to AA.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method, location, or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. It speaks to the *capability* of the act, not *how* it would be done.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There is no mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""commiting suicide"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, the statement ""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober"" is a direct expression of suicidal thought and a perceived ability to act on it.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   *If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.* There is no explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to a current perceived capability and potential future intention (""I think I'm capable...""). It does not describe a past event or attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""capable of commiting suicide sober"") and a desire to end one's life (by stating capability for the act), but it lacks any specific plan (method, location, or preparations). This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific plan or method mentioned (e.g., ""I'll use a rope,"" ""I'll jump off a bridge""). The post only expresses the *capability* to commit the act, not the *how*.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because it does not describe a past suicide attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""dying."" Phrases like ""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I just want it to be over,"" and ""I want to be down"" express a desire for an end to suffering or life, but not explicitly suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit,"" ""Don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I don't want to be alone any more,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" ""I'm sick and tired,"" ""Please please please."" These indicate severe distress, self-loathing, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The post does not use words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"" directly.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrases ""I just want it to be over"" and ""I want to be down"" strongly imply a desire for life to end or for peace, which is often associated with death. However, the definition for 'Indicator' explicitly states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given this strict rule, the expressions are not explicit enough to be classified as 'Ideation' over 'Indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific methods or preparations are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and intentions. No past attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly shows intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and a desire for suffering to end (""I just want it to be over,"" ""I want to be down"").
    *   However, according to the provided definitions and rules, for a post to be classified as 'Ideation', it must include ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" The crucial rule for 'Indicator' states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
    *   Since the post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die"" in a direct, unambiguous way, despite the strong underlying despair and desire for an end, it falls under the 'Indicator' category due to the strict interpretation required by the rules.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" and ""I will use my suicide"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hate capitalism and everyone complicit in it"" indicates strong negative emotions and anger.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method, tool, or location is mentioned for the future suicide. The statement ""I will use my suicide to disturb people"" indicates a future intention but not a concrete plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" is a direct and explicit reference to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""attempted suicide"" and ""my suicide"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I will use my suicide"" implies a future intention to die by suicide, and the past attempts clearly indicate a past desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The statement ""I will use my suicide"" indicates a future intention but lacks the specificity required for 'behavior' (e.g., specific ways/locations/means/methods).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" refers to past events.
    *   ""I will use my suicide to disturb people"" refers to a future intention.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times,"" which directly fits the definition of 'attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide.""
    *   The 'attempt' definition also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" The phrase ""I will use my suicide"" can be interpreted as a current plan or intention, even if lacking specific details. Given the explicit mention of past attempts, this is the most fitting category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" ""I just want the pain to end."" (implies wanting to end life/suffering).
   - Emotional indicators: ""bottom of hell,"" ""bad break up that really messed me up,"" ""fell into depression,"" ""flunked college,"" ""fired,"" ""feel more lonely,"" ""no real friends anymore,"" ""given up completely,"" ""don't recognise myself any more."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific *current* plans or methods are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now."" This is a direct and explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Tried to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want the pain to end.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for a *current* or *future* plan. The mention of ""3 times"" refers to past actions.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for a *current* or *future* plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to past events (""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"") and current feelings of profound despair and wanting the pain to end.
   - Past attempts are specifically described (""Tried to kill myself 3 times"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"").
   - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
   - Even though there isn't a *current specific plan* mentioned, the clear description of *past attempts* is the defining criterion for the 'Attempt' category. The current feelings of wanting the pain to end reinforce the severity but the historical action is key.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death."" - Direct mention of death and the act of dying.
        *   ""don't kill yourself"" - Acknowledges the concept of suicide, albeit in a critical context.
        *   ""how to accomplish death."" - Explicitly discusses the means of ending life.
        *   ""I don't want my head to explode via shotgun"" - Mentions a specific method (shotgun) and expresses a preference against it.
        *   ""for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth."" - Mentions another specific method (handgun), discusses technical details (caliber), and a specific entry point (""through my upper palate in my mouth""). This is highly specific.
        *   ""I've looked into other options"" - Implies research or consideration of various methods.
        *   ""Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate."" - Discusses a *failed suicide* by another person, used to express fear of a similar outcome for the poster's own potential actions.
        *   ""my body is continuously accompanied by death."" - General feeling related to death.
        *   ""End it now"" - A general statement, but within a context of personal suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""in hell,"" ""so alone,"" ""painful feeling of inability to connect,"" ""sadder,"" ""terribly scared,"" ""pain,"" ""depression,"" ""high anxiety,"" ""It doesn't get better."" - Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details specific methods (shotgun, handgun) and even discusses technicalities like caliber and entry points for a handgun. The statement ""I've looked into other options"" indicates active research or consideration of means. This goes beyond vague thoughts into detailed consideration of *how* to die.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post refers to Mark Linkous's *failed suicide attempt*, but this is not the poster's own past attempt. The post does not describe any past attempts by the person writing it.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times, directly and indirectly (""how to accomplish death,"" ""don't kill yourself,"" ""failed suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by the detailed discussion of methods to ""accomplish death"" and the overall tone of despair and ""End it now.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, shotgun, handgun (with caliber and entry point discussion), and implied ""other options.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I've looked into other options"" is a sign of research/preparation. The detailed consideration of specific methods (e.g., ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth"") is a form of specific planning/consideration of means.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The discussion of methods and fears (""I don't want..."", ""for handguns I'm too stupid to understand..."", ""I've looked into..."") clearly refers to current considerations and future intentions regarding ending their life. The Mark Linkous reference is a past event by someone else, used to inform current fears about future actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""how to accomplish death"").
    *   Crucially, it goes beyond general ideation by mentioning specific methods (shotgun, handgun) and even details about them (caliber, entry point ""through my upper palate in my mouth""). The statement ""I've looked into other options"" also suggests active consideration and research of means.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and methods.
        *   'Ideation' is ruled out because the post contains ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods),"" which, per the definition, should be considered 'behavior'.
        *   'Behavior' fits because it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" and ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" through the detailed discussion of specific methods and implied research (""I've looked into other options""). The detailed consideration of *how* to die (shotgun, handgun, specific entry point, caliber) constitutes explicit planning or specific method identification.
        *   'Attempt' is ruled out as the post does not describe a past suicide attempt by the poster.

The detailed discussion of specific methods and their perceived efficacy/risks moves this beyond mere ideation into the realm of concrete planning or strong consideration of specific means, aligning with the 'Behavior' category.

There are no mentions of specific methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts.
2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:** While the word ""suicide"" is not used, ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a direct and explicit expression of wanting to die or not be alive. It's more than just general distress; it's a wish for a permanent cessation of existence.
3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:** No specific methods (e.g., overdose, jumping) or preparations are mentioned. ""Sleep"" is the desired state, not a concrete plan or method to achieve permanent cessation of life.
4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:** The post refers to current feelings and future desires (""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up""), not past attempts.
5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, explicit expression of wanting to die (""never ever wake up"").
    *   It fits 'Ideation' because it contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (a desire to not be alive any longer) without any specific plan or method.
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or self-harming behavior.

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before.

   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear that there is a desire to die/not exist, so it's not unclear.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The phrase ""wandering off into the night"" does not describe a specific suicidal method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan, so it leans towards ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""want to die"", ""want to not exist"", ""I almost hope something bad happens"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""want to die"", ""want to not exist"", ""want to disappear"", ""I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over."").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations to commit suicide. The ""wandering off into the night"" is a vague urge, not a concrete plan.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide."" It also says, ""Everyday I'm battling to stay alive"" and ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive."" The user feels ""people/the world would be better off without me."" These are direct expressions related to suicide and not wanting to be alive.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with strong emotional indicators: ""tired of everything,"" ""severely depressed,"" ""struggled with depression,"" ""shitty person,"" ""shame,"" ""emotionally unstable,"" ""anxious,"" ""lost so many friends,"" ""unemployed,"" ""isolated myself,"" ""feel so alone,"" ""life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it,"" ""can't imagine a future,"" ""impossible to love and forgive myself,"" ""feel like a drag."" These indicate deep despair, hopelessness, and self-worth issues.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The user only mentions ""ideations,"" which implies thoughts, not concrete actions or plans.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""ideations of suicide"" is a direct and explicit mention.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""battling to stay alive,"" ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive,"" and ""people/the world would be better off without me.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post describes thoughts (""ideations"") and feelings, but no concrete steps towards a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and ongoing struggles (""these days,"" ""Everyday,"" ""Most days""). The suicidal thoughts (""ideations of suicide"") are presented as a current comfort, indicating present suicidal ideation. There is no mention of past *attempts*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""ideations of suicide,"" ""wish I wasn't alive,"" ""battling to stay alive""). This clearly moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, the post *does not* include any specific plan (method, location, means) or preparations for committing suicide. It describes a desire to not be alive and suicidal thoughts, but no ""how.""
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires a plan) or 'Attempt' (which requires a past action).

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly states ""thinking about killing myself,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The user expresses a desire for their ""pointless situation to stop by crashing into another car,"" and fears ""that I won't die on impact."" This clearly indicates a desire for death as a means to end suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""constant anxiety and sadness,"" ""pointless situation.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""crashing into another car"" is a specific method. ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests repeated contemplation and near-actions related to this method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current and ongoing intentions/contemplations (""I want... to stop,"" ""frequently come close to doing it"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is an explicit desire for death and a specific method.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because a specific method (""crashing into another car"") is mentioned. The definition for Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** This fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die to end suffering) and mentions a specific plan/method (""crashing into another car""). The phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests more than just vague ideation, implying a recurring contemplation of the specific act.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past concrete action or attempt is described, only current desires and near-actions.
    The presence of a specific method (""crashing into another car"") and the statement ""frequently come close to doing it"" points to 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired of this empty loneliness I feel,"" ""My job and parents abuse me too."" (indicating despair, hopelessness, abuse).

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""I'm going to kill myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - However, it does not mention any specific plan, method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance), or preparations. The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" indicates intent but lacks the specificity required for 'Behavior'.
   - It does not describe a past suicide attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""Death is an option"", ""suicidal thought"", ""die"".
    *   Emotional indicators: The tone is contemplative and questioning, not overtly emotional like despair or hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The user explicitly states ""I won't commit"" and refers to a hypothetical ""accident"".
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""suicidal thought"" is used in the question.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user states ""I won't commit"". The statement ""if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome"" is an acceptance of a hypothetical, non-suffering death, not a desire to die or not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   No specific methods mentioned.
    *   No signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to current thoughts/questioning (""Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought?""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Not 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'**: There is no plan, self-harm, or description of past attempts.
    *   **Between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'**:
        *   The post *does* explicitly mention ""suicidal thought"" (in a question). This initially might lean towards 'Ideation' as 'Indicator' is defined as lacking ""any explicit expression concerning suicide"".
        *   However, the definition of 'Ideation' specifies ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". Crucially, it also states: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
        *   In this post, the user explicitly states ""I won't commit"" and does not express a *desire* to die or to not be alive. Their acceptance of death in a hypothetical accident is not an active desire for suicide. The post is a philosophical inquiry about whether their thoughts qualify as suicidal, rather than an expression of suicidal intent or desire.
        *   Given the explicit rule for 'Ideation' (""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'""), despite the mention of the *word* ""suicidal thought"", the *lack of desire* and explicit denial of intent (""I won't commit"") makes 'Indicator' the most fitting category. The post is discussing the concept of suicidal thoughts, not expressing them as the user's own desire.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   ""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me."" - Explicit mention of suicide, current intent.
    *   ""Its been a year since i planned this"" - Indicates a long-term plan.
    *   ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything."" - Clear indication of preparation and means acquired.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I wish i didnt have to do this, but im doing the right after all"" shows resignation and a belief in the act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Yes, ""finally kill me"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
    *   Yes, ""wanting to die or not be alive"" is expressed through the intent to ""kill me"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   While a specific method isn't named, the post explicitly states ""I planned this"" and ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything."" This clearly indicates a plan and preparations, which falls under the 'Behavior' definition's requirement for ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""Tonight is the last chance"" indicates a current/future intention.
    *   ""Its been a year since i planned this"" refers to past planning, but the action is imminent.
    *   No past *attempts* are described, only past *planning*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill me"").
    *   Crucially, it mentions a long-standing plan (""planned this"") and concrete preparations (""have the stuff prepared and everything""). This goes beyond mere ideation and directly into the realm of 'Behavior' as defined, which requires explicit planning or self-harming behavior.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""stop eating all together and starve myself"", ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Idk"", ""I'm to much of a pussy"", ""I hate my body"", ""I see no reason to fuel it"". These convey hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""stop eating all together and starve myself"" is a clear, specific method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""stop eating all together and starve myself"". This is a concrete method to achieve the desired outcome of death.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The decision to ""stop eating all together"" indicates an immediate and ongoing action towards the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""I've decided to stop eating"", ""I hope my body breaks down slowly""). It does not describe past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and a method is provided.
   - It's not 'Ideation' because a specific method (""stop eating all together and starve myself"") is clearly stated, moving beyond just thoughts or desires without a plan. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - It's not 'Attempt' because it describes a current decision and plan, not a past completed action.

It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is present. This is vague and not an explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire to die. It implies sometimes they might wish to be gone, but it's not a direct statement of suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness."" These indicate significant distress, sadness, and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: No past suicide attempts are mentioned. The post refers to past difficult life experiences (""dragged my face through the muds of life"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is vague. The definition for 'indicator' states: ""May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given the vagueness of ""wish to be gone"" and the absence of explicit language like ""I want to die,"" it falls under 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past difficult experiences (""In my past I've had everything...""), but the current emotional state is described as ""for now, in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness."" There are no past *attempts* described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress, sadness, and loneliness.
   - The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is the closest to a suicidal thought but is too vague and indirect to meet the ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" required for 'ideation'.
   - The 'indicator' definition specifically allows for ""vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide"" and emphasizes choosing 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mentions. This post fits that description perfectly.
   - There are no plans, methods, or past attempts described.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""suicidal"". It also mentions ""my death will cause"". The phrase ""destroyed myself"" indicates self-harm in a broader sense, but not a physical act.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Wish I could restart on life"", ""permanently fucked up this life"", ""depressed constantly"", ""lonely"", ""barely even have the strength"", ""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?"", ""feel worse knowing I'm hurting to delay the pain"", ""feel pathetic"", ""wish I wasn't so broken"", ""I want a restart :/"" all indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.

    *   References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used directly.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?"" and the general sentiment of wanting a ""restart"" because the current life is ""fucked up"" and ""destroyed"" oneself, coupled with ""my death will cause"" implies a desire to not continue living.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan or method, confirming it's not 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings (""I feel like..."", ""I'm depressed constantly"", ""suicidal"", ""lonely"") and current/future intentions (""Why push on"", ""my death will cause""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and expresses a desire to not continue living due to overwhelming distress and hopelessness. This clearly moves it beyond ""Indicator"".
    *   However, there is absolutely no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., how, when, where, with what). This prevents it from being classified as ""Behavior"".
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out ""Attempt"".
    *   Therefore, the post perfectly fits the definition of ""Ideation"": ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The post clearly expresses a desire to not be alive and considers ending life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post explicitly states uncertainty about *when* or *if* they will take their own life, indicating a lack of a concrete plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current thoughts and future possibilities (""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life,"" ""Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself""). There are no past attempts mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""take my own life,"" ""end myself""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   However, the post *does not* include any specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. The user states ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life."" This lack of a specific plan rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I just slit my wrists."", ""my death will only benefit people"", ""get it over with"", ""if you are seeing this then its already too late"", ""i wont have much time to live"", ""Goodbye"". These are explicit mentions of self-harm and suicidal intent leading to death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I have been so distant to everyone in my life and i am not a good person"", ""my death will only benefit people"", ""took me years o decide this but ow i just want to get it over with"". These indicate self-loathing, hopelessness, and a strong desire to die.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is. i marked where the my artery should be and i Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines."" This describes a very specific method and detailed preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes an action that ""just"" happened: ""I just slit my wrists."" It also states, ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it,"" confirming the action occurred prior to posting.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the description of the act (""slit my wrists"") and the explicit desire for ""my death"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""my death will only benefit people"", ""i just want to get it over with"", ""i wont have much time to live"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slit my wrists"", using a ""dremel and put the saw atachment on"", targeting the ""radial artery"", and ""followed the lines"". This is a highly specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is. i marked where the my artery should be"", and pre-typing the post to be published *after* the act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The key phrase is ""I just slit my wrists."" and ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it."" This clearly indicates a concrete action that has *already happened* very recently. ""If you are seeing this then its already too late"" further confirms the action is completed. This fits the definition of a *past* action, even if very recent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect, as explicit suicide and self-harm are clearly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect, as there is not only explicit suicidal thoughts but also a detailed plan and the description of the act being performed.
    *   **Behavior:** The definition states ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" While the post describes planning and self-harm, the phrasing ""I just slit my wrists"" and ""will post it once i have done it"" points to the *completion* of the act rather than just the planning or current exhibiting of behavior.
    *   **Attempt:** The definition states ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" The statement ""I just slit my wrists"" describes a concrete action that has already occurred. The post is being made *after* the attempt. This aligns perfectly with the ""Attempt"" category, as it describes a completed, concrete action in the past (even if the immediate past).

I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself. Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself."" It also mentions a friend who is suicidal, but the classification is for the person writing the post.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned by the poster for their *own* suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts by the poster.

    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The statements ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself"" refer to the poster's current thoughts and feelings. It is not a past event or an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal myself"") and a desire to not be alive (""I don't want to keep going myself"").
    *   It does *not* include any specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I wanted to die when i made that post"" and ""i just don't want to die."" It also describes life as ""meaningless torture.""

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of."" This implies a *lack* of current specific means available to the user, or at least that the parents have tried to remove them. The user states ""I could do it right now,"" but does not specify *how* or what method they would use. No specific plan or preparation is described by the user.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   The post *does not* include any specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific tools, locations, substances, or actions taken to prepare). While the user expresses a strong desire and a sense of immediate capability (""I could do it right now""), no *how* is provided. The mention of parents taking means even suggests a *lack* of readily available methods.
    *   Since there are explicit suicidal thoughts but no specific plan, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'. The rule states: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'. If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" This post has the desire but no specific ideas of *how*.
    *   It is not 'Behavior' because there is no explicit plan or method mentioned. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post describes a past state as ""desperate"" and ""extraordinarily painful."" However, the current tone is one of resilience and choosing to live (""I made the decision to live,"" ""The light at the end of the tunnel is almost here"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""set a date,"" ""my letters were written,"" and ""I had a set plan."" These are clear indicators of preparation and planning. No specific *method* (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned, but the *existence* of a plan and preparations is clear.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a past situation where the user ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself"" and had a ""set plan which I was days away from going through with."" It also mentions ""I've posted here so many times about how I set a date and then… I keep living past that date."" This refers to past instances of planning/intent, but explicitly states the person ""keep living past that date,"" indicating the attempt was not carried out.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post describes past desires (""set a date,"" ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself"") but the *current* sentiment is one of choosing to live.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""my letters were written.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to *past* events and intentions (""I came extraordinarily close,"" ""my letters were written,"" ""I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with""). The current state is one of having chosen to live and improved circumstances.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. Suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect. The post describes not just thoughts, but concrete planning and preparations (""set plan,"" ""letters were written"").
    *   **Behavior:** This category states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The post describes a *past* state where the user had ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts"" (""came extraordinarily close to killing myself"") and ""mentions a plan to commit suicide"" (""set plan,"" ""letters were written""). This fits the criteria for 'Behavior' as it describes past planning and preparation.
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect. The definition of 'Attempt' requires ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past."" The post explicitly states the person ""keep living past that date"" and ""came extraordinarily close"" but did not go through with it (""days away from going through with""). No concrete action of attempting suicide is described as having happened. The user was on the verge of an attempt, but did not complete it.

    Therefore, the post describes past planning and preparations for suicide, which falls under the 'Behavior' category, as no actual attempt was made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly implied and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because the post describes wishing a past action had occurred (""I'm angry at myself for not doing it years ago"", ""wish that I had just done it""), rather than describing a concrete past attempt that actually happened. The definition states: ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'"".

But, everytime i think about killing myself I also think about the things i should cancel before so that my family doesn't have to. I don't think anyone wants to deal with someone elses administrative stuff while they're dead. It sucks so much because there are times where i just get ready to die but then the administrative thought pops up.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide"", ""wanting to die"", ""killing myself"", ""dead"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed and suicidal"", ""It sucks so much"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a clear mention of a suicide note, which is a preparation. ""get ready to die"" implies readiness.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal"", ""killing myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""still wanting to die"", ""just get ready to die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., jumping, overdose) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user explicitly states having ""written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This is a suicide note, which is listed as an example of preparation for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""still wanting to die"", ""everytime i think about killing myself"") and a past action (""I have past the point where i have written a note"") that is a preparation for a future act. No past *attempt* is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""suicidal"", ""wanting to die""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - The key element is the mention of having ""written a note"". The definition of 'Behavior' explicitly states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)"". This matches the post's content.
   - While the post doesn't mention a specific *method* of suicide, the presence of a suicide note constitutes a 'preparation', which is sufficient for 'Behavior' according to the definition.
   - There is no description of a past suicide *attempt*, only preparation for a potential future act, so 'Attempt' is not appropriate.

308,Australia = Auschwitz. This country is a prison colony and it appears to be testing grounds to removing the flaws and imperfections in the human race and turning men into women.It's what hitler devised that he wanted to remove the flaws and imperfections and  wanted to purify the human race. We are all slaves to a fascist regime  that treats people as a number but we like to pretend that we live in a democracy to give us the illusion of freedom when there is no freedom. We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of personal death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The post mentions ""removing the flaws and imperfections in the human race,"" which refers to a genocidal/eugenic ideology, not personal suicide.
   - Note emotional indicators: Strong negative emotions like anger, paranoia, despair, and a sense of being oppressed (""prison colony,"" ""slaves,"" ""fascist regime,"" ""no freedom,"" ""controlled""). These are directed externally at a perceived societal system.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to suicide or self-harm.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post is a critique of society and government, not an expression of personal suicidal ideation.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is clear there is no explicit mention of suicide or wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there is no ideation or plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a current perceived state of society (""This country *is* a prison colony,"" ""We *are* all slaves""). There are no references to past personal suicidal actions or future personal suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses extreme distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but these are directed at the perceived societal and political situation, not at the self in a suicidal context.
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any personal suicidal thoughts or feelings.
   - According to the definition of 'Indicator': ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - This post perfectly fits the 'Indicator' category as it contains general distress and dissatisfaction without any explicit suicidal content.

I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks. Sorry for the post that is all over the place I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""my suicidal online friend,"" ""multiple suicide attempts per month,"" and critically, the writer states, ""especially when I'm suicidal myself."" This is a direct statement about the *writer's* own suicidal feelings.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The writer expresses being ""scared,"" ""confused,"" ""fucking sucks,"" and ""having a bit of a breakdown."" These indicate significant distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned *by the writer for themselves*. The post details the friend's struggles and past attempts, but not the writer's own plans.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post refers to the *friend's* ""multiple suicide attempts."" It does *not* state that the *writer* has made past attempts. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, the writer states, ""especially when I'm suicidal myself.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrase ""I'm suicidal myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings, implying a desire not to be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No, not for the writer.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No, not for the writer.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The statement ""I'm suicidal myself"" refers to the writer's *current* state of mind. The descriptions of ""multiple suicide attempts"" refer to the *friend's* past actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The writer explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself,"" which is a direct indication of suicidal thoughts, not just general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits. The writer explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal myself"") but does not mention any specific plan or method for themselves.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. There is no mention of a specific plan (method, location, preparations) for the writer's own suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post describes the *friend's* past attempts, not the writer's. The writer's statement ""I'm suicidal myself"" refers to a current state, not a past action by the writer.

Based on the explicit statement ""I'm suicidal myself"" and the absence of a specific plan for the writer, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method (e.g., tool, location, substance), or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The focus is on the *logic* and *desire* to end life.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are described. The post mentions past *thoughts* about suicide (""usually I find myself within a mind state..."") but not past *actions*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""end my own life,"" ""suicide,"" ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the entire post is a detailed explanation of the user's current belief that it is ""utilitarian for me to end my own life"" and a desire to ""check I'm making the right decision.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post discusses the *reasoning* for suicide, not the *how*.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - No past attempts are described as concrete actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned. This eliminates 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This eliminates 'Attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""end it all,"" ""solve everything"" (in the context of ending life), ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" These are clear expressions of a desire to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm so tired,"" ""won't ever be happy,"" ""Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure."" Shows significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user explicitly mentions a ""gun which would solve everything."" While they state they cannot get one due to location, this is a specific method being considered. Furthermore, the question ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" indicates an active search or desire for a specific method/plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, through phrases like ""end it all"" and ""solve everything"" (in the context of ending life), directly expressing a desire to die.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I don't want it anymore,"" ""if we don't want to be here.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""gun."" Even though the user states they cannot obtain it, it is a specific method being considered. The subsequent question about finding a ""good option for us to end it all"" further indicates a search for a method or plan.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No explicit signs of preparation.
    *   The mention of a specific method (""gun"") and the active search for ""a good option"" to ""end it all"" goes beyond vague ideation and indicates contemplation of *how* to commit suicide, which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current intentions and desires, not past events.
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' because it mentions a specific method (""gun"") and actively seeks ""a good option"" for ending life, indicating a contemplation of *how* to carry out suicide. This level of detail about methods, even if currently unattainable or still being sought, aligns with the 'Behavior' definition which includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" and ""explicit planning like a specific method.""
    *   There are no descriptions of past attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.

    Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with the mention of a specific method and the active search for a way to end life classifies this as 'Behavior'.

I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect.

So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing. Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head, sorry you had to read this, nasty",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""dislike it,"" ""disappointed in myself,"" ""feel like shit,"" ""hate it,"" ""felt disgusted,"" ""disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself,"" ""How ugly I felt,"" ""Terrible feeling."" These indicate strong negative emotions, self-hatred, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The act of masturbating to the thought of killing oneself is a disturbing manifestation of ideation and self-loathing, but not a *plan* or *preparation* for suicide itself.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wanting to kill myself.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post describes a disturbing psychological state and coping mechanism, but not a plan or preparation for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/recent thoughts and feelings (""I just kept thinking,"" ""recently I just felt disgusted"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""wanting to kill myself,"" which falls under ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, choosing a location, writing a note). The act of masturbating to the thought of killing oneself, while deeply disturbing, does not constitute a *plan* or *method* for suicide.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It does not fit 'Behavior' because there's no plan, nor 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described, nor 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed. Thanks for making it this far if you read the whole thing.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times. Phrases like ""die prematurely"", ""end my life"", and ""talking about wanting to end my life"" are present.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys feelings of being ""tired"", a sense of not being listened to (""No one is really listening""), and frustration with societal views on suicide. It expresses a deep personal conviction that suicide is a ""solution"" and a ""means of escape.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There are no mentions of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapon, location) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The post discusses the *idea* of suicide as a personal choice and a desired outcome, but not the *how*.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I would rather die prematurely"", ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"", ""talking about wanting to end my life"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post discusses the *philosophy* and *personal desire* for suicide, but not concrete steps.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and a future intention (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life""). It's a present state of mind and a desired future outcome.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"", ""talking about wanting to end my life""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of past attempts, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   Crucially, the post does *not* include any specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide. It discusses the *concept* and *desire* for suicide, but not the concrete *how*. The definition of 'behavior' requires a specific plan or self-harming behavior. Since there is no specific plan, 'behavior' is not the correct category.
    *   Therefore, 'ideation' is the most appropriate category, as it covers ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

318,"""your not cutting your faking it!"" stares at my arm motherfuckerly. Im tired of all the people who miraculously believe that im either cutting for attention or faking it. I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""self harm"" and ""cutting"" multiple times, describing a past incident (""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out""). It also contains the phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore,"" indicating hopelessness. There's a mention of someone encouraging the girlfriend ""to kill herself,"" but this is not about the author.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired,"" ""in pain,"" ""numb and empty inside,"" ""freaked out,"" ""cried myself to sleep.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No current plans or methods for *suicide* are mentioned by the author. The past incident involved ""cutting"" (implied by ""saw my arm"" and ""scars""), which is a method of self-harm.
    *   **References to past attempts:** A past self-harm incident is clearly described. The key is whether this was a *suicide attempt*. The post states the action was ""to try to relieve some of the pain,"" not explicitly to end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not by the author regarding their own intent to die. The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" expresses hopelessness but not an explicit desire to die or commit suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expressions. The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is a general expression of questioning life's worth, which falls under general dissatisfaction/hopelessness, not an explicit desire to die according to the 'Ideation' definition.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? For *suicide*, no. For *self-harm*, yes (implied cutting).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, not for current suicide.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. (Not applicable as there's no current suicidal planning).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The self-harm incident (""A few months ago..."") is a past event. The feeling ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" refers to a current/ongoing emotional state.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? A past *self-harm* incident is described. The definition of 'Attempt' requires ""past attempts at suicide."" The post states the intent was ""to relieve some of the pain,"" not explicitly to die. Therefore, it does not strictly meet the definition of a *suicide* attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator vs. Ideation:** The post expresses general distress and hopelessness (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore""). However, it *lacks explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e., a desire to not be alive any longer*. The rules state: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" And ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Based on these strict definitions, the post does not qualify for 'Ideation'.
    *   **Behavior:** The post describes past self-harm, but not *current* self-harming behavior or a *current plan to commit suicide*. It also lacks the explicit suicidal thoughts required for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Attempt:** The post describes a past self-harm incident. However, the definition of 'Attempt' specifies ""past attempts at suicide."" The post states the action was ""to relieve some of the pain,"" not explicitly a suicide attempt. Without explicit suicidal intent for the past action, it does not fit the 'Attempt' category.

    Given the strict definitions and the emphasis on explicit mention of suicide/desire to die, the post, despite describing past self-harm and current hopelessness, falls into 'Indicator' because it lacks explicit suicidal ideation or a clear past *suicide* attempt.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal ideation"", ""act on my suicidal thoughts"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressive spell"", ""spiraling worse"", ""fucking nightmare"", ""long wait in depression time scales"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The user is contemplating going to the hospital *instead* of acting on thoughts.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal ideation"", ""suicidal thoughts"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" implies this, even if the user is trying to resist acting on them.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The user explicitly states, ""while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change."" and ""I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts"". This indicates the *presence* of thoughts but a *lack* of a concrete plan or immediate intent to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"". There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" which means it cannot be 'Indicator'.
   - There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned for suicide. The user is actively seeking help (considering the hospital) to *avoid* acting on these thoughts. This rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The post clearly describes the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" without a specific plan, which aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I hope I die soon."", ""Soon I will be finally dead."" These are direct expressions of a desire for death. The word ""suicide"" is not explicitly used.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, anger (""Fuck that"", ""Fuck them!"", ""They will pay for how they made me feel!"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan or method for suicide is mentioned. The daily heroin use is stated as a current behavior, not explicitly as a planned method for suicide. There are no signs of preparation for suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None. The mention of taking an antipsychotic in the past refers to a negative experience with medication, not a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hope I die soon."" and ""Soon I will be finally dead."" are direct expressions of a desire for death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method for *suicide* is mentioned. While heroin use is stated, it's not presented as the *means to end life* in the context of a suicide plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Since there is no explicit plan, I will lean towards 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""I hope I die soon."" and ""Soon I will be finally dead."" refer to future intentions/desires.
    *   ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily."" refers to current behavior.
    *   ""Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go..."" refers to a future event.
    *   ""I once took a anti psychotic..."" refers to a past experience.
    *   No past suicide attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I die soon."", ""Soon I will be finally dead.""). This rules out 'indicator' as it goes beyond general distress and directly expresses a desire for death.
    *   However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for *how* the death will occur. The heroin use is not presented as a suicide method. This rules out 'behavior' (which requires a plan/method/preparation).
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem"" is a direct inquiry about a method to cause death to oneself. The user also explicitly states ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things,"" which indicates a strong desire to die and a dismissal of reasons to live.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness, apathy towards life and relationships, and a fixed intent to die.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A ""gun"" is mentioned as the tool, and ""hitting the brain stem"" is the specific target/method for lethality. This is a clear inquiry into the mechanics of a specific lethal method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the question about using a gun to hit the brain stem, combined with the dismissal of reasons to live, constitutes an extremely explicit expression of intent to end one's life. Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""I genuinely do not care for any of those things"" (referring to reasons to live) strongly implies a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""gun"" and targeting the ""brain stem"" are specific methods/means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Asking about the ""best position of the gun"" for a lethal outcome is a direct step in planning the execution of a suicidal act using a specific method. It's not just a vague thought, but an inquiry into the practical details of a lethal plan.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, the specificity of the weapon and the target makes it explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and an inquiry about a future action.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/intent and a specific method is discussed.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post goes beyond just explicit thoughts and includes a specific method/plan inquiry (""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem""). The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - 'Behavior' fits perfectly. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (implied by the dismissal of reasons to live and the direct inquiry about a lethal method) and also mentions a specific plan/method (""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem""). A gun is a ""tool/weapon suitable to end one's life,"" and asking for the ""best position"" is a form of explicit planning.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose"" is mentioned for past attempts, and the poster states ""I'm going to attempt again"" within ""Just a few more hours,"" indicating an immediate plan to act.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""Just a few more hours"" indicates a time-bound, impending action. ""Goodbye"" suggests a final farewell.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post refers to both past events (""tried to overdose three times,"" ""my first attempt"") and very immediate future intentions (""Just a few more hours. Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again."").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes past suicide attempts (""I've tried to overdose three times,"" ""my first attempt"").
    *   Crucially, it also states a present and immediate intention to make another attempt (""Just a few more hours... I'm going to attempt again."").
    *   According to the definition of ""Attempt"": ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'. Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   This post perfectly fits the ""Attempt"" category because it details past attempts and explicitly states a current, impending plan to attempt again.

My best friend drowned in front of me and I saved the person that killed him, my mom doesnt even remember most of her life let alone mine and has fits that cause her heart to stop and hopefully restart until it doesn't. My father is a pedophile,  my family on both sides wants nothing to do with me. And to top things off. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post does not explicitly mention suicide, self-harm, or wanting to die. It mentions a friend drowning and a mother's heart stopping, but these refer to others. The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" is present, which indicates extreme distress and a desire for relief from suffering, but it is not an explicit statement of suicidal intent or a desire to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, and being overwhelmed: ""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore,"" ""stuck away,"" ""doing nothing for her everyday,"" ""wants nothing to do with me,"" ""I just want this pain to end.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned for the user themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" is ambiguous. It expresses a desire for suffering to cease, but not explicitly a desire for one's life to end. According to the definition, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" Also, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** This rule applies here. The statement ""I just want this pain to end"" is not explicit enough to be classified as 'Ideation' given the strict definition requiring ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** Not applicable as no plan is mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current overwhelming feelings and circumstances (""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore,"" ""I just want this pain to end""). It also references past traumatic events (friend's death, father's actions, mother's condition). The desire for pain to end is current.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post conveys profound distress and hopelessness. However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire to die. The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" falls under general expressions of distress and wanting relief from suffering, but it does not meet the threshold of an ""explicit expression concerning suicide"" or ""a desire to not be alive any longer"" required for 'Ideation'.
    *   Based on the definition of 'Indicator' (""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'""), this post fits the 'Indicator' category.

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry. I'm so sorry. There is no putting me back together. Im broken. I'm damaged. I'm all fucked up. I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""I'm planning on killing myself"". It also contains phrases like ""Adios i can't. It's not worth it."" and ""this life for me isn't it."", which express a desire to end life.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what's wrong with me."", ""I'm sorry to the people i know in advance."" indicate distress and a sense of hopelessness.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions a *timeframe* for a plan (""at 30 or 25""), but no specific *method* (e.g., how they will do it) or *preparations* (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note for immediate action). The distant nature of the timeframe (""I still have a long time to rethink my decisions. I can still seek out help..."") also suggests it's not an immediate, concrete plan.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm planning on killing myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Adios i can't. It's not worth it. I can't."", ""this life for me isn't it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No concrete preparations are mentioned. The ""planning"" is about a very distant future *time*, not a specific method or immediate action. The post explicitly states the user has ""a long time to rethink"" and ""can still seek out help"".
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Given the lack of a specific method and the very distant timeframe, it leans away from 'behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions (""at 30 or 25"", ""by the time im around that age""). No past events are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires ""a plan to commit suicide"" with ""a specific method or preparations taken."" While the post uses the word ""planning,"" this plan is for a very distant future (8+ years away) and lacks any specific method, means, or immediate preparations. The user also mentions having time to rethink and seek help. The definition states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" In this case, the plan is not concrete enough in terms of method or immediate action to qualify as 'Behavior'.
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This fits perfectly. The user explicitly states a desire to end their life (""I'm planning on killing myself"", ""this life for me isn't it"") but does not detail *how* or show immediate preparation for such a plan. The ""plan"" is a distant future contemplation, not a concrete, actionable method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide rate."" The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" indicates a state of severe distress or being close to a breaking point.
   - Emotional indicators: ""teetering on the edge,"" feeling ""perceived as male and a threat,"" ""eyed with suspicion,"" ""respect for cismen who have to deal with being eyed with suspicion."" These show distress, vulnerability, and empathy for others facing similar issues.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide rate.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses the ""suicide rate"" in a general, observational context related to societal perceptions, not as a personal desire to die. ""Teetering on the edge"" indicates severe distress but is not an explicit statement of suicidal intent or desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" refers to a current state of distress. The discussion of the suicide rate is a general observation. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses significant distress (""teetering on the edge"") and mentions ""suicide rate"" in a comparative, observational context.
   - The definition of 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer."" This post does not contain such explicit expressions from the poster. The mention of ""suicide rate"" is a societal observation, not a personal suicidal thought.
   - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - While ""suicide"" is mentioned, it's in the context of a societal statistic, not a personal suicidal thought or desire. The distress is clear, but the explicit personal suicidal ideation is absent. Therefore, it falls under 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress without explicit personal suicidal thoughts or a desire to die.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide is a coward way to go out"", ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours.""
   - Emotional indicators: "":("" indicates sadness/distress. ""Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling"" sounds like a farewell.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A timeframe (""within 24 hours"") is given, and a farewell (""Peace out all..."") is present. However, no specific method (e.g., ""I'm taking pills"", ""I'm going to the bridge"") or concrete preparation (e.g., ""I've written a note"", ""I've acquired a weapon"") is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide"" is mentioned, and ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" is a very strong, explicit statement of intent to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" clearly expresses a desire to not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., type of tool, specific location, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The farewell (""Peace out all..."") and the timeframe (""within 24 hours"") suggest preparation and imminent intent, but they do not constitute a *specific method* or *concrete preparation* as defined for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations""). The rule states: ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The key distinction is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. While there is a strong sense of urgency and intent (the 24-hour timeframe, the farewell), the post *lacks a specific plan* (method, location, specific tools/substances) or *concrete preparations* (like having acquired means or a specific note). The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" Since no specific method or concrete preparation (beyond a general farewell) is mentioned, and given the instruction to lean towards 'ideation' if unsure about explicit planning, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses extreme distress, emotional suffering, and a feeling of being trapped and overwhelmed by the abuse (""it's killing me"" metaphorically).
    *   However, it does not contain any explicit statements of suicidal thoughts, a desire to die, or any plans for suicide. The primary focus is on the abuse and the desire to escape it.
    *   Based on the definitions, particularly the 'Indicator' definition which states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide.

   - Emotional indicators: ""every little problem, every panic attack"", ""What the hell makes them think this won't end badly.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post mentions ""bloodying myself up now"" which is self-harm. It states ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time."" This expresses an immediate desire to end life but does not specify *how* (e.g., a specific tool, location, or method for suicide).
   - References to past attempts: ""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend."" This refers to past *self-harm*, not past *suicide attempts*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations for *suicide* are mentioned.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past *suicide attempts* are described, only past *self-harm*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and a direct desire to do so (""I should do it now""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts and an immediate impulse, but it *lacks a specific plan or method* for *suicide*. While self-harm is present, it's not presented as the *suicide method* itself, nor is a detailed *suicide plan* outlined. The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Since no specific method for *suicide* is detailed, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.
   - The post describes past and current self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt*. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not appropriate.
   - Based on the explicit expression of wanting to die/kill oneself without a specific plan, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""someone blow my head off"", ""im fucking done"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me"". These are direct and explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""im fucking done"", ""tired if these stupidass ignorant people"". Shows extreme despair, hopelessness, and anger.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""blow my head off"" is a specific method mentioned, but it's phrased as a request for external action (""someone blow my head off"", ""please kill me"") rather than a plan the user intends to execute themselves. No preparations are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""blow my head off"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, very clearly.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my head off"" is a specific method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The key distinction between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' is the presence of a ""specific plan to commit suicide"" or ""explicit planning like a specific method"". While ""blow my head off"" is a specific method, it's presented as a plea for *someone else* to act, not a plan the user is making for themselves. The user is expressing a strong desire for a specific, violent end, but not detailing *their own* steps to achieve it. Following the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", this leans towards ideation because the agency of the plan is not with the poster.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current desires and intentions (""im fucking done"", ""please kill me"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit and strong expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - While a specific method (""blow my head off"") is mentioned, it is phrased as a desperate plea for external action rather than a concrete plan the user intends to carry out themselves. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The phrasing ""someone blow my head off"" lacks the self-initiated planning aspect that would categorize it as 'Behavior'. Therefore, it fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""cut my life short"", ""ended my life"". These are explicit expressions of ending one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""very anxious"", ""no plan"", ""can't keep a job"", ""struggle to pay"", ""won't work out long term"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. There is no ""how,"" ""where,"" or ""with what.""
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life"" are explicit mentions of suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrases clearly convey a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - Since no explicit plan or method is mentioned, it does not fit the 'behavior' category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (""My only option is..."", ""if I ended my life right now...""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The post expresses a desire to end life, but not *how* they would do it.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because it describes current thoughts/intentions, not a past action.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as the post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and describes a specific action: ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning."" It also mentions ""if I was gone.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of failure (""My whole life I've been a failure""), hopelessness (""Why was I born""), self-loathing (""can't stand the person looking back at me,"" ""I despise myself even more""), and despair (""I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed."").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details a specific method used in the past: ""took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers."" This is a concrete action with a clear method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post directly states ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and provides a detailed account of one of these attempts (""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and the description of taking a lethal amount of medication with the intent not to wake up.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die,"" ""honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning,"" ""if I was gone.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills implies they were acquired.
    *   The post describes a *past action* with a specific method, which aligns with the 'behavior' or 'attempt' criteria for method identification.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It explicitly refers to past events (""failed twice in the last 4 days,"" ""Yesterday I took...""). It also includes current suicidal ideation (""I want to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the overdose yesterday is clearly described as an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes *past attempts* at suicide (""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" and the detailed account of taking pills yesterday with the hope of not waking up).
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
    *   This post fits the 'Attempt' definition perfectly as it describes concrete past actions (overdose) with suicidal intent. The presence of current ideation (""I want to die"") does not change the classification from 'Attempt' if past attempts are also described.

And of course I can't consoling about it because I know some Petersonain victim blamer is going to come here and tell me to work harder; even though I am doing all the right things.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** None explicitly mentioned. The post uses phrases like ""horrible life,"" ""life sucks,"" ""total curse,"" and ""no way out,"" which indicate extreme distress and hopelessness, but not suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** High levels of frustration, despair, hopelessness, victimhood, anger, resentment, and a feeling of being trapped and unfairly treated.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses profound dissatisfaction with life and a feeling of being stuck, but not a direct desire to end life.
    *   If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. In this case, there is no explicit mention or direct expression.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to ongoing current feelings and past experiences of being mistreated. There are no future intentions related to self-harm or suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed by life's difficulties (""My life sucks solely because of factors outside of my control,"" ""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse,"" ""no way out"").
    *   However, it *does not* contain any explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or any suicidal thoughts. The definition for 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
    *   The definition for 'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" which is absent here.
    *   Therefore, based on the strict definitions, despite the high level of distress, the absence of explicit suicidal language places this post in the 'Indicator' category.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""spent the past few days researching tall bridges"", ""already drafted my suicide notes"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""commit when i get home"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to end life, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts by detailing specific research (""researching tall bridges""), mentioning ""a few methods to try,"" and stating that ""suicide notes"" have already been drafted. These are clear signs of planning and preparation.
    *   The definition of 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by)."" The mention of researching ""tall bridges"" and drafting ""suicide notes"" directly aligns with this definition.
    *   There is no description of a past *attempt*, only future intent and current preparation, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Well, I don't have anyone worth staying alive for anymore. Looks like I'm finally free to commit lifen't. This is a blessing. Finally moving forward and looking into my options to end it all. Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it, but I need to have the option to end it all. So, with those obstacles out of the way, I'm free to get cracking. I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row, and once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision. Live or die. This is a weight off my chest. It could finally be my time. If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell. Goodbye for now!",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""end it all,"" ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't,"" and ""end it"" multiple times.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses a sense of ""freedom,"" ""blessing,"" and ""weight off my chest"" related to the ability to end their life, indicating a profound shift in their mental state towards accepting or pursuing suicide.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""looking into my options to end it all"" and ""getting my ducks in a row."" While no specific method (e.g., a specific tool, location, or substance) is named, these phrases clearly indicate active steps towards *preparation* and *researching methods* for suicide. The user is not just thinking about it, but actively preparing for a future decision and action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no mentions of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""kill myself"", ""commit lifen't"", ""end it all"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""finally free to end it all"", ""it could finally be my time"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is explicitly named (e.g., ""pills,"" ""bridge"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""Looking into my options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"" are clear indicators of *preparations taken* towards forming and executing a plan. The 'Behavior' definition includes ""preparations taken."" This goes beyond just having the thought (ideation) and into active steps towards a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post clearly refers to current intentions and future actions (""finally free to end it all,"" ""looking into my options,"" ""once I'm ready to end it,"" ""it could finally be my time"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
    *   The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' involves explicit suicidal thoughts *without any specific plan*.
    *   'Behavior' involves explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan or *exhibits preparations taken*.
    *   The phrases ""looking into my options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"" are strong indicators of *preparations taken* for a suicide plan, even if the specific method isn't yet chosen or explicitly stated. These are active steps towards execution, not just passive thoughts. Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' definition more accurately than 'Ideation'.

    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   *If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.* In this case, there is no explicit plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I want to kill myself,"" ""constantly suicidal,"" ""I should be allowed assisted suicide""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does *not* include any specific plan, method, or preparations, which rules out 'Behavior'.
    *   It does *not* describe any past attempts, which rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   It *does* explicitly mention suicide, ruling out 'Indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Gonna end myself soon"" (explicit mention of suicide), ""to OD on"" (explicit mention of self-harm/suicide method).
   - Emotional indicators: Implied severe distress and intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on"" clearly states a specific method (overdose) and specific means/substances with quantities. This indicates preparation (having the substances).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Gonna end myself soon.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Gonna end myself soon.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a plan.
   - Not 'Ideation' because it contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (method, means, quantities), which, according to the definition, moves it to 'Behavior'. The post goes beyond just thoughts/desires by detailing the means and method.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it describes a future action, not a past one.
   - This fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""Gonna end myself soon"") and mentions a specific plan (""OD on"") with specific means/preparations (""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"").

All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" - This describes past self-harming actions with suicidal intent.
        *   ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood."" - Explicit death imagery, indicative of suicidal thoughts.
        *   ""she views people who kill themselves as weak."" - Mentions ""kill themselves.""
        *   ""suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it."" - Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a strong current desire to commit it.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Lonely,"" ""constantly feeling alone,"" ""bullied,"" ""don't fit in,"" ""inconvenience,"" ""coward."" - Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, and low self-worth.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No *current* specific plan (method, location, time) is mentioned. The ""knife to my wrist"" refers to past actions.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" - This explicitly describes past actions taken with suicidal intent. Even though the cut wasn't made, the act of putting a knife to the wrist with the intent to cut constitutes a concrete action in the past, aligning with an interrupted or non-fatal attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""people who kill themselves,"" ""suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it."").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead,"" ""I feel like I just need to do it."").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Only in the context of past actions (""knife to my wrist""). No *current* specific method or preparation is described for a future act.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. This post lacks a *current* explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life"" - Refers to concrete past actions/attempts.
    *   ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead"" - Current ideation.
    *   ""I feel like I just need to do it"" - Current strong desire/ideation.
    *   The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While there isn't a *current specific plan*, there is strong *current ideation* and a clear desire to ""do it"" alongside the past attempts. The presence of past concrete actions with suicidal intent is key.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator' due to explicit mentions of suicide and strong desire to die.
    *   Not solely 'Ideation' because the post explicitly describes *past concrete actions* taken with suicidal intent (""had a knife to my wrist 3x"").
    *   Not 'Behavior' because there is no *current* specific plan or preparation for a future act. The ""knife to my wrist"" is historical.
    *   Fits 'Attempt' because it clearly describes ""past attempts at suicide"" (""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut""). The definition states: ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past... When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'."" Here, placing a knife to the wrist with intent is a concrete action. Furthermore, the rule for 'Attempt' specifies: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While ""current plans"" might imply a detailed method, the strong current desire (""I feel like I just need to do it"") coupled with the past attempts makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate category according to the provided definitions and rules.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""before I kill myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""fucked up stuff,"" ""not entirely a good person,"" ""really need to feel loved,"" ""is there any hope of still being loved despite it?"" - These indicate feelings of guilt, self-worth issues, and a desperate need for connection/love, linked to the suicidal thought.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""I would like to feel that before I kill myself"" implies a conditional desire to die if the preceding condition (feeling loved) is not met.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - This post does not contain any specific plan (e.g., tool, location, substance) or signs of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to past actions (""I have done fucked up stuff,"" ""everything I have been through and everything I have done to others"") but the suicidal thought (""before I kill myself"") refers to a current/future intention, conditional on not feeling loved.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I kill myself"") and a desire to end one's life (conditional on not feeling loved), but crucially, it lacks any specific plan (method, location, or preparation). The definition states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" reinforces this.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

   - Emotional indicators: ""really depressed and sad,"" ""idk what to do,"" ""crying basically all night.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""tonight"" (timeframe), ""overdose"" (method).
   - References to past attempts: ""again"" explicitly indicates a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end myself,"" ""end it,"" ""overdose"" are explicit.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I think i'm going to try and end it tonight.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? The timeframe ""tonight"" is mentioned, and the method ""overdose"" is specific.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both current/future intentions (""tonight,"" ""going to try"") and explicitly references past attempts (""again""). The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan/method (""overdose,"" ""tonight""), which would typically point towards 'Behavior'.
   - However, the crucial word ""again"" signifies a past attempt.
   - The definition of 'Attempt' specifically covers cases where a post refers to past attempts *and* mentions current plans. Since both conditions are met (""again"" for past attempt, and ""tonight... overdose"" for current plan), 'Attempt' is the correct classification.

These are clear expressions of impending death and a desire for it. The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the desire for one's own death as a release from pain is very explicit.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I can't fight anymore, I can't try anymore,"" ""so tired that your eyelids feel as heavy as boulders,"" ""life and its pain,"" ""tortured soul."" These indicate profound hopelessness, exhaustion, and despair.

Yes, ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" and particularly ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all."" This is a very direct expression of a desire for one's own death as a means to end suffering. While the exact word ""suicide"" isn't present, the *intent* for one's own death is clearly expressed.

    *   The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die and for one's own death (""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""My death will release my pain""). This goes beyond general distress or a vague feeling about dying; it's a clear statement of wanting to die to end suffering.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It is not 'Indicator' because the desire for death is explicit, not vague. It is not 'Behavior' because there is no plan. It is not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain . I'm so scared I've never done anything like this before and I'm so scared of the pain I will cause to my parents and family . Thank you for listening and I hope I can get the peace i need .",2,behavior,"<thinking>

I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"", ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""no interest in modern life"", ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user states they ""contemplate method over 100 times a day,"" which indicates thinking about methods, but *not* explicitly stating a specific method, tool, location, or preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""contemplate method"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post says ""contemplate method,"" which means thinking about methods, not having a specific one chosen or describing it.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Since no specific method or preparation is detailed, this leans towards ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/ongoing intentions/thoughts (""constantly round and round"", ""over 100 times a day"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and the act of ""contemplating method,"" which clearly indicates a desire to not be alive and thinking about how to achieve it.
   - However, it does *not* specify a concrete plan (e.g., a specific method, location, or acquired means) nor does it describe any self-harming behavior or preparations. The phrase ""contemplate method"" signifies the *thought process* about methods, not the *existence* of a specific plan.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' because no specific plan is mentioned. It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It's not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.

I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

   - It does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - It does not describe any past suicide attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The explicit mention of wanting to die moves it beyond 'Indicator', which requires no explicit expression concerning suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" (implied suicide/death), ""I want to tell a suicide hotline"" (explicit mention of suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what to do,"" ""I feel like I'm a fuck up,"" ""can never get anything right,"" ""genuinely stupid human being,"" ""don't want to be locked up."" (Indicates distress, hopelessness, self-worth issues, fear).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a specific method and location.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide hotline.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a direct expression of a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? The person is ""sitting in my car right now thinking of driving..."" which indicates immediate consideration of the means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""sitting in my car right now thinking of driving..."", ""I want to tell a suicide hotline"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts and the word ""suicide,"" ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond general thoughts by detailing a specific method (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") and the current context (""sitting in my car right now""). This fits the definition of 'behavior' which requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""
   - There are no past attempts described, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - The presence of a specific plan/method elevates it from 'ideation' to 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The user explicitly states, ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" This is a direct reference to past suicidal struggles and a concrete action (hospitalization) related to it. They also express current/future suicidal ideation: ""I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""I hate myself so much,"" ""Im so regretful and sorry,"" ""I dont know how to process any of it,"" ""I dont see any future ahead for me,"" ""I am so scared."" These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."" This clearly describes a past event related to suicide, and hospitalization implies a concrete action or severe crisis, fitting the 'Attempt' definition's requirement for a ""concrete action.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""I've struggled with suicide before,"" ""joining her as well"" (referring to joining deceased mother), ""my passing"" (implying suicide).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I dont see any future ahead for me,"" ""I will be joining her as well,"" ""my passing.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to both past events (""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously."") and current/future intentions (""I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing"").
   - Past attempts are specifically described through the hospitalization. The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While there isn't a *plan*, there is strong *current ideation* and *future intent*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die.
   - 'Ideation' is a possibility for the current thoughts, but the presence of past attempts differentiates it.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan or method mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is the best fit. The post explicitly mentions ""I was hospitalised for it previously,"" which describes a past concrete action related to suicide. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""The content describes past attempts at suicide"" and ""A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose)."" Hospitalization for suicide implies such a concrete action or severe crisis. Furthermore, the rule for 'Attempt' states, ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post refers to past attempts (hospitalization) and also expresses current suicidal ideation/future intent (""joining her as well,"" ""my passing""). This combination makes 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification.

Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post states ""I wake up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" While not explicitly using ""suicide,"" ""tired of living"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive, and ""stop it"" in this context, following severe distress, strongly implies ending one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""My mind is hell,"" ""mental battle that I am losing,"" ""painful,"" ""nothing changes,"" ""worse thoughts each time,"" ""eating my mind,"" ""tear me down every night,"" ""feel so stupid,"" ""feel so weak, so hopeless,"" ""nothing makes it go away,"" ""nothing there."" These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and severe emotional distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I wake up even more tired of living"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" strongly implies ending one's life or suffering, which aligns with a desire to not be alive. This goes beyond vague feelings and directly expresses a desire to end the current state of being.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - As no plan is mentioned, this leans towards 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

    *   The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I wanna go sleep forever"") and critically, it mentions specific means and quantities of medication (""I have 58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg""). This constitutes a ""specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs)"" as per the 'Behavior' definition. It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing the means. It is not an 'Attempt' as it describes current possession and intent, not a past action. It is not 'Indicator' or 'Ideation' because a specific method/means is clearly stated.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die."", ""I'm tired of being alive."" These are direct expressions of a desire to end one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed"", ""miserable"", ""stuck in a loveless marriage with no way out"", ""He says mean things to me"", ""My kids are growing to resent me"", ""It's not fair to people to have to deal with me"", ""It hurts."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not explicitly used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die."" and ""I'm tired of being alive."" These are direct expressions of a desire for non-existence.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear; the desire to die is explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan mentioned, so it leans towards ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I want to die"", ""I'm tired of being alive"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"", ""I'm tired of being alive""). This rules out 'indicator' as it goes beyond general distress.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., specific tools, locations, or actions taken). This rules out 'behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I tried with a knife,"" ""I have a rope,"" ""There's a building,"" ""I have to do it,"" ""I should've done it a long time ago,"" ""I want this to end."" These phrases collectively indicate suicidal intent and past self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hate myself so much,"" ""I am scared."" (Despair, self-loathing, fear).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""I tried with a knife."" (Past method/attempt)
        *   ""I have a rope."" (Current means/preparation)

    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times. I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This explicitly describes past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the context of ""I tried with a knife,"" ""I have a rope,"" ""I have to do it,"" and ""I want this to end"" makes the suicidal intent explicit.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want this to end,"" combined with the context of methods.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""knife"" (past attempt), ""rope"" (currently possessed means), ""building"" (potential location for current action).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I have a rope"" is a clear sign of preparation/possession of means. Mentioning ""There's a building"" indicates consideration of a specific location.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
        *   **Past:** ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times. I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This clearly describes past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly describes *past attempts* (""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."").
    *   The post also mentions *current means/plans* (""I have a rope,"" ""There's a building,"" ""I have to do it"").
    *   According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This perfectly matches the content of the post.

A fly is worth more than i am. all they do is look for food and reproduce, i cant even do that. im useless.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I just want to end it"" strongly implies a desire to end one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Tired of it,"" ""No point to anything in life with depression,"" ""I feel pain,"" ""useless,"" ""most useless pos,"" ""A fly is worth more than i am."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and low self-worth.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""I just want to end it"" is a direct and explicit expression of wanting to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end it.""
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': This expression is sufficiently direct to qualify as ideation, not vague enough to be an indicator.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan mentioned, so it cannot be 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I just want to end it"" refers to a current desire/intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because there is an explicit expression of wanting to end life (""I just want to end it""), which goes beyond general distress.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly: The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""I just want to end it""), but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
   - 'Behavior' is incorrect because no specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" (desire to not be alive), ""attempt properly again"" (explicit mention of past suicidal behavior/attempt).
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed,"" ""Tired of being alone.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific *current* plan or method is detailed. The ""attempt properly again"" refers to a past action and a potential future one, not a current, actionable plan.
   - References to past attempts: ""attempt properly again"" directly indicates past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""attempt properly again.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for a *current* plan.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The phrase ""attempt properly again"" refers to past behavior and a conditional future, not a present, concrete plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" refers to a current desire.
   - ""that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" refers to a *future conditional* action, but crucially, it references *past attempts* (""again"").
   - The core element is the clear description of *past attempts* (""attempt properly again"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"").
   - More importantly, it explicitly describes past attempts at suicide (""attempt properly again"").
   - The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post fits this definition perfectly as it mentions past attempts and also current ideation.
   - It is not 'Indicator' because suicide/dying is explicitly mentioned.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts and explicitly references past actions.
   - It is not 'Behavior' because there is no *current* specific plan or method described for an immediate action. The ""attempt properly again"" refers to a past action and a future *potential* action, not a current, actionable plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""hide my body"", ""chop me up"", ""never get found again"", ""harvest my organs"". These are direct and explicit desires for death and body disposal.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme despair and a desire to cease existence and disappear.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly asks for someone to ""kill me"" (a method), ""hide my body"" (a preparation/outcome), ""chop me up"" (a method/outcome), and ""harvest my organs"" (a method/outcome). This is a detailed request for specific actions to end life and dispose of the body.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""looking for someone to kill me"" is a direct expression of wanting to die by lethal means.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""looking for someone to kill me and hide my body so that my family will never find out. I am happy for u to chop me up as long as i never get found again"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""kill me"", ""chop me up"", ""harvest my organs"". These are specific actions desired for the end of life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of ""looking for someone"" to carry out these specific actions constitutes seeking means/preparations for a suicide plan, even if it involves another person. The detailed instructions for body disposal (""hide my body"", ""chop me up"", ""never get found again"") indicate a concrete thought process about the act and its aftermath.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""I am looking for someone to kill me"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide/desire to die is explicitly mentioned with specific details.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post goes beyond vague thoughts and includes specific methods (""kill me"", ""chop me up"") and preparations/outcomes (""hide my body"", ""harvest my organs""). It's not just a desire to die, but a detailed request for how that death should occur and what should happen afterward.
   - 'Behavior' fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""looking for someone to kill me"") and mentions a specific plan/method (""kill me"", ""chop me up"", ""hide my body"") for ending life. The level of detail and the active search for someone to execute the plan clearly fall under the 'Behavior' definition, which includes ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)"".
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as it describes current intentions, not past actions.

    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: No past *attempts* are described, only a 10-year struggle with *thoughts*. ""Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here"" indicates no successful attempt, but doesn't describe an unsuccessful one either.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" is a direct mention. ""Fantasizing about my death"" and ""some days I consider it"" (in context of being fed up with fighting suicidal thoughts) are also explicit expressions related to suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post states, ""I have no desire to die,"" but immediately follows with, ""But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it."" This indicates a contemplation or consideration of suicide, even if the *desire* is conflicted. The presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death"" are explicit expressions of suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes an ongoing, current struggle (""I'm fed up with it,"" ""Every fucking day,"" ""some days I consider it""). The ""10 years"" refers to the duration of fighting *thoughts*, not past *actions*.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide/death is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death,"" ""consider it"").

While the user states ""I have no desire to die,"" the subsequent ""But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it"" clearly indicates the presence and contemplation of ending one's life due to the overwhelming nature of the thoughts. There is no specific plan or method described.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out as there are no specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past suicide attempts are described; the post focuses on an ongoing struggle with suicidal *thoughts*.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""wish to end my life"", ""end all this"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""wish to end my life"", ""don't have any more options here"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""wish to end my life"", ""end all this""). This means it's not 'indicator'.
   - However, it explicitly states the *absence* of a plan or ability to act on these thoughts (""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest""). This means it's not 'behavior'.
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts, so it's not 'attempt'.
   - Based on the definitions, the post fits 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

    *   Emotional indicators: ""I lost control,"" ""I've lost control of my head,"" ""I just want to cry,"" ""I can't breathe,"" ""I want to scream help please,"" ""I don't want to live this again."" These indicate extreme distress, feeling overwhelmed, and a desire for current suffering to cease.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" expresses a desire for the current distressing experience (""this"") to stop. It does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to be alive."" It's a strong expression of not wanting to endure the current suffering, but not a direct statement of suicidal intent. The rule ""If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" applies here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempts are described.
    *   **Behavior:** No specific plan or self-harming behavior is mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** The post does not contain explicit expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. ""I don't want to live this again"" refers to the *experience* of distress, not life itself. According to the definition, ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'.""
    *   **Indicator:** The post clearly expresses general distress, feeling overwhelmed, and hopelessness regarding the current situation. There is no explicit mention of suicide or a direct desire for death. This fits the definition of 'Indicator' which includes ""general expressions of distress or sadness"" and ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" The instruction ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" reinforces this choice.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The concluding sentence, ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"", is a direct inquiry about a specific method of suicide, with a particular logistical constraint (not leaving a body). While it's a question rather than a statement of a definitive plan, it clearly indicates active consideration of *how* to commit suicide and a search for a specific method. This moves beyond mere ideation into the realm of planning/seeking means.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions past *ideation* (""screamed that I wanted to die,"" ""fired for being suicidal"") but does not describe any past *attempts* (i.e., concrete actions taken to end one's life).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:** Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (""wanted to die,"" ""suicidal,"" ""Want. To die,"" ""kill myself""). Direct expressions of wanting to die are present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:** The post asks ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" This is a direct question seeking a specific method for suicide, indicating active consideration and planning of the act, even if the specific method isn't yet chosen. This constitutes a form of ""explicit planning like a specific method"" as the user is actively seeking information on *how* to carry out the act, with specific criteria.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:** The post refers to both past suicidal ideation and current, active suicidal intent and a search for a method (""I just. Want. To die,"" ""How do I kill myself""). There are no descriptions of past *attempts*, only past *ideation*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is clear ideation, the final sentence ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" goes beyond just expressing a desire to die. It's a concrete question about *how* to commit suicide, indicating a search for a method or plan. This is more than just ""without any specific plan how to do so.""
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body..."" directly pertains to seeking a ""specific method"" for suicide and indicates active consideration of the logistics of carrying out the act. This fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it shows a step towards planning the act, rather than just contemplating it.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there are no descriptions of past concrete actions taken to end one's life, only past ideation.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent and the active inquiry into methods (""How do I kill myself...""), the post falls into the 'Behavior' category.

I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains several strong indications of a desire to die or end life: ""No point in it all,"" ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""I wasn't meant for this world,"" ""question what the point of moving on is,"" ""I don't really see a future for myself,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally."" While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the intent to end life is clearly expressed through these phrases, particularly ""push me over the edge,"" ""free from it all,"" ""eternal void,"" and ""no point in waiting for it to come naturally.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong feelings of hopelessness (""No point in it all,"" ""won't get anywhere,"" ""no future""), despair (""trapped in limbo,"" ""view... dim,"" ""sick""), and self-worthlessness (""people are starting to lose hope in me (as they should),"" ""keep disappointing those who care"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""One last push"" is metaphorical, referring to a trigger or final impetus, not a concrete plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""push me over the edge,"" ""wasn't meant for this world,"" ""no point of moving on,"" ""free from it all,"" ""eternal void,"" and ""no point in waiting for it to come naturally"" are direct and explicit expressions of a desire to end life and not continue living. This goes beyond vague sadness or general dissatisfaction.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post expresses a strong desire to end life but lacks any concrete plan or method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I need something,"" ""I'll be free,"" ""I don't really see a future"").
    *   There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post contains explicit and strong expressions of a desire to end life, which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death. The explicit desire for ""eternal void"" and not waiting for death ""naturally"" indicates suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer... stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life."" The phrases clearly convey a desire to end life without detailing a specific plan.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. There is no description of a past suicide attempt.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned (""People who commit suicide"").
   - Emotional indicators: ""painful emotions"", ""bottled everything up"", ""snap and break down"". These describe a general process leading to suicide, not necessarily the author's current emotional state or suicidal intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post discusses *why* people commit suicide in general terms, not the author's personal desire to die or commit suicide. The phrase ""we've bottled everything up"" is a general observation about human behavior, not a direct statement of the author's suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a general understanding and explanation of the phenomenon of suicide, not the author's current or future intentions or past actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" but it does so in a descriptive, explanatory context about *other* people or a general human experience, not as an expression of the *author's own* suicidal thoughts or feelings. The crucial rule is ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"". Since the post does not express any personal suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts by the author, it does not fit 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt'. Despite the explicit mention of ""suicide,"" it falls under 'indicator' because there is no direct indication of the *author's* suicidal intent or ideation. It's a general commentary.

   - Emotional indicators: Anger, defiance, hopelessness (implied by desire to leave the world).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post discusses the *act* and its *consequences*, but not *how* it would be carried out.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""If I kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I just wanna leave a giant middle finger before I leave this world forever"", ""I'd be dead"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""If I kill myself"", ""before I leave this world forever""). Not past events.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and a desire to die (""If I kill myself"", ""leave this world forever""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, substances, notes). This rules out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This perfectly matches the post's content.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" These are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive or to die.
   - Emotional indicators: The post is saturated with emotional indicators such as ""tired,"" ""frustrated,"" ""demoralising,"" ""dread and anxiety,"" ""hate it,"" ""horrible,"" ""can't function,"" ""constant state of anxiety and/or depression."" These strongly convey hopelessness, despair, and severe distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The user states a future outcome (""Dead"") but not how they intend to achieve it or any steps taken.
   - References to past attempts: There are no references to past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Goddamn I am so tired of having to live."" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead."" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive or to die.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear; the expressions are direct enough to indicate a desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit planning mentioned, confirming it's not 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The desire to be ""dead"" in five years refers to a future intention/outlook. The feeling of being ""tired of having to live"" is a current state. There are no past attempts described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""tired of having to live,"" ""Dead"" as a future outlook) which moves it beyond 'indicator'.
   - However, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation, which differentiates it from 'behavior'.
   - It does not describe any past suicide attempts, so it is not 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation' as it includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

     - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
     - Not 'Behavior' because no specific plan or method is detailed.
     - Not 'Attempt' because it doesn't describe a past action.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"", ""put neck on the train tracks"". The question about instant death indicates seeking information for the plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions a past *thought* of jumping in a lake and drowning, but explicitly states ""she convince me not to"". According to the 'Attempt' definition, ""When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"", ""suicide by a train"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, through the explicit mention of planning suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""suicide by a train"", ""put neck on the train tracks"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" indicates a specific timeline/date for the plan. The question about instant death is seeking information relevant to the method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past *thought* of suicide, but primarily focuses on current thoughts (""Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday... suicide by a train is on my mind"") and future intentions/plans (""I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, a past *thought* of an attempt is described, but it was not carried out, thus not a concrete action as per the 'Attempt' definition.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicide by a train is on my mind"").
    *   It clearly mentions a specific plan: ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" with a specific method: ""suicide by a train"", ""put neck on the train tracks"". It also seeks information about the effectiveness of this method.

I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and that the poster is ""thinking about it"" (referring to suicide). It also states, ""it's now ok to try,"" which directly relates to considering suicide for themselves. It refers to someone else's ""attempt to end his life.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""rougher weeks,"" ""don't want to think like this anymore.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned by the poster for themselves. The ""ok to try"" is a thought/feeling, not a plan.
   - References to past attempts: The poster mentions having ""had some suicidal thoughts through my life"" (past thoughts, not attempts). It mentions ""an attempt of someone else,"" but the classification is for the person writing the post.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""ok to try"" (referring to trying suicide).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""it's now ok to try"" implies a current consideration and normalization of the idea of ending one's life, even if the poster also expresses a desire not to think that way.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post describes a thought process (""it's now ok to try"") rather than a concrete plan or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past ""suicidal thoughts"" but primarily focuses on current thoughts and feelings triggered by someone else's attempt (""Since then I keep thinking about it,"" ""it's now ok to try,"" ""I feel like this""). This indicates current suicidal ideation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, not by the poster themselves.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and the consideration of suicide as a current possibility (""it's now ok to try"").
   - **Ideation:** This fits well. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""keep thinking about it,"" ""it's now ok to try"") and a desire to not be alive (implied by ""ok to try""), but without any specific plan. The phrase ""it's now ok to try"" indicates a stronger, more explicit desire or consideration to end one's life.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations by the poster.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because the post describes past *thoughts* of suicide, not past *attempts* by the poster. It mentions someone else's attempt, but not the poster's.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses current explicit suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned, but the mention of specific methods/locations is present for a future plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""nearly killing myself one night"" refers to a past event/attempt.
    *   ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" refers to a current/future intention or plan.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit mentions of suicide, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a future plan with specific methods/locations (""step off a building or over a bridge""), which would typically fall under 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the post also describes a past event: ""nearly killing myself one night."" This fits the definition of a past 'Attempt' (""A concrete action need to have happened in the past"").
    *   Crucially, the definition for 'Attempt' states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This rule directly applies here, as the post mentions both a past attempt (""nearly killing myself"") and current plans (""step off a building or over a bridge"").

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i need a way out,"" ""i want to take myself out,"" ""i just need it to stop."" ""Take myself out"" is a clear euphemism for suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i need help,"" ""don't want to deal with it,"" ""disappoint and burden other people,"" ""scared it'll be painful."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The user asks ""what do i do, please?"" and expresses fear of pain, indicating a desire for a method but not specifying one.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""i want to take myself out.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i need a way out,"" ""i want to take myself out,"" ""i just need it to stop.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The user is asking for a method (""what do i do, please?"") rather than stating one.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""i need help,"" ""i want to take myself out""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""i want to take myself out,"" ""i need a way out,"" ""i just need it to stop"").
   - It does *not* include any specific plan, method, or preparations. The user is asking for a way, not stating one.
   - It does not describe any past attempts.
   - Based on the definitions, this perfectly matches 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die.""
   - Note emotional indicators: ""Screw this,"" ""Can't be fucked with anything anymore"" (indicates extreme distress, hopelessness, apathy).
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, but ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of wanting to die/not be alive.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die.""
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention/desire (""The more I live the more I want to die"").
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I want to die"") but does not include any specific plan, method, or mention of past attempts. This aligns directly with the definition of 'Ideation'. It's not 'Indicator' because the desire to die is explicit. It's not 'Behavior' because there's no plan. It's not 'Attempt' because there's no mention of a past action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I have been thinking on how to die painlessly"" and ""I want to die"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Quarantine has killed my mental health,"" ""feeling like a coward,"" ""lazy and useless,"" ""failure and a disappointment,"" ""burnout,"" ""so tired of expectations."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and low self-worth.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user states ""but I have yet to find a way."" This indicates a desire to find a method but explicitly states no method has been found or prepared for.
    *   References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" and ""I want to die.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post explicitly states ""but I have yet to find a way.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly"" indicates ongoing current ideation. ""I want to die"" is a current intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""thinking on how to die painlessly""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   However, the post explicitly states ""but I have yet to find a way,"" indicating no specific plan or method has been identified or prepared. This prevents it from being classified as 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a past suicide attempt. This rules out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of hate, despair, hopelessness, anxiety, and being ""over this shit.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This indicates a preparation (writing goodbye emails/notes) *before* a suicidal act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop."" This refers to past *ideation*, not a past *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Must end this shit show."", ""I'm very OVER this shit."", and the context of sending emails ""before I do it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it."" This is a clear sign of preparation, akin to writing a suicide note, indicating intent to act. The phrase ""before I do it"" strongly implies a planned future action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily expresses current distress and future intentions/preparations (""Must end this shit show,"" ""emails to send... before I do it""). The mention of ""thought about killing myself for 5 years"" refers to past *ideation*, but the overall context is current.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's clearly not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
    *   It expresses explicit suicidal thoughts, so it's at least ""Ideation.""
    *   However, the phrase ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it"" describes a concrete *preparation* for a suicidal act. The ""Behavior"" definition includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)."" Writing emails before a suicidal act is a form of preparation analogous to a suicide note. This moves it beyond mere ideation into the realm of planned behavior.
    *   It is not ""Attempt"" because it describes current thoughts and preparations, not a past completed action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Ending it soon"" is a clear indication of suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""so fucking depressed"", ""scared"", ""bad trip fucked me up"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here"". This describes a specific substance, a specific quantity, and a timeline for action (as soon as it gets here), indicating preparation and a method.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Ending it soon"" in this context is an explicit expression of ending one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Ending it soon"".
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""14 grams of dextromethorphan"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""Ending it soon"", ""I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here"").
   - No past attempts are described.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states suicidal intent (""Ending it soon""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a specific method (""14 grams of dextromethorphan"") and an active step of preparation (""ordered... in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here""). This aligns with the 'behavior' definition: ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide...

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post discusses ""Human tend to die around 80,"" questions ""how people can want to live?"" and ""how they actually find important to stay alive?"", and expresses a burden about ""60 fucking years left."" It does not explicitly mention suicide or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, and a lack of desire to live a long life (""it wasn't really good,"" ""60 fucking years left""). The author is questioning the fundamental value of life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The words ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or similar direct phrases are not present.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The post expresses a profound lack of understanding why people *would* want to live, and a personal feeling of burden about having to live for many more years. While it strongly *implies* a lack of desire to be alive, it does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to be alive."" It's more of a philosophical questioning of life's value combined with personal dissatisfaction. According to the definition, ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and future duration of life. There is no mention of past events or attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys significant distress, hopelessness, and a questioning of the value of life. However, it *lacks explicit mention of suicide* or a direct statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to live."" The questioning of *why* people want to live, while indicative of personal struggle, does not cross the threshold into explicit suicidal ideation as defined. The rules state that ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned"" and ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Based on these strict definitions, the post fits the 'Indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" ""suicide by cop,"" and ""suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses frustration (""Why would people be so counterproductive?"") regarding the actions of others, but not the poster's own emotional state related to suicide.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Suicide by cop"" is mentioned as a potential outcome for *someone else*, not a plan of the person writing the post.
   - References to past attempts: None for the person writing the post.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post is a commentary about how others might react or be affected, not an expression of the *poster's own* desire to die or not be alive. The subject of the suicidal thoughts/actions is ""someone who's passive suicidal,"" ""they,"" not the poster.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""Suicide by cop"" is mentioned, but it refers to a potential action of *someone else*, not the poster.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It discusses a general scenario and potential future reactions of *others*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The key rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
   - While the post discusses suicide explicitly, it does so in the context of *other people* (""someone who's passive suicidal,"" ""they""). There is no indication that the person writing the post is experiencing suicidal thoughts, desires, plans, or has made past attempts. The post is a commentary on a dangerous interaction dynamic, not a personal disclosure of suicidal ideation or behavior.
   - Since there is no explicit expression concerning suicide *from the person writing the post*, despite the general discussion of the topic, it falls under 'Indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I had a plan in mind ever since,"" ""think that might be the way I choose to go,"" and ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it."" These phrases clearly indicate thoughts about ending one's life. The mention of ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" points to a specific method for self-harm/suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden."" This shows significant distress, hopelessness, and a sense of being a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""a plan in mind,"" and specifically identifies ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" via a ""pump"" as a potential method (""think that might be the way I choose to go,"" ""getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible""). This is a concrete method linked to a specific means (insulin pump).
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post says, ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up."" This describes past *thoughts* or *considerations* but explicitly states they *didn't* follow through. The ""almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens"" is not explicitly described as a suicide attempt, and could be interpreted as an accidental overdose related to managing diabetes. The primary focus is on future intent.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, phrases like ""the way I choose to go"" and ""how to do it"" (in the context of a plan to end suffering/life) are direct expressions of a desire to end one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" using a ""pump."" This is a clear and specific method involving a lethal substance readily available to the individual.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The individual is anticipating getting a pump, which they identify as the ""easiest and most accessible"" means for their plan. This indicates a future-oriented preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily discusses current feelings (""depressed"") and *future* intentions/plans (""if it turns out I do [have diabetes]"", ""Going to get a blood test"", ""Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump if my condition goes south quick"", ""think that might be the way I choose to go"", ""getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest""). Past considerations (""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't"") are mentioned but are not past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect, as there are explicit expressions of wanting to end life and specific methods.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect, because the post goes beyond mere thoughts/desires and includes specific ideas of *how* to commit suicide (insulin via pump). The definition for Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
    *   **Behavior:** Correct. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""the way I choose to go"", ""how to do it"") and mentions a specific plan/method (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" via a ""pump""). This fits the definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs... suitable to end ones life).""
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect. The post describes past *thoughts* about suicide (""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't"") rather than actual past attempts. The ""almost went into shock"" is not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself"" is explicitly mentioned. The user states ""well I do"" in response to ""ever wanted to kill yourself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""☹️"", ""tired of everything!"", ""Worst birthday ever!"", ""nobody told me happy birthday or anything . they just walked past me like I was nothing…"" indicates distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have a chance right now."" This implies an opportunity or means is present, but it does not specify *what* that chance/method/preparation is (e.g., a specific tool, location, or substance). It is vague.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill yourself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""well I do"" (referring to wanting to kill themselves).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" is not a specific method or preparation as defined by the 'Behavior' category (e.g., ""suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable to end ones life, suitable locations...""). It indicates an opportunity but lacks specificity.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No concrete signs of preparation are detailed. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Given the vagueness of ""I have a chance right now,"" it does not meet the criteria for an explicit plan required for 'Behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""well I do and I have a chance right now"" refers to current intentions and a current perceived opportunity.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""want to kill yourself"", ""I do""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The post expresses a desire to end one's life (""I do"" in response to ""kill yourself"") and mentions an ambiguous ""chance right now"". However, it lacks a *specific plan* (e.g., method, location, specific means) as required for 'Behavior'. The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" is too vague to be considered an explicit plan. According to the rules, ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'. If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things.

Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it."" It also contains existential thoughts like ""We all die right? So why should I give a shit.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""stressed,"" ""bawling,"" ""mental health over this school year has been bad,"" ""crying myself to sleep,"" ""terrible,"" ""fucked up my head,"" ""confused,"" ""desolate,"" ""pathetic."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The user is ""considering"" suicide, but no ""how"" or ""when"" is provided.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""considering suicide.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to do this anymore"" (in context of the overwhelming stress leading to suicidal thoughts), and the direct mention of ""considering suicide.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit planning.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""considering suicide"" is a current thought/intention. The overwhelming stress is current. No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The user is ""considering"" but not planning.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past suicide attempts are described.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as the post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The phrase ""finally considering suicide"" directly matches this definition.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""attempted to end my life"", ""kill myself"", ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"", ""put down my knife"", ""almost committed"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""shaking and bawling"", ""worst feeling the worst suspense"", ""too much of a pussy"", ""Living life as a shell is bullshit"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""knife"" as a method, ""wrists and thighs are bleeding already"" indicating self-harm/action taken. The person was ""right there"" and ""ready"".
   - References to past attempts: ""I just attempted to end my life"" is a direct statement of a past attempt. ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"" describes the physical evidence of this past action. ""I almost committed"" reinforces the near-completion of the act.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes, ""attempted to end my life"", ""kill myself"".
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes, ""ready leave eveything"", ""Living life as a shell is bullshit"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods mentioned: Yes, ""knife"" and implied cutting leading to ""wrists and thighs are bleeding"".
   - Signs of preparation: The act was in progress or just concluded, indicated by the bleeding and the presence of the knife.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a very recent past event: ""I just attempted to end my life."" The post describes the immediate aftermath and reflection on an action that has already occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I just attempted to end my life"" and describes the physical consequences (""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already"") and the means used (""knife""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Attempt', which focuses on describing past concrete actions related to suicide. The details provided confirm a concrete action happened in the past.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape,"" ""slit my wrists,"" ""suicide note,"" ""So goodbye everyone.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail? That's impossible."" ""Kinda sad I never got to do anything."" Expresses hopelessness, despair, and feeling trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm ending my life tonight."" ""I've already written my suicide note and put it on my notes app."" ""I'm gonna just delete everything and just slit my wrists with some scissors when everyone is going to bed.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past *attempts*. The ""last post"" refers to a previous post, not a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times: ""ending my life,"" ""Killing myself,"" ""suicide note.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes: ""I'm ending my life tonight.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by clearly stating a specific method (""slit my wrists with some scissors"") and detailing preparations (""written my suicide note,"" ""delete everything,"" specific timing). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past completed suicide action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Based on the explicit suicidal thoughts, the specific method mentioned, and the preparations described, the post fits the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The phrase ""my plan to kill myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide. The comparison to ""preventing someone to get euthanized"" reinforces the theme of wanting to end one's life.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""what the fuck"" indicates frustration and anger.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself."" While it doesn't detail the *method* or *preparations*, the word ""plan"" itself signifies a formulated course of action beyond mere ideation. The fact that a ""friend"" snitched on this ""plan"" further implies its concrete nature.
    *   References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""my plan to kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by ""my plan to kill myself"" and the euthanasia comparison.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., gun, bridge) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The post states ""my plan to kill myself,"" which implies a plan was formed. The definition of 'Behavior' states ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". The phrase ""my plan"" fulfills this requirement, even without detailing the specifics of the method or preparations. It goes beyond just having suicidal thoughts; it indicates a formulated intention.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes a past event (""friend snitched on me"") related to a plan (""my plan to kill myself"") that was current or very recent, leading to current intervention (""now they're keeping their heads up and watching me""). It does not describe a past *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"").
    *   Crucially, it explicitly mentions ""my plan to kill myself."" This moves it beyond 'Ideation' (which is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"").
    *   While no specific *method* is detailed, the explicit mention of having a ""plan"" aligns with the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" It does not describe a past *attempt*.

    Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""im gonna kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hope my baby ends up safe"" indicates concern for a loved one, often present in suicidal ideation or planning.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions a clear timeline: ""3 weeks from now."" It also describes a preparatory phase: ""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children."" This withdrawal is a form of preparation. While a specific *method* (e.g., gun, pills) is not mentioned, the specific date and the planned withdrawal constitute explicit planning and preparations.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""im gonna kill myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., how they will kill themselves) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the specific timeline (""3 weeks from now"") and the planned social withdrawal (""minimally interact... won't reach out"") are clear signs of preparation and explicit planning for the act. The definition of 'behavior' includes ""preparations taken"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to future intentions: ""Im gonna... and then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It is not 'attempt' because it describes a future plan, not a past action.
    *   It is more than 'ideation' because it includes a specific timeline (""3 weeks from now"") and describes preparatory actions (social withdrawal for 3 weeks). This constitutes ""explicit planning"" as defined in the 'behavior' category, even without a specific method being named. The specificity of the timing and the planned pre-act behavior moves it beyond just thoughts or desires.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Would this kill me"" directly refers to death.
   - Emotional indicators: Implied distress, seeking information about lethality, suggesting a desire to end life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Yes, very specific substances (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, alcohol) and quantities (3 bottles, 30 20mg pills, bottle, full bottle). This indicates a detailed method and potential preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, ""Would this kill me"" in the context of accumulating lethal substances is a direct expression of wanting to die by self-inflicted means.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Would this kill me"" implies a desire for the described action to result in death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, an overdose using a specific combination and quantity of medications and alcohol.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the listing of specific items and their quantities (e.g., ""Midol 3 bottles,"" ""Prozac 30 20mg pills"") suggests these items are either gathered or being considered for immediate use as part of a plan. This goes beyond mere ideation to include a concrete method and means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Would this kill me"" is a present/future-oriented question, indicating current contemplation or intention. It is not a past event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is too low; there's explicit suicidal intent and means.
   - 'Ideation' is too low; it includes specific methods and quantities, which moves it beyond just thoughts. The definition states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" This post clearly lists specific means/methods.
   - 'Behavior' fits perfectly. It includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""Would this kill me"") and mentions a detailed plan with specific means/preparations (specific medications, quantities, and alcohol).
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect as it refers to a past action, not a current inquiry about a potential future action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""How I'm planning to end it"", ""suicide"", ""doing it in a way that doesn't looks like suicide"", ""car accident or something"".
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses a desire to end life, coupled with concern for loved ones' mental health, suggesting a deep internal struggle and a desire for a specific outcome (death).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Like a car accident or something"" is a specific method mentioned as part of a plan (""How I'm planning to end it"").
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide"" is directly used. ""How I'm planning to end it"" is also an explicit expression of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""How I'm planning to end it.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Like a car accident or something."" This is a concrete method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""How I'm planning to end it"" combined with the specific method ""car accident"" indicates a level of planning beyond mere ideation.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': In this case, the method is specific enough (""car accident"") to qualify as a plan under the 'Behavior' definition.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""How I'm planning to end it"" and ""recently I've been thinking of doing it"" refer to current thoughts and future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts (""How I'm planning to end it"", ""suicide"").
   - It also includes a specific method/plan: ""Like a car accident or something."" This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit suicidal thoughts *and* mention of a plan or specific method. It is not just a vague desire to die, but a contemplation of *how* to do it.
   - It does not describe a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is incorrect.
   - It contains a specific plan, so 'Ideation' (which explicitly states ""without any specific plan"") and 'Indicator' (no explicit mention of suicide) are incorrect.

These convey extreme hopelessness, self-worthlessness, and despair.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden and a failure.
    *   However, it *does not* contain any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive.
    *   It does not describe any plans, methods, or preparations for suicide.
    *   It does not describe any past suicide attempts.
    *   Based on the definitions: 'Indicator' states, ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I feel like shit"", ""depressed"", ""just fucking sad"". These indicate significant emotional distress, sadness, and loneliness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses sadness and a desire for connection, but not a desire to end their life.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Refers to current feelings (""right now"") and a need for immediate support. No past events related to suicide or future intentions of suicide are mentioned.

According to the definitions, ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This perfectly matches the 'indicator' category. The user is seeking support for their emotional state, not expressing suicidal ideation or plans.

398,"I wrote a note today. I've been struggling with this my whole life. But always I felt that there was some light at the end of the tunnel if only i could just get to it. Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more."" ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this."" ""I just can't continue."" These are strong expressions of a desire to end their current state of living or life itself.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""struggling,"" ""light has disappeared,"" ""severe anxiety,"" ""worthless person,"" ""don't know what to do anymore,"" ""at the end of my rope,"" ""at my wits end,"" ""system in place doesn't work,"" ""done me more harm,"" ""no results."" High levels of hopelessness, despair, and feeling trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I wrote a note today."" This is a significant detail, strongly implying a suicide note, which is a form of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital."" This describes a past mental health crisis leading to hospitalization, but it does *not* explicitly state a concrete suicide attempt (e.g., ""I overdosed,"" ""I cut myself""). The definition for 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more,"" and ""I just can't continue."" These are direct expressions of a desire for life to end.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., jumping, overdose) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I wrote a note today."" The 'Behavior' definition explicitly lists ""suicide note"" as an example of ""preparations taken."" This is a concrete action indicating preparation for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I wrote a note today"" refers to a current action. ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" and ""I just can't continue"" refer to current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, the ER visit is described as a past event, but it is not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt. It appears to be a mental health crisis or intervention.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end life/not continue, and a clear sign of preparation.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there is strong ideation, the mention of ""I wrote a note today"" pushes it beyond pure thoughts into a preparatory action, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category. The 'Behavior' definition states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...).""
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more"") and crucially mentions a preparation: ""I wrote a note today."" This directly matches the 'Behavior' definition's example of ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note).""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The past ER visit is not described as a concrete suicide attempt. The post does not state that a concrete action (like an overdose) happened in the past.

The presence of ""I wrote a note today"" is the key element that moves this from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior', as it signifies a concrete preparation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   ""Tried didn't work."" - Implies a past action that failed.
    *   ""Tried to end my life again."" - Explicitly states a past action of attempting suicide. ""Again"" indicates multiple past attempts.
    *   ""Didn't work."" - Confirms the attempt was unsuccessful.
    *   Emotional indicators: Implied distress and failure.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Not mentioned for the described past attempt.
    *   References to past attempts: Yes, clearly described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end my life.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by the action of trying to end one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   This section is more relevant for 'Behavior'. The post describes a *past* action, not a current plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This clearly refers to past events: ""Tried didn't work,"" ""Tried to end my life again.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. Suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect. The post describes a concrete *past action* (""Tried to end my life""), not just thoughts or desires.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect. While it involves suicidal action, the definition of 'Behavior' focuses on *current* plans or self-harming behavior. This post describes a *past* attempt, not a current plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Correct. The definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past..."". The post ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" perfectly fits this definition as it describes a past, unsuccessful suicide attempt.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post does not mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant distress and hopelessness (""Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore"") due to a persistent and unresolved medical condition.
    *   However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, a desire to die, or any suicidal thoughts.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness (""there is no better, this is it""), profound self-loathing (""self-absorbed whiny piece of shit"", ""fucking monster"", ""I suck"", ""flaming turd""), despair, feeling like a burden.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post *explicitly states*: ""I have no plans"". While methods like ""bullet in my head"" and ""slit my fucking throat"" are mentioned, they are presented as desires for how death might occur, often at the hands of others, rather than the user's own concrete plan or preparation. There are no signs of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""bullet in my head"", ""stomp me out"", ""slit my fucking throat"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, the post states, ""I have no plans"". The methods mentioned are desires for how the user wishes to die, but the explicit denial of a plan means it does not meet the ""explicit planning"" criteria for 'behavior'. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current feelings and desires. No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect, as there are explicit mentions of wanting to die and suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect, as no past attempts are described.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect. While methods are mentioned, the user explicitly states ""I have no plans"". The definition of 'behavior' requires ""explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The methods described are desires for how death might occur, not a personal, actionable plan. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" reinforces this.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits best. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" and ""stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life"".

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I will die alone."" (Mentions dying)
        *   ""I'm only alive by obligation."" (Implies a lack of desire to be alive)
        *   ""But the second they're gone, so am I."" (This is a very strong, explicit statement implying self-termination, conditional on parents' death. ""So am I"" means ""so will I be gone,"" referring to ceasing to exist.)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""what's the fucking point?""), despair (""sick of this emptiness""), self-loathing (""hideous fucking mutant,"" ""fat retard""), profound sadness, loneliness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., how he will ""be gone"") or preparation is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""I'm only alive by obligation"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""But the second they're gone, so am I"" is a very strong and direct expression of intent to end life, conditional on an event. This goes beyond vague feelings.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation':** The phrase ""so am I"" in the context of ""the second they're gone"" is a clear and explicit statement of intent to cease living, even if the word ""suicide"" isn't used. It's not vague; it's a stated intention.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior':** There is no plan or method, only a conditional intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Refers to current feelings (""I'm only alive by obligation"") and future intentions/conditions (""I will die alone,"" ""the second they're gone, so am I"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive (""I'm only alive by obligation,"" ""the second they're gone, so am I""). The latter phrase is a clear conditional statement of intent to end life.
    *   There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
    *   There are no past attempts described, which differentiates it from 'Attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death; it includes direct expressions of wanting to end life, making it stronger than 'Indicator'.

Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings and a desire to not be alive, but without a specific plan.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are mentioned, *except* for the explicit statement ""I have a plan"". The definition of 'Behavior' states, ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". The phrase ""I have a plan but no date set"" directly fulfills this criterion. Although the plan is not detailed, its existence is confirmed by the user.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current urges (""bad urges tonight""), current feelings (""I'm just lying here wondering""), and future intentions/plans (""this might be our last conversation"", ""I have a plan but no date set""). There are no descriptions of past *attempts*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I have a plan but no date set"". This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' (which is defined as ""without any specific plan to commit suicide""). The 'Behavior' definition explicitly includes posts that ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"". Even though the *details* of the plan are not provided, the *existence* of ""a plan"" is stated, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category.
    *   There is no description of a past suicide attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Based on the explicit mention of ""a plan,"" even without specific details, the post fits the 'Behavior' category.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" is a direct reference to a past suicidal state or action. ""I fucking hate living"" and ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"" indicate current strong suicidal ideation and despair.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hate how..."", ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"", ""I fucking hate living"", ""what the fuck did I do wrong?"", ""Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?"" - intense feelings of hatred, hopelessness, despair, and injustice.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific *current* plan or method for suicide is mentioned by the poster. The ""shooting up the school"" is attributed to the ex-friend's bullying and is not a current suicide plan by the poster.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""nearly killing myself"" strongly suggests a past instance where the user was on the verge of, or initiated, a suicidal act, which aligns with the definition of a past attempt or a very serious near-attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""nearly killing myself"" is an explicit mention.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I fucking hate living"" and ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"" are direct expressions of not wanting to live.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No *current* specific methods for suicide by the poster are mentioned.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""nearly killing myself"" refers to a past event/state (""bullied me into nearly killing myself""). This is a past severe suicidal crisis or near-attempt.
    *   ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away. I fucking hate living"" refers to current feelings and intentions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit current suicidal ideation (""I fucking hate living"", ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away""). This alone would classify it as 'Ideation'.
    *   However, the post also refers to a past event: ""bullied me into nearly killing myself."" The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" implies more than just passive suicidal thoughts; it suggests being on the verge of, or having initiated, a concrete action that was interrupted or failed. This interpretation aligns with the definition of 'Attempt' which requires a ""concrete action"" to have happened in the past.
    *   The 'Attempt' definition states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" While there are no *current plans*, there is significant *current ideation*. The primary trigger for 'Attempt' is the clear reference to a past action that was very close to completion. Given the strong implication of a past concrete action (even if thwarted or interrupted) by ""nearly killing myself"", and the presence of current suicidal ideation, the post fits the 'Attempt' category.

406,Survived OD. I can hear my mom In the back of my head saying 'you can't kill yourself with ibuprofen' taking down to a show or someone she knew (at this point I can't remember) I feel stupid because I can hear her voice in my head saying it can't be done. When I sat there and swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle. I definitely feel like my OD was like a *rawrxd* why do I feel like that. Why can't my brain just recognize like I could've died. I wouldn't have (in my brain) I wanted to. . I held off going to the hospital for as long as I could. I don't remember giving consent to go but my boyfriend said I did. Not that I could consent to anything (obv) idk I'm still processing everything and still feel weird even Calling it an OD. Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""Survived OD,"" ""kill yourself,"" ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen,"" ""drank hard liquor,"" ""could've died,"" and ""I wanted to [die]."" This clearly indicates a past act of self-harm with suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I feel stupid,"" ""feel weird,"" ""still processing everything,"" ""feel bad."" These show distress and ongoing processing of a traumatic event.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details a specific past method: ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle."" This describes a concrete action taken.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The opening phrase ""Survived OD"" immediately sets the temporal context as a past event. The entire narrative recounts the details of this past overdose.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill yourself,"" and the clear intent behind the ""OD"" and wanting to die.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wanted to.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle."" This is a detailed description of a method used.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act of consuming the pills and liquor constitutes the execution of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The entire post is a reflection on a *past event*. Phrases like ""Survived OD,"" ""When I sat there and swallowed,"" ""I held off going to the hospital,"" and ""my boyfriend said I did"" all point to a completed action in the past. While the person is ""still processing,"" the core content is about a historical attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:** Based on the analysis, the post clearly describes a *past suicide attempt* with specific details of the method used. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose).""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""Suicide has become my quick solution."" There is also a desire to ""find a way to get away from it all.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""totally helpless and misunderstood,"" ""paranoid delusions,"" ""world is just so rotten to me,"" ""sick of every worthless person,"" ""no issues with myself, but the world never fails to remind me how horrible it is,"" ""All words are meaningless. Every action is malicious."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase ""quick solution"" refers to the *idea* of suicide as a solution, not a concrete plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Suicide has become my quick solution.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all"" combined with ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" strongly indicates a desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post expresses the *idea* of suicide as a solution but lacks any concrete details about *how* or *when* it would be carried out.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings and a current consideration/intention (""Suicide has become my quick solution""). It does not describe past events or past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to end life.
    *   It's not 'Behavior' because, while suicidal thoughts are explicit, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past suicide attempts are described.
    *   The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" This precisely matches the definition of 'Ideation'.

It slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away. I wonder if a long-term cure even exists.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No direct mentions of suicide, dying, or self-harm. The word ""death"" appears in the game title ""death stranding,"" which is not related to the user's suicidal state.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hard to keep going,"" ""badly mangled (psychically),"" ""slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away,"" ""wonder if a long-term cure even exists."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed by depression.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""hard to keep going"" indicates a struggle to cope with life, but it is not an explicit desire to die or end one's life. It falls under general expressions of distress and hopelessness.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. In this case, there is no explicit mention of suicide or desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Not applicable as there is no ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and ongoing feelings and struggles (""Every day feels like the previous one,"" ""It makes it hard to keep going,"" ""It slowly lurks and creeps inside""). No past events or attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly describes significant psychological distress, hopelessness, and the pervasive nature of depression. It expresses a struggle to continue living (""hard to keep going"").
   - However, it *lacks any explicit expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die*. The definition for 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""
   - This post perfectly aligns with the 'Indicator' definition due to the absence of explicit suicidal ideation despite profound distress.

I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""cutting myself"" (past self-harm), ""self mutilation"" (diagnosis related to past self-harm), ""contemplating suicide"" (current ideation), ""undecided if she wants to commit suicide"" (referring to the girl), ""if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" (a pact/agreement for a joint future action), ""I didn't want to live before I met her"" (past desire to die), ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it"" (conditional future intent to die). It also mentions the girl's ""failed attempt to commit suicide"" but this is about another person.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""numb"", ""don't get any joy out of life"", ""don't feel love for anyone"", ""fucking lost here"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" constitutes a pre-arranged agreement or pact for a joint action, which is a form of planning/preparation. ""I'm ending it"" is a direct statement of intent to act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The poster mentions ""cutting myself for a long time"" and being ""covered in scars,"" which is self-harming behavior. However, it's not described as a past suicide attempt by the poster. The ""failed attempt"" refers to the other person.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""contemplating suicide"", ""kill her self"", ""do it together"", ""ending it"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I didn't want to live before I met her"", ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific tool or location, but the phrase ""if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" indicates a concrete agreement or pact to carry out the act jointly, which is a form of planning or preparation for a future action. The statement ""I'm ending it"" is a direct and strong declaration of intent to act.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The agreement to ""do it together"" is a form of preparation (a pact/plan).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes past self-harm (""cutting myself"").
    *   It describes past/current suicidal contemplation (""For the past month I've been contemplating suicide"").
    *   Crucially, it expresses clear *future* intentions and a conditional plan: ""if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"" and ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
    *   **Ideation:** While there is ideation (""contemplating suicide""), the post goes beyond mere thoughts. The agreement to ""do it together"" and the direct statement ""I'm ending it"" (even if conditional) indicate a more concrete step towards action than just thinking about it.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""contemplating suicide"", ""I'm ending it""). It also mentions a plan: the agreement to ""do it together"" if the girl decides to kill herself. This pact is a form of explicit planning/preparation. Additionally, the post explicitly mentions past ""self-harming behavior"" (""cutting myself for a long time,"" ""body is covered in scars""), which is also a component of the 'Behavior' definition. The combination of strong suicidal intent, a conditional plan/pact, and a history of self-harm places it in the 'Behavior' category.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because the poster does not describe a past suicide attempt by *themselves*. The mention of an ""attempt"" refers to the other person.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, numerous mentions by parents (""kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""try to kill yourself again,"" ""cut your wrists again""). These refer to the user's past actions or parental encouragement for the user to commit suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme distress, hopelessness, feeling unwanted, undervalued, and abused. The user's question ""Dad, If you are treating me like this, why did you want to have a daughter in the first place"" clearly indicates deep emotional pain.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Parents mention ""gun,"" ""shoot,"" ""cut your wrists."" However, these are either suggestions from parents or references to the user's *past* actions, not a current plan stated by the user.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, explicitly and repeatedly: ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, repeatedly, both as direct instructions from parents and as references to the user's past actions.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly from the user in the *current* post. The user is recounting parental abuse, which includes references to their past suicidal behaviors.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""gun,"" ""shoot,"" ""cut your wrists.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not from the user in the present context of the post. The methods are linked to past actions or parental abuse.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to past events and interactions. The key phrases ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" clearly indicate *past attempts* by the user. The post does not describe a current plan or intention from the user.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is incorrect because suicide/self-harm is explicitly mentioned and past attempts are described.
   - 'Ideation' is incorrect because the post describes *actions* (past attempts), not just thoughts, and the user doesn't state current ideation.
   - 'Behavior' is incorrect because there is no *current* plan or preparation mentioned by the user. The methods mentioned are in the context of past events or parental abuse.
   - 'Attempt' is the most fitting category. The definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans."" The phrases ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"" and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"" directly refer to concrete past actions/attempts by the person writing the post.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself"", ""Kim's"" (likely a typo for ""kill myself"").
   - Emotional indicators: Desperation (""I just need a way""), clear rejection of help/intervention (""I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is *asking* for a method (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""), but not stating a specific plan they have.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill yourself"", ""Kim's"" (kill myself).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just need a way to Kim's"" (kill myself).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user is *inquiring* about methods, not stating a specific one they intend to use or have prepared.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The user is seeking information on a method, which indicates strong ideation but not yet a concrete plan as defined for 'behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intentions and a desire for future action (""I just need a way to Kim's"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and desired.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
   - Not 'Behavior' because while the user is actively seeking a method, they are not stating a specific plan, method, or preparation they have already identified or acquired. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Asking for a method is different from having one.
   - This fits 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The user clearly expresses a desire to end their life and is looking for *how* to do it, but hasn't presented a specific plan.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal note"" directly mentions suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside"" indicates severe emotional and possibly physical distress.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again."" Writing a suicide note is explicitly listed as a ""preparation taken"" in the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   References to past attempts: ""again"" refers to a past instance of writing a suicidal note, which is a preparation, not a past attempt to end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal note"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Implied by ""suicidal note,"" though not explicitly stated as ""I want to die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a method of dying, but a clear *preparation*: ""writing a suicidal note."" The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the intention to write a ""suicidal note.""
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, the mention of writing a ""suicidal note"" is an explicit preparation, not uncertain.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I think I'm going to write..."" indicates a current/future intention. ""again"" refers to a past instance of writing a note, which reinforces the pattern of preparatory behavior.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past instances of writing a note, which is a preparation, not an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal note"").
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post goes beyond mere thoughts or desires by mentioning a specific *preparation* (""writing a suicidal note""). The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" While a note isn't a method, it's explicitly categorized as a preparation for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior:** This fits well. The post includes explicit expressions related to suicide (""suicidal note"") and mentions a ""preparation taken"" (writing a suicide note), which is directly listed in the definition for 'Behavior'. The ""again"" reinforces this as a recurring preparatory action.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The post describes the *intention* to write a note, not a past *attempt* to end one's life. The ""again"" refers to the note-writing, not a past suicide attempt.

Based on the explicit mention of ""writing a suicidal note"" as a preparation, the category is 'Behavior'.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""slaying myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide/self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: The preceding phrase ""I will end up committing a massacre"" indicates extreme distress, anger, or despair, which contextualizes the suicidal thought.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Slaying myself"" indicates a method (violent self-harm), but it lacks specificity regarding tools, location, or preparations. It's a general intention rather than a concrete plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""slaying myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""slaying myself"" directly expresses a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? ""Slaying myself"" implies a violent method, but it is not specific enough (e.g., it doesn't mention a specific weapon like a knife or gun, or a location).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The phrase ""slaying myself"" describes a *desire* to die by a general violent means, but it does not constitute a *specific plan* with details like tools, locations, or preparations as required by the 'Behavior' definition.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I will end up... or maybe just slaying myself"" refers to future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because it refers to future intentions, not past actions.
   - It contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""slaying myself"").
   - It does not contain a *specific plan* (e.g., specific tool, location, or preparations) as required for 'Behavior'. The phrase ""slaying myself"" is a general statement of intent regarding the *method* of suicide, but not a *plan* with actionable details. According to the rules, if unsure about an explicit plan, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" The term ""suicidal ideation"" is a direct mention.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Why can't I do anything?"", ""I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity""), despair (implied by the struggle with inaction), shame (""my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody""), feeling stupid, overwhelmed, outclassed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post describes a struggle with motivation and inaction, not a plan for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""my suicidal ideation"" is an explicit mention of suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post explicitly states, ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" However, the *acknowledgment* of having ""suicidal ideation"" is key.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""suicidal ideation"" is presented as a past or ongoing internal state (""my suicidal ideation stems from...""), but the current intention is explicitly stated as ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" The presence of the term ""suicidal ideation"" itself, even if the current desire is to live, indicates suicidal thoughts have been present.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly uses the term ""suicidal ideation."" This fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings...""
   - While the user states they ""don't want to die"" currently, the acknowledgment of past or present ""suicidal ideation"" means it goes beyond a mere 'Indicator' (which lacks explicit expression concerning suicide).
   - There is no specific plan or self-harming behavior mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the explicit mention of ""suicidal ideation"" places it firmly in the 'Ideation' category, despite the current desire to live. The post is reflecting on the *existence* of those thoughts, even if the immediate desire is to overcome them.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""shoot myself in the head"", ""don't die"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hesitancy, fear of permanent disability, rejection of help (""not calling a suicide hotline"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"" – this is a specific method (handgun) and target (head). It describes a concrete action the user *wants* to take.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""shoot myself in the head"" is a direct and explicit mention of a suicidal act.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the act of shooting oneself is clearly aimed at ending one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""my dad's handgun"" and ""shoot myself in the head"". This is a very specific means and method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""I wanna get my dad's handgun"" implies an intent to acquire the means, which is a form of planning.
   - The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'."" This post clearly contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I wanna get... and shoot myself"" refers to current desire and future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned with a specific method.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because a specific plan/method (""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"") is articulated. The definition of 'Ideation' explicitly directs to 'Behavior' if specific methods are mentioned.
   - 'Behavior' fits perfectly. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""wanna shoot myself"") and mentions a specific plan/method (""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head""), which includes a specific tool/weapon suitable for ending one's life. The user's hesitancy does not negate the articulation of the plan itself.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past attempt is described; the post discusses current/future intentions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""killing myself,"" or ""self-harm."" Phrases like ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" indicate profound despair and a conditional sense of life being unbearable.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Fuck this World,"" ""unbearable,"" ""helpless, angry and sad,"" ""hate this world,"" ""hate how this world works,"" ""hate the people in my country."" These show severe distress, hopelessness, and anger.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The post expresses a feeling that life is not worth living, but does not use the word ""suicide"" or directly state ""I want to die"" or ""I want to end my life.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrases ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"" (conditional on breathing not returning to normal) express a desire not to continue living *under current conditions*. However, the definition of 'indicator' states: ""Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Given this strict rule, the expressions are not explicit enough to be 'ideation'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes current feelings and future conditional outlook (""If my breathing doesn't go back to normal I can't see myself having a life worth living""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys extreme distress, hopelessness, and a feeling that life is not worth living. However, it *does not explicitly mention suicide* or a direct, unconditional desire to die. The phrases used, while indicative of despair, fall under the 'indicator' definition which emphasizes that ""the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'"" and ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" The post expresses general dissatisfaction and hopelessness about life's value, which aligns with the 'indicator' definition's allowance for ""a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide.""

   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""suicide"", ""If I kill myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"", ""maybe I wasn't cut out for life"", ""I'm done being this sad fucked up person"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Specific methods mentioned: No specific method (e.g., weapon, substance) is mentioned.
   - Signs of preparation: ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out."" This constitutes a specific timeframe for the act and an explicit intention to plan. The ""Behavior"" definition includes ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". Setting a specific date and stating the intent to use time to plan for it falls under ""explicit planning"" or ""preparations taken"", even if the method is not yet decided. This moves it beyond just ideation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current thoughts and future intentions (""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past attempt is described.
   - The choice is between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts. The key differentiator is the presence of a ""specific plan"" or ""preparations"". The statement ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out"" describes a concrete future date for the act and an explicit intention to use the intervening time for planning. This commitment to a timeframe and the intent to plan constitutes ""explicit planning"" as per the 'Behavior' definition, even without a specific method being named. It's more than just a desire; it's a declared intention with a timeline and a commitment to planning.

Now I'm just fighting this battle alone. So what is the point anymore I've failed",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" is a clear, albeit euphemistic, expression of suicidal thoughts. ""So what is the point anymore I've failed"" also indicates a loss of will to live.
   - Emotional indicators: ""darkness of the family,"" ""dealing my depression,"" ""all the bad things that happens to my family is because of me,"" ""I'm a failure,"" ""world worst son, brother, cousin, and uncle,"" ""don't deserve love or happiness,"" ""all I deserve is pain and loneliness,"" ""Burden on my family,"" ""fighting this battle alone."" These show severe depression, self-blame, hopelessness, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""ending it all"" in this context is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""ending it all"" and ""So what is the point anymore"" convey a desire to no longer be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" refers to current and ongoing suicidal thoughts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""ending it all,"" ""what is the point anymore"").
   - It does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide.
   - It does not describe a past suicide attempt.
   - Based on the definitions, ""Ideation"" fits best: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to do this once and for all. I want to get it over with."" (implying ending life), ""my death will be following very soon too."" The phrase ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" directly refers to a suicide attempt.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I feel kind of sorry for my mom though"", ""I hope she learns to cope well"" (indicates concern for others in the context of their own impending death).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend."" (temporal plan). ""It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" (preparation for death).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" is a very direct and explicit reference to a suicide attempt. ""Do this once and for all"" and ""get it over with"" also clearly express a desire to end life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to do this once and for all. I want to get it over with.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., gun, jump, overdose) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" indicates a temporal plan. ""It's probably best if I get a will in place"" is a concrete preparatory action for one's death, explicitly listed as a type of preparation in the 'Behavior' definition (""e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations""). While a will isn't a ""suicide note"" per se, it's a clear preparation for death.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend."" ""my death will be following very soon too.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to end life (""I want to do this once and for all"", ""my death will be following very soon too"", ""attempt this weekend"").
   - It also includes clear signs of planning and preparation: a temporal plan (""this weekend"") and a concrete preparatory action (""get a will in place"").
   - This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)."" While no specific *method* is stated, the *preparation* of a will for one's death and the temporal plan for an ""attempt"" firmly place it in this category. It's more than just ideation because of the planning elements. It's not an attempt because it refers to future actions, not past ones.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""whether or not I'll live till October"", ""i don't wanna die"", ""it's not like i wanna live either"", ""waste money to then die right after"", ""cannot live if i fail"", ""no place to jump from"", ""blades i used to cut won't go that deep"", ""I don't even know how I'll do it"". ""blades i used to cut"" indicates past self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Ambivalence is strong. ""I don't want to"" (fail), ""cannot live if i fail"" indicates despair/hopelessness linked to a specific event. However, also ""for the first time I'm almost happy"", ""almost enjoying doing stuff"", ""feeling better"", ""I want to keep doing things"". This is a conflict between suicidal thoughts and a desire to live.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Methods are *mentioned* (""meds"", ""place to jump from"", ""blades""). However, they are explicitly stated as *unavailable* or *ineffective* (""no access to my meds"", ""no place to jump from"", ""won't go that deep""). The concluding statement ""I don't even know how I'll do it"" confirms a *lack* of a current specific plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""blades i used to cut"" refers to past self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt*. ""The right time is gone"" refers to a past opportunity for suicide, not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""cannot live if i fail"", ""it's not like i wanna live either"", ""waste money to then die right after"". The phrase ""I don't even know how I'll do it"" clearly implies the *idea* of ending one's life. Despite the ambivalence, the suicidal thoughts are present and explicit.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""meds"", ""place to jump from"", ""blades"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Critically, the post states these methods are *not available* or *not effective* and concludes with ""I don't even know how I'll do it"". This indicates a *lack* of a current, viable, specific plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to current thoughts and future intentions (""if i fail"", ""live till October""). Past self-harm is mentioned (""blades i used to cut"") but not a past *suicide attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""cannot live if i fail"", ""I don't even know how I'll do it""), even if conditional and ambivalent.
    *   **Ideation:** This fits. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""desire to not be alive any longer"" conditionally), but explicitly states a *lack* of a specific plan (""I don't even know how I'll do it"" and methods are unavailable/ineffective).
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. While methods are discussed, there is no *specific, current, viable plan* mentioned. The post explicitly states the *absence* of a plan. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies, and in this case, there's a clear *lack* of a plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. Past self-harm is mentioned, but not a concrete past *suicide attempt*.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""drained me the fuck out of all my motivation,"" ""taken my will to strive,"" ""don't know what to do anymore with my life,"" ""exhausted and thrown out."" These indicate extreme fatigue, hopelessness, despair, and a feeling of being lost.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses severe distress and a lack of direction (""I don't know what to do anymore with my life""), but it does not explicitly state a desire to die or not be alive.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is unclear if ""don't know what to do anymore with my life"" implies a desire to end life. Given the instruction to lean towards 'indicator' when explicit mention is unclear, this supports 'indicator'.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': Not applicable as there's no explicit ideation.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and a sense of hopelessness about the future.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The post exhibits significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed and purposeless (""I don't know what to do anymore with my life""). However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive*. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" The rule ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" also applies here. Therefore, 'indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (calculating dosage, testing attachment points, planning for family not to intervene). The post explicitly states, ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""
   - The detailed nature of the planning and preparation is clear.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to both past thoughts/planning (""I've been having suicidal thoughts for years,"" ""I've contemplated and devised,"" ""I've calculated,"" ""I've tested"") and current intentions/state (""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide,"" ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself.""). The current contemplation and possession of detailed plans are key.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out. Suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there are detailed plans.
   - **Ideation:** Ruled out. The post goes far beyond just explicit thoughts/feelings. It includes specific methods, calculations, and tests, which constitute explicit planning and preparation. The definition of Ideation states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""contemplating suicide"") and explicitly mentions a plan to commit suicide with specific methods (""isopropyl alcohol,"" ""noose,"" ""jump in front of car"") and preparations (""calculated how much,"" ""tested strength,"" ""figured out how to ensure family doesn't catch me""). The user explicitly states, ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself."" While the user states they are not acting on it *currently* due to a specific philosophical reason (not deserving death), the *existence* and *detail* of the plans and preparations clearly place it in the 'Behavior' category as per the definition.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past suicide *actions* are described, only past *thoughts* and *planning*.

432,"calling people?. the day i chose is very soon. today i had the urge to call my grandparents, i love them a lot and haven't spoken to them in a while. kind of want to call and talk to them but part of me thinks it might be a bad idea, i don't want them to think the phone call was me trying to be talked down or something. tensions are really high and everything is fucked up in my family but i think they'd be happy to hear from me? i'm on the side of just not calling anyone but i'm not sure if that's the right idea. same with telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother. not sure if that would like, haunt people more or something. what do you guys think?. i know a bunch of people are going to tell me that if i have people that love me i shouldn't kill myself. i'm not interested in being talked down at all, i know i might end up in hell / that whatever comes after this might be worse, i know i'm selfish and weak and all that, i've heard it all and i'm not at all interested in anti suicide discourse. i've wanted to do this for over a decade. i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""the day i chose is very soon,"" and ""i know a bunch of people are going to tell me that if i have people that love me i shouldn't kill myself."" It also mentions ""i'm not interested in being talked down at all,"" and ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade."" The user states, ""i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, and a fixed resolve.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user mentions ""the day i chose is very soon,"" indicating a chosen time. They discuss whether to call loved ones (grandparents, friends) or hug their brother, which can be interpreted as a form of saying goodbye or preparing for a final act. However, no specific *method* (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) or *means-related preparations* (e.g., acquiring tools/substances, specific locations) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The phrase ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"" indicates a long-standing desire/ideation, not a description of a past concrete suicide *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""i shouldn't kill myself.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method (e.g., type of tool, substance, location) is mentioned.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The discussion about calling loved ones and saying goodbyes is a form of preparation, but the 'Behavior' definition's examples for preparations are specific to the *means* of suicide (suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons, suitable locations). The post does not mention these types of preparations. The chosen ""day"" indicates timing, but not the *how*. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to current and future intentions (""the day i chose is very soon,"" ""i'm not interested in being talked down"").
    *   No past attempts are described. ""Wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to persistent ideation, not a past concrete action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. Suicide is explicitly mentioned, and there are clear expressions of wanting to die.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past concrete suicide attempt is described.
    *   **Behavior:** The post expresses strong intent and a chosen timeframe (""the day i chose is very soon""), and discusses emotional preparations (saying goodbyes). However, it lacks the specific details of *how* the suicide would be carried out (method, specific means, tools, or locations). The definition of 'Behavior' emphasizes ""a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons... suitable locations)"". Since these specific details are absent, and given the instruction to ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" 'Behavior' is not the best fit.
    *   **Ideation:** The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to not be alive (""kill myself,"" ""not cut out for life,"" ""can't even imagine mine being worth living,"" ""wanted to do this for over a decade""). While it implies a chosen time and thoughts of saying goodbye, it does not include a specific plan for *how* to commit suicide (method, means, specific location). This aligns perfectly with the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""most suicidal I've been"", ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" (implies a desire to not be alive).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""pain for over 5 years"", ""just cba anymore"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The phrase ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" indicates isolation but not a suicide plan.
    *   References to past attempts: No explicit past attempts are described. ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" refers to a current feeling, not a past action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""most suicidal I've been"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I Just want to be out of my misery"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and intentions (""I Just want to be out of my misery""). ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" describes the current intensity of these feelings.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and a desire to ""be out of my misery,"" which aligns with the definition of 'ideation' (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, a desire to not be alive).
    *   It does not contain any specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past suicide attempt, which rules out 'attempt'.
    *   It goes beyond general distress by explicitly mentioning ""suicidal"" thoughts and a desire to end misery, ruling out 'indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just want to die"", ""Why is it so hard to die"", ""I just want to kill myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Despair, frustration (""Why is it so hard to die"", ""can't find a suitable way to go"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""I can't find a suitable way to go,"" indicating a *lack* of a specific plan or method.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I just want to die"", ""I just want to kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post states the opposite: ""I can't find a suitable way to go"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Given the explicit lack of a plan, this does not fit the 'behavior' category.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current intentions and desires (""I just want to die"", ""I just want to kill myself""). It does not describe past events.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I just want to die"", ""I just want to kill myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   However, it explicitly states ""I can't find a suitable way to go,"" meaning there is no specific plan or method mentioned.
    *   According to the definitions: 'Ideation' is ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""
    *   This post perfectly fits the definition of 'Ideation' because it expresses a strong desire to die/kill oneself but lacks a specific plan.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""low point"", ""shitty grammar"", ""need help aka ADVICE"", ""low self esteem"", ""lonely"", ""worried"". These indicate distress and a desire for guidance to improve life circumstances.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post is asking for advice on moving to another country to improve life.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user is asking if moving to another country is ""worth it"" for ""better living"", implying a desire to continue living and improve their life.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings (""Im in the low point"") and future considerations/questions about improving life (""is it worth moving in another country for better living?""). No past events related to suicide are mentioned.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses general distress, low self-esteem, and loneliness. However, it explicitly asks for ""ADVICE"" on how to improve their life by potentially moving to another country and developing a second language. There is no mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts or plans. According to the definition of 'Indicator', ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This perfectly matches the post.

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Key elements: ""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP"". This is a death wish directed at another person.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""die a horrible painful death"" is mentioned, but it is a wish for someone else, not the poster's own state or intention.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme anger, hostility, desire for harm towards another person.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the poster's own suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not by the poster for themselves. The post expresses a wish for someone else to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the poster is expressing a desire for *another person* to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the poster's own suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a future wish for another person. It does not refer to the poster's past, current, or future suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The crucial rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".
   - The post expresses intense anger and a death wish directed at another individual. There is absolutely no indication, explicit or implicit, that the *poster* is experiencing suicidal thoughts, feelings, or plans.
   - Therefore, according to the definitions, this post lacks any explicit or implicit expression concerning the *poster's* suicide. It fits the definition of 'Indicator' because it does not express suicidal thoughts or feelings *of the poster*.

Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I will kill my bullie,"" ""I will kill her,"" and ""how to murder her."" It also mentions ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others.""
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses significant distress due to bullying (""this women is bullying me and other people with her for couple of years now""), a desire for peace (""to finally live my life in peace"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user *asks* for suggestions on ""how to murder her,"" indicating a lack of a specific plan by the author, but a clear intent towards homicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the phrase ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others"" is present. However, this is a general statement about a type of suicide (murder-suicide), not an expression of the *author's own* suicidal intent. The author's stated intent is to kill *another person*.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The desire is to kill the bully to achieve peace, not to end their own life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user is *soliciting* suggestions for murder methods.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I will kill her,"" ""Do you guys have any suggestion"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The core rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
   - The post expresses clear homicidal ideation and intent, but *not* suicidal ideation or intent on the part of the author.
   - 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' definitions require explicit expressions of *suicidal* thoughts or feelings (desire to not be alive, plans to commit *suicide*). This post does not contain such expressions for the author.
   - 'Attempt' refers to past *suicide* attempts. This is not present.
   - 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" This fits perfectly. While there is distress and a mention of a *type* of suicide, there is no direct expression of the author's own suicidal thoughts or feelings. The intent is outward (homicidal), not inward (suicidal).

I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm on the verge of suicide."", ""kill myself"", ""end it all"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""seriously cannot do this anymore"", ""My mental health really bad"", ""stress"", ""disappointment and failure"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" indicates the user has a plan in mind, but the post does not *describe* any specific method, tool, location, or preparations (e.g., ""I have the pills"", ""I'm going to the bridge"").
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end it all"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I just want to end it all"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping, cutting) is described.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" implies a plan exists in the user's mind. However, the 'Behavior' definition requires the post to ""mention... a plan"" and ""include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"". The post does not *describe* the method or preparations. It only states the *knowledge* of one. According to the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", this leans towards Ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm on the verge of suicide."", ""I just want to end it all"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   It's not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   It's not 'Attempt' because no past attempts are described.
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""I'm on the verge of suicide"", ""I just want to end it all"").
    *   While the user states ""I know exactly what to do,"" the post does not *describe* a specific plan, method, or preparations. The definition of 'Behavior' requires the post to ""include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" Since the specific details of the plan are not mentioned in the post, and following the rule to lean towards 'ideation' when unsure about an explicit plan, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category. The post expresses a strong desire to die and the *knowledge* of how, but not the *description* of the how.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""wanna die"" are direct expressions of a desire for death.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong desire to die, indicating severe distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned by the user themselves. The phrase ""Someone kill me"" is a plea or desire, not a personal plan of action.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill me"" and ""I just wanna die"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post asks for someone else to kill them, but doesn't specify a method, location, or means *they* would use or that is being prepared.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. There is no explicit plan by the individual.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions (""I just wanna die""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned by the person themselves. The request ""Someone kill me"" is a strong expression of ideation, not a concrete plan of action by the poster.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because no past attempts are described.
   - 'Ideation' fits best as the post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""desire to not be alive any longer"") but without any specific plan to commit suicide by the individual.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired of being male attracted to other males,"" ""gender disphoria,"" ""unhappy life,"" ""molested at 5 years,"" ""tired of being unhappy lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed and always rejected,"" ""struggle,"" ""sorry,"" ""negetive out my life."" These indicate significant emotional distress, depression, and a desire for change/relief from current suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a desire to be ""normal,"" to have ""all thoughts away from my mind,"" and for ""all gayness away all gender disphoria all depresion everything negetive out my life."" This is a plea for transformation and relief from suffering, not a wish to end life.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. In this case, it's clear there's no explicit mention of suicide or desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current profound distress and a desire for future change (""make me normal,"" ""never struggle with that again,"" ""take all thoughts away""). It mentions past experiences (""molested at 5 years,"" ""always had unhappy life"") but these are background for the current plea, not descriptions of past suicide attempts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses deep unhappiness, depression, and a strong desire for things to be different (""make me normal,"" ""take all thoughts away,"" ""do a miracle"").
   - However, it *does not* contain any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The plea is for a change in circumstances and internal state, not for an end to existence.
   - According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned."" The user is asking for a miracle to *change* their life and remove negative aspects, not to *end* it. Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' definition.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly asks ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"". This is a direct mention of ""suicidal"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight."" This conveys significant distress, frustration, and hopelessness related to chronic pain.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While phrased as a question to others, the context of the poster's severe, chronic pain (""It hurts... no change in sight"") strongly implies that the poster is experiencing or contemplating suicidal thoughts themselves, linking their pain directly to the concept of being ""suicidal."" The explicit use of the term ""suicidal"" moves it beyond a general expression of distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current ongoing pain and potential current suicidal feelings.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because ""suicidal"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - **Ideation:** This is the best fit. The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" thoughts in the context of the poster's personal struggle, indicating explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings, but without any specific plan. The rule ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" is addressed by the strong implication that the poster is grappling with such thoughts, given their direct question and description of their pain. The explicit use of ""suicidal"" is key.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I don't think I can go on much longer."" (Implies ending life)
        *   ""I'm over life."" (Explicit desire to end life)
        *   ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" (Suggests a final task before ending life)
        *   ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"" (Explicit desire for death)
        *   ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life"" (Reference to suicide of another person, providing context for their own thoughts)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness, despair, loneliness, feeling abandoned, mental exhaustion, guilt.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This is a crucial phrase. While not a specific *method* of suicide, it indicates a *preparatory action* or a *final task* that needs to be completed before the intended end. This implies a form of planning or a sequence of events leading to suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None by the person writing the post.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""I'm over life,"" ""its finally over"" (in context of ending life), ""give in to the nothingness that is death.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""One last record for me to make and its finally over."" This indicates a *preparatory step* or a *final condition* before the intended suicidal act. The 'Behavior' definition includes ""preparations taken."" This phrase fits that criterion as it describes a specific action to be completed before the stated end.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current feelings and future intentions (""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""I'm over life,"" ""One last record for me to make and its finally over,"" ""I am looking forward to...death""). There is a past reference to someone else's suicide, but the poster's own suicidal ideation and implied plan are present/future oriented.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit mentions of suicide and desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post includes more than just thoughts; it mentions a specific preparatory action (""One last record for me to make and its finally over"") before the intended end.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'm over life,"" ""looking forward to...death"") and also mentions a form of preparation or a specific task to be completed before the suicidal act (""One last record for me to make and its finally over""). This goes beyond mere ideation by implying a concrete step or condition before the act.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no description of a past suicide attempt by the poster.

The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" is key. It signifies a planned, final action before the intended end, which falls under the ""preparations taken"" aspect of the 'Behavior' definition, even if the specific method of death is not stated.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die""
   - Emotional indicators: ""pain"", ""hurt"", ""stupid"", ""belittles me"" - indicates distress, anger, and a desire for retribution.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it."" - This explicitly states a lack of a specific plan or method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I want to die"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"" indicates no specific method or location is planned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, there is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention (""I want to die"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I want to die""), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'. However, it explicitly states a lack of a specific plan or method (""Not sure how much but wherever it is""), which means it does not fit 'Behavior'. There are no mentions of past attempts, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, it perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I've started to try and starve myself"" (explicit self-harm/method)
        *   ""won't be as painful as hanging myself"" (explicit mention of a suicide method)
        *   ""I'd prefer having access to a gun though, at least that would be quicker, painless, and more deadly."" (explicit mention of a desired suicide method and desire for death)
        *   ""if I keep starving myself I'll at least be dead by the end of the week."" (explicit mention of death by a specific method with a timeline)
        *   ""I just want my death to come faster"" (explicit desire for death)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""lost everything important,"" ""useless,"" ""can't do anything right,"" ""nuisance,"" ""hopelessness,"" ""despair.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""I've started to try and starve myself"" (This indicates an *active* and *ongoing* method/preparation).
        *   ""dead by the end of the week"" (This provides a timeline for the ongoing method).
        *   ""hanging myself"" (mentioned as a less preferred but considered method).
        *   ""access to a gun"" (desired method, implying seeking means).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are described. The starvation is current and ongoing.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""hanging myself,"" ""access to a gun,"" and the desire for ""death to come faster"" clearly indicate suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just want my death to come faster,"" ""I'll at least be dead by the end of the week.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""access to a gun.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I've started to try and starve myself"" is an active, ongoing preparation/behavior. The statement ""if I keep starving myself I'll at least be dead by the end of the week"" links this ongoing action to a specific outcome and timeline.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions. ""I've started to try and starve myself"" is current action. ""dead by the end of the week"" is a future outcome based on current action. ""want my death to come faster"" is a current desire for a future event. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning specific methods (""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""gun"") and, crucially, describes an *ongoing action* (""I've started to try and starve myself"") with a projected timeline (""dead by the end of the week""). This active engagement in a method, even if slow, constitutes a plan or self-harming behavior as per the 'Behavior' definition (""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken"").
    *   It does not describe a *past* suicide attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

Based on the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, specific methods, and an ongoing self-harming behavior with a timeline, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just don't want to go on anymore."" (desire to end life/current state), ""My life has already been over for six years now"" (feeling of life being over), ""I plan my suicide every single day."" (explicit mention of suicide and planning).
   - Emotional indicators: Melancholy, tired, can't feel anything, want to cry, bottomless pit, angry, grief, rage, bitterness, hurting. High levels of distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I plan my suicide every single day."" (ongoing planning), ""using a pistol"" (specific method), ""an escape bag"" (potential preparation), ""douse myself in gasoline and light up"" (specific method).
   - References to past attempts: None. ""My life has already been over for six years now"" is a metaphorical expression of feeling, not a past attempt. ""Old injuries"" and ""nerve damage"" refer to physical issues.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I plan my suicide every single day.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just don't want to go on anymore."" and the explicit suicide planning.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. ""using a pistol"", ""douse myself in gasoline and light up"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I plan my suicide every single day"" indicates ongoing mental planning and the mention of ""realistic and practical plans"". ""An escape bag"" could also be interpreted as preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions. ""I plan my suicide every single day"" refers to an ongoing current activity with future intent.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and specific plans/methods are detailed.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out because the post goes beyond just thoughts/feelings and includes specific plans and methods. The definition for 'Ideation' explicitly states ""without any specific plan"".
   - 'Behavior' is the best fit. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""I plan my suicide every single day"") and clearly mentions specific plans and methods (""using a pistol,"" ""douse myself in gasoline and light up""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' which requires explicit thoughts and a plan/method.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as there is no description of a past completed or interrupted suicide action. The content focuses on current planning.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I can't go on like this,"" ""my life is just full of rape, abuse and suffering""), despair, feeling dirty, isolated (""I have nobody"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   Current: ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" This describes a specific method (hanging) and the act of preparing/initiating it.
        *   Current intention: ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it."" This indicates a current plan to act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Multiple explicit descriptions of past attempts: ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists,"" ""When I was 19 I laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over,"" ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train."" The phrase ""But everytime I try I fail"" confirms these were attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, for current intent: ""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" (hanging). For past attempts: cutting wrists, being run over by a car, jumping in front of a train.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" is a direct sign of preparation and initiation of a method. ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"" indicates a planned sequence.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

        *   Current/future intentions: ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" (a current action, though aborted), ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"" (a current intention/plan).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly goes beyond 'Indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions and plans.
    *   It goes beyond 'Ideation' because it describes a specific current method/preparation (""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"") and a current plan (""then do it""). This would qualify it for 'Behavior'.
    *   However, the 'Attempt' definition states: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'. **Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.**""
    *   This post explicitly describes multiple past suicide attempts (cutting wrists, laying on road, jumping in front of a train) AND mentions a current, aborted action with a method (""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"") and a current intention/plan (""then do it"").

The word ""suicidal"" is used in a question, not as a direct statement of intent. The expressions about dying are passive acceptance, not active desire to cause death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I feel like I'm at the point in my life"", ""future is really grim"" - indicates hopelessness and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states, ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it"". It mentions ""stopped visiting the doctor's"", which is a form of self-neglect or passive acceptance, but not an active plan to commit suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicidal"" is used in a question (""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?""). This is a query about whether their passive state constitutes suicide, not a direct declaration of suicidal intent.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The user expresses a passive acceptance of death (""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come"") and a lack of desire to prolong life (""not worth pushing my life further""). However, they explicitly state ""I don't have any plans to end it"". The definition of 'ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". The post expresses a *willingness to accept death* and *not push for life*, but not an explicit desire to *actively cause* death or *commit* suicide. Given the rule ""If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'"" and ""When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"", the lack of explicit desire to *commit* suicide (as opposed to passively accepting death) points towards 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No. The ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" is a passive action, not a preparation for an active suicide attempt. The post explicitly states ""I don't have any plans to end it"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to current feelings and intentions (""As of right now"", ""I feel like I'm at the point""). No past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains general expressions of distress and a vague feeling about dying/death, and a passive acceptance of it.
    *   It *asks* about being suicidal, but does not *state* ""I am suicidal"" or ""I want to commit suicide.""
    *   Crucially, it explicitly states ""I don't have any plans to end it.""
    *   There is no explicit desire to *actively end* one's life, only a passive willingness to accept its end.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'Indicator' fits because it lacks explicit expression concerning suicide as an active desire/plan, despite general distress and vague feelings about death. The explicit statement ""I don't have any plans to end it"" and the framing of ""Is it suicidal..."" as a question rather than a statement of intent, align with 'indicator'.
        *   'Ideation' requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"". While there's a desire not to *prolong* life, the explicit statement about no plans to *end* it, and the passive nature of the acceptance of death, makes it fall short of the explicit desire to *commit* suicide required for 'ideation'. The rule ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'"" is key here.
        *   'Behavior' is ruled out due to the explicit lack of a plan.
        *   'Attempt' is ruled out as no past attempts are described.

    Therefore, based on the strict definitions and the ""when in doubt"" rules, 'indicator' is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""thinking about suicide"" but it refers to ""a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide,"" not the author themselves.
   - Emotional indicators: The post discusses ""struggling"" in a general context of helping others, not indicating the author's own distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the author for themselves.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned by the author for themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the author of the post about themselves. The author is giving advice on how to help others who might be suicidal.
   - The key rule is ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" Therefore, the mention of suicide is not an explicit expression *from the author* about their own suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post is general advice for helping others, not referring to the author's own past events or current/future intentions regarding suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post discusses suicide, but it is entirely in the context of providing advice on how to help a friend who is struggling with suicidal thoughts.
   - The author is not expressing their own suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts.
   - According to the rule ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned,"" this post does not indicate suicidal risk for the author.
   - The definition of 'Indicator' states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings."" While the word ""suicide"" is present, it is not an expression *from the author* about their own suicidal thoughts or feelings.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances intended for suicide) are mentioned. No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring specific means for suicide). The mention of stopping medication and drinking heavily is about current coping/deterioration, not a suicide plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None. The post focuses on current feelings and potential future actions/thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""killing myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""no reason to live,"" ""it's time to die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post describes a general desire to die and a feeling of contentment with the idea of suicide, but no specific way how this would be achieved.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. There are no mentions of acquiring means, writing notes, or choosing a specific location for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings and future intentions/thoughts (""I feel like I am finally becoming content with that,"" ""will only drive me further to killing myself,"" ""it's time to die""). No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits the description perfectly. The post ""includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""no reason to live,"" ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""killing myself,"" ""time to die""). However, it is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" There are no details about *how* the person would end their life.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. The post does not include ""a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior"" *as a method for suicide*. While stopping medication and drinking heavily are self-harming behaviors, they are not described as the *means* of suicide, nor is there any other specific plan. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'."" In this case, there is no explicit plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The content does not describe any past attempts at suicide.

Based on the explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and desires without any specific plan or method, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate classification.

451,"Is drowning yourself painful?. As the title says. I think its the best option for me, its basically a guaranteed death is it not? Sounds rather peaceful actually, slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean as you see a light at the end of the tunnel. A nice smooth transition to death. If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""drowning yourself"", ""guaranteed death"", ""transition to death"", ""go and do that"" (referring to drowning).
   - Emotional indicators: Expresses a desire for death (""best option for me"", ""peaceful"", ""nice smooth transition"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""drowning yourself"" (method), ""bottom of the ocean"" (location). The statement ""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that"" indicates a conditional future intention to execute this specific plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""drowning yourself"" is a direct and explicit mention of a suicide method.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I think its the best option for me"", ""guaranteed death"", ""nice smooth transition to death"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""drowning yourself"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation, but a specific method and location (""bottom of the ocean"") are identified, and a conditional intent to act on it is stated. This constitutes a specific plan.
   - The definition for 'Behavior' states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knives/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by)."" ""Drowning yourself"" is a specific method, and ""bottom of the ocean"" is a suitable location.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current thoughts and future intentions (""I think its the best option for me"", ""If I get kicked out... I think I might go and do that""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is too low, as suicide is explicitly mentioned with a desire to die.
   - 'Ideation' is too low, as a specific method (""drowning yourself"") and a specific location (""bottom of the ocean"") are mentioned, which constitutes a plan. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - 'Behavior' fits because the post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and mentions a specific method (""drowning yourself"") and a suitable location (""bottom of the ocean"") as a plan, even if conditional.
   - 'Attempt' is incorrect as no past attempt is described.

452,"Is life actually worth living anymore?. We've been in this pandemic for a year now and very little, if anything, seems to have improved. I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore. I can barely sleep without waking up in the middle of the night for no obvious reason. I think it's time for me to accept defeat.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly asks ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"", states ""I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out"", ""I don't see what there is to live for"", ""Surely, I can just call it quits now?"", and ""Death seems a better option to me than living in this world"". These are clear expressions related to ending life or preferring death.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, feeling overwhelmed, exhaustion, lack of resilience (""I don't know if I can take it anymore"", ""COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience"", ""I fear that I will never see the world"", ""I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'"", ""I can hardly function anymore"", ""I think it's time for me to accept defeat"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. There are no details about *how* the user would commit suicide, only the contemplation and desire to do so.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out."", ""I don't see what there is to live for."", ""Death seems a better option to me than living in this world.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post expresses a strong desire to end life and explicitly considers suicide, but provides no details of a plan or method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and intentions (""Is life actually worth living anymore?"", ""I don't know if I can take it anymore"", ""I don't want to live"", ""Death seems a better option to me""). There is no description of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there are direct expressions of wanting to die.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The user contemplates suicide and expresses a desire to die, but no 'how'.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly as the post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

453,Star Wars just gave me a reason not to kill myself :). So Disney just announced they'll be releasing a Star Wars dozen films/tv shows in the coming years and it's all I've ever wanted in life :) That should hopefully postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so lol. I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""not to kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"".
   - Emotional indicators: The primary emotion is excitement about Star Wars, which is presented as a reason to *postpone* suicidal actions. This implies an underlying struggle with suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post is about *avoiding* or *delaying* such actions.
   - References to past attempts: ""postpone any suicide attempts"" implies that suicide attempts are a consideration or a recurring thought/potential action for the user. However, it does *not* describe a concrete past action or event where an attempt occurred. It's more about delaying future potential actions.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post states a reason *not* to kill oneself, but the very need for such a reason implies that suicidal thoughts are present and active. The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" directly indicates that suicide attempts are a current or recurring consideration for the user.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current thoughts and future intentions (""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade""). While ""attempts"" (plural) might hint at past considerations, it does not describe a concrete past *action* that happened. The focus is on the *postponement* of potential future actions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"").
   - **Ideation:** The post explicitly states ""not to kill myself"" and ""postpone any suicide attempts"". This clearly indicates explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings (the need to postpone implies they are present), but without any specific plan or method. The phrase ""suicide attempts"" being something to ""postpone"" strongly suggests a desire to not be alive or a contemplation of ending one's life, which is being temporarily overridden. This fits the definition of ideation.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. The post is about *not* acting on suicidal thoughts for now.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out. While ""suicide attempts"" is mentioned, it is in the context of *postponing* them, not describing a concrete past action that occurred. The definition for 'attempt' requires a ""concrete action need to have happened in the past"". The phrasing ""postpone any suicide attempts"" refers to delaying potential future actions or ongoing considerations, not describing a specific historical event.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit as it captures the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts/feelings without a plan.

    *   **Ideation:** This category fits best. The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""no will to live anymore,"" ""want to end it all"") but *without* any specific plan or method.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan (e.g., method, location, tools) or preparations.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""smell of a Dead Body,"" but this is attributed to a false report by the landlord, not the user's own state or suicidal intent. There are no mentions of suicide or self-harm.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""I'm so tired,"" ""My heads messing with me,"" ""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""it's hard to deal,"" ""I cant take this torture from these people,"" ""I want to leave,"" ""I have no money to just walk out or i would,"" ""I dont know what options I have left,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs."" These indicate extreme exhaustion, distress, paranoia, feeling trapped, and hopelessness regarding their current living situation.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user expresses a strong desire to ""leave this place"" and ""walk out,"" which refers to their current living situation, not ending their life. The phrase ""I dont know what options I have left"" indicates desperation and feeling trapped, but not an explicit desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current distress and a desire to escape their living situation. No mention of past attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post clearly conveys significant distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped. However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive*. The desire to ""leave"" is directed at their physical location/situation, not ending their life. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits the 'Indicator' definition perfectly as it expresses general distress and hopelessness without any explicit suicidal thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Possible suicide date is in July."" This is a direct mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""My parents don't love me,"" ""I have nobody :),"" ""Too bad I'm fucking debating it,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope',"" ""I don't even know who I am anymore if I'm being honest."" These indicate profound sadness, loneliness, hopelessness, and identity confusion.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A ""Possible suicide date is in July"" is mentioned. This is a temporal aspect of a plan, but no specific method (e.g., how, where) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are detailed. The phrase ""debating it"" suggests the plan is not firm or acted upon.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Possible suicide date is in July.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the mention of a ""suicide date"" implies a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tools, locations, substances) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned.
   - The post mentions a *date*, which is an element of a plan, but the 'Behavior' definition requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The absence of a method or preparation, combined with ""debating it,"" prevents it from fitting 'Behavior'. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" is relevant here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to a future intention (""Possible suicide date is in July"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out as there's no mention of past suicidal actions.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because, while a date is mentioned, there is no specific method or preparation described. The phrase ""debating it"" also indicates a lack of firm commitment to a concrete action plan. The definition for 'Behavior' specifically asks for ""a specific method or preparations taken"".
   - 'Ideation' fits best: The content includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""Possible suicide date is in July"") but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide"" in terms of method or preparation. The mention of a date indicates strong ideation and a progression towards planning, but it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' due to the lack of method/preparation details and the ""debating it"" aspect.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states the person will ""probably never kill myself"" due to religious reasons, which indicates a lack of plan.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and future intentions (""will always be"", ""will probably never kill myself"", ""hope that my life will get better""). No past attempts are mentioned.
5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - ""Indicator"" is incorrect because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - ""Behavior"" is incorrect because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation. In fact, the post states the opposite (""will probably never kill myself"").
   - ""Attempt"" is incorrect because no past attempt is described.
   - ""Ideation"" is the correct category as the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts"") but without any specific plan or method to act on them.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide notes.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""ending it all,"" ""can't fucking do another year.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *method* of dying (e.g., jumping, overdose) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" The definition of 'Behavior' explicitly lists ""suicide note"" as a sign of preparation. The phrase ""this is the one"" implies the current note is intended for an imminent act.
    *   If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. In this case, the mention of ""suicide notes"" and ""this is the one"" constitutes explicit planning/preparation according to the 'Behavior' definition.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past preparations (""made 3 other suicide notes"") and current/future intentions (""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve,"" ""this is the one""). The focus is on the current intent and preparation for a future act.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, past *preparations* (notes) are described, not past *attempts*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit mention of suicide and plans/preparations.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out because the post goes beyond mere thoughts/desires. It includes a temporal plan (""on new year's eve"") and explicit preparation (""suicide notes,"" ""this is the one"").
    *   **Behavior:** This fits best. The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""ending it all,"" ""can't fucking do another year"") and mentions a plan/preparations. The definition states: ""It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. suicide note...)."" The mention of ""suicide notes"" and the intent behind ""this is the one"" clearly fall under ""preparations taken."" The temporal aspect (""on new year's eve"") further solidifies the planning aspect.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as it describes future intentions and past preparations, not a past completed physical action.

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I tried to cut myself last night."" This is a direct mention of self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""during a breakdown,"" ""very bad night,"" and ""wanted to feel something real"" indicate significant emotional distress and a coping mechanism for it.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A method (""cut myself"") is mentioned, and it refers to a past action. No current plans or preparations are indicated.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I tried to cut myself last night"" directly describes a past action. ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" reinforces that this was a new, past event.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The post describes self-harm, but doesn't explicitly state an intention to die or commit suicide. The stated motivation was ""wanted to feel something real.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut myself."" This method was *tried* in the past.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Not for a *current* plan. The action was already taken.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""last night"" clearly indicates a past event.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is too mild as a concrete act of self-harm is described.
    *   **Ideation:** This category refers to thoughts/feelings without a specific plan or action. An action (""tried to cut myself"") occurred, so this is not appropriate.
    *   **Attempt:** This category is for ""past attempts at suicide."" While a concrete action (""tried to cut myself"") happened in the past, the post explicitly states the motivation was ""wanted to feel something real,"" not explicitly to die. This suggests non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) rather than a direct suicide attempt. If the intent was not suicide, this category is not the best fit.
    *   **Behavior:** This category states, ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior."" The post *does* describe ""self-harming behavior"" (""tried to cut myself""). While the action occurred in the past, the post *exhibits* or describes this behavior. Given that the intent was not explicitly suicidal (as per the ""wanted to feel something real"" statement), and 'Attempt' is specifically for *suicide* attempts, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category for describing a past act of self-harm where suicidal intent is not explicitly stated as the primary goal. The definition of 'Behavior' does not strictly limit ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" to only *current* acts.

Considering the nuance between self-harm and suicide attempts, and the stated motivation, 'Behavior' best captures the described action without assuming explicit suicidal intent for the past action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""lost feelings for me"", ""became toxic"", ""nothing and no one"", ""no purpose to live"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post states ""plan to kill myself"" but *does not* specify *how* (e.g., method, location, tools, substances). It's a statement of intent, but not a detailed plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""plan to kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""no purpose to live nor do i see a purpose of living"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post says ""plan to kill myself"" but does not provide any details about the method, means, or location.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The rule ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" is relevant here. The post expresses a *desire* or *intent* to end life, but not a *specific, actionable plan* with details.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""plan to kill myself"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - **Ideation:** The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live"") and a desire to not be alive. However, it *lacks* any specific plan (method, means, location, preparations). This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific method or preparation mentioned. The definition for 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The post says ""plan to kill myself"" but does not detail *how*.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' category as it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing yourself soon"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The user discusses the act in a detached, almost logistical way, focusing on the impact on others (""make the process, for them, easier""). The statement ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"" indicates a strong sense of hopelessness regarding intervention.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method, location, or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing yourself soon"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""killing yourself soon"" directly expresses this intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post discusses the *act* of killing oneself, but not *how* or *where* or *with what*. The instruction ""If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" applies here.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""soon"" indicates a future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - **Ideation:** The post contains a clear and explicit expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to end one's life (""killing yourself soon""). However, it lacks any specific plan (method, tools, location, preparations). This perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation'.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan (method, tools, location) or preparations. The rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"" confirms this.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'll kill myself tonight"", ""I want to kill myself so bad"", ""hang myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""Fuckkkkkkk"", ""I'm so fucking tired of everything"", ""god damn it"" – indicate extreme distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""hang myself at the woods"". ""Play my favorite music ever"" could be seen as a preparation/ritual.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""hang myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I'll kill myself tonight"", ""I want to kill myself so bad"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"".
   - Are specific locations mentioned? Yes, ""at the woods"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""play my favorite music ever"" (implies a final act/ritual). The method and location are explicit and suitable for ending one's life.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I'll kill myself tonight"" indicates a current/future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states a desire to ""kill myself"" and ""hang myself"", ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - It goes beyond just expressing suicidal thoughts (Ideation) by providing a specific method (""hang myself"") and a location (""at the woods""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' which requires ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" including ""a specific method or preparations taken"" and ""suitable locations"".
   - There is no mention of a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to kill myself"" - explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""truly alone forever,"" ""struggled daily with loneliness,"" ""no gf , friends,"" ""What a joke,"" ""I hate pets,"" ""I want to kill myself."" - indicates severe distress, hopelessness, and isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching."" This is a specific temporal plan. ""Already started to cancel friendships."" This is a clear preparatory action.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I want to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Already started to cancel friendships."" and ""already set a date"". These are explicit elements of planning and preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current intention (""I want to kill myself"") and future intentions with a timeline (""set a date... and I'm approaching"") and ongoing preparatory actions (""started to cancel friendships"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself"").
   - It also includes clear elements of planning (""already set a date"") and preparatory actions (""Already started to cancel friendships"").
   - According to the definitions, 'Behavior' includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts *and* mentions a plan or exhibits self-harming behavior, including preparations. Setting a date and cancelling friendships are explicit preparations for a future act.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because there is a plan/preparation beyond just thoughts.
   - It is not 'Attempt' as it describes future intent and preparation, not a past completed action.
   - It is not 'Indicator' as suicide is explicitly mentioned and planned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""so i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""This life doesnt fit me. It never did"", ""i dont like this shithole i live in but i cant change it."" (hopelessness, dissatisfaction, feeling trapped).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The phrase ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" describes a coping mechanism to *avoid* suicide, not a plan for it.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" are explicitly mentioned.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the context of ""This life doesnt fit me"" and the need to ""sleep all day... so i dont kill myself"" strongly implies a desire to escape current suffering, and the questioning of suicide's badness (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death"") indicates contemplation of ending one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""This life doesnt fit me"", ""i have to so i dont kill myself"", ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide and expresses a desire to escape a life that doesn't fit, even using a coping mechanism to prevent suicide. This goes beyond general distress.
   - However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The post is about contemplating suicide and preventing it through coping, not enacting it.
   - There are no past attempts described.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

   - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, self-deprecation (""too much of a coward"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" explicitly indicates a *lack* of action or plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""I want to die"" is a direct and explicit expression of a desire to end one's life, which falls under suicidal thoughts/feelings.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"" is a direct expression.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The statement ""I'm too much of a coward to do it"" implies no current plan or preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention/feeling (""I want to die"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The text explicitly states the *lack* of action.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly. The post includes ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer,"" but ""without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Goodbye,"" ""throw myself off a bridge,"" ""last vent,"" ""suicidal,"" ""self-harmed,"" ""dying,"" ""last few seconds.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I cant take it,"" ""hated myself,"" ""tired of everything,"" ""at peace, no longer in pain.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""throw myself off a bridge"" (specific method), ""Ive planned it all out"" (explicit planning), ""locked in the bathroom"" (preparation/location for immediate action).
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""suicidal since i was 9,"" ""self-harmed."" These are past experiences/behaviors, but ""self-harmed"" is not explicitly described as a past *suicide attempt* (e.g., an overdose that failed). The ""suicidal since 9"" indicates past ideation, not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""decide to throw myself off a bridge,"" ""suicidal,"" ""dying.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I cant take it,"" ""hated myself and i was tired of everything around me,"" ""throw myself off a bridge.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""throw myself off a bridge.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Ive planned it all out,"" and being ""locked in the bathroom"" suggests immediate intent and isolation for the act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post refers to both past experiences (""suicidal since i was 9,"" ""self-harmed"") and *current/future intentions* (""This is probably going to become a throw-away account, possibly my last vent before i littitimatly decide to throw myself off a bridge,"" ""Ive planned it all out,"" ""this is just a way of dying""). The present tense ""I am at peace, no longer in pain, locked in the bathroom"" strongly indicates current, imminent intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by explicitly mentioning a specific method (""throw myself off a bridge"") and stating that a plan has been made (""Ive planned it all out""). This clearly fits the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   While past self-harm and being suicidal are mentioned, no concrete past *suicide attempt* (like an overdose or jumping attempt) is described. The primary focus is on the *current* plan and intent. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not the best fit as the core of the post is about the current planned action, not a past one.

Based on the explicit mention of a specific method and planning, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm gonna commit suicide."", ""die of blood loss.""
    *   Emotional indicators: High distress, hopelessness (implied by suicidal intent).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""twist my dick off"" (likely metaphorical for self-harm/extreme pain, but points to self-destructive intent), ""die of blood loss"" by ""wait it off"". This describes a method of causing death.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm gonna commit suicide.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""die of blood loss.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""die of blood loss"" following a self-inflicted injury (""twist my dick off"" / ""wait it off""). While the initial phrasing is bizarre and likely hyperbolic, the intent to cause a fatal injury leading to blood loss is stated as a method. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""a specific method"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparations (like notes or acquiring specific tools), but the method is described.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm gonna commit suicide."", ""I'm gonna wait it off a die of blood loss."").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Not 'Attempt' because it describes future actions, not past attempts.
    *   It explicitly states suicidal intent (""I'm gonna commit suicide"").
    *   It also describes a *method* of suicide (""die of blood loss"" from self-inflicted injury). This moves it beyond mere ideation (a desire to die) into the realm of describing *how* the person intends to die, which aligns with the 'Behavior' definition requiring ""a specific method"". The bizarre nature of the method does not negate its explicit mention as a plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post uses ""Sayonara"" (goodbye forever), states ""I will eventually die in a much painful way,"" and explicitly says ""I have no reason to live."" While ""suicide"" isn't used, ""no reason to live"" is a strong indicator of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Sayonara,"" ""disease getting worse,"" ""body getting weaker,"" ""painful way,"" ""endured physical pain and mental depression for years,"" ""lonely,"" ""no reason to live."" These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, and a sense of giving up.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""I have no reason to live"" is a direct expression of not wanting to continue living. ""Sayonara"" reinforces this as a farewell. The definition for 'Ideation' states: ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". ""No reason to live"" clearly falls under this.
    *   **If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.** In this case, the expression ""no reason to live"" is sufficiently direct to indicate a desire to not be alive, moving it beyond a vague ""indicator.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** There is no explicit plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""Sayonara"" and ""I have no reason to live"" refer to current feelings and a potential future intention to end life. The description of the disease and suffering provides context for these current feelings.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to not be alive (""I have no reason to live,"" ""Sayonara"").
    *   It does *not* contain any specific plan or method.
    *   It does *not* describe a past attempt.
    *   It is more than just general distress or vague feelings about death (which would be 'Indicator') because of the direct statement ""no reason to live.""
    *   Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""I'm starting to get envious,"" ""I'll still be suicidal lol""). It does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""Why can't that be me?""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation (e.g., how, where, or with what means). This rules out 'Behavior' as per the definition: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits the 'Ideation' definition: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

472,"Idk how to word this without sounding dumb. Am I the only one who wants to die but is still afraid of stupid little things like going to hell or something? Like at this point I am and have done some bad shit so I'm probably doing there anyways so it shouldn't matter, but I keep worrying about it. The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."". Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff. I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""Am I the only one who wants to die"". This is a direct expression of a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Idk how to word this without sounding dumb,"" ""afraid of stupid little things,"" ""worrying about it,"" ""feeling really isolated recently,"" ""can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist."" These indicate distress, fear, isolation, and difficulty coping.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The user discusses the *desire* to die, but not *how* or *what* they would do.
   - References to past attempts: No references to past attempts are made.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrase ""wants to die"" is a direct and explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Am I the only one who wants to die"".
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': It is not unclear; the desire to die is explicit.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit planning mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is an explicit expression of wanting to die.
   - **Ideation:** The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""wants to die"") and a desire to not be alive, but it does not include any specific plan (method, means, location, or preparations). This perfectly matches the definition of 'Ideation'.
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparations.

For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"". It also mentions ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" and ""he is the only reason im alive right now,"" which implies a desire not to be alive if not for that reason. The phrase ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" suggests a limit to their ability to continue living under current circumstances.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""crushed by stress,"" ""cried myself to sleep,"" ""anxiety,"" ""crippled by stress and anxiety,"" ""no motivation,"" ""bottled up,"" ""I need help and I can't get it from anywhere."" These indicate significant distress and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. There is no mention of tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquiring means.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""I thought of killing myself multiple times,"" which refers to past *thoughts* or *ideation*, not past *actions* or *attempts*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""the only reason im alive right now"" and ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" strongly imply a desire not to continue living in their current state.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" refers to past *thoughts*.
    *   ""he is the only reason im alive right now"" and ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" refer to current feelings and future uncertainty, indicating ongoing suicidal ideation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""I thought of killing myself multiple times"") and a current desire not to be alive (""the only reason im alive right now"", ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"").
    *   There is no mention of any specific plan (method, location, means) or preparations for suicide.
    *   It describes past *thoughts* of suicide, not past *attempts* (actions).
    *   Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category, which is defined as ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""how to die"", ""definitely die""
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness, desperation, indifference to suffering (""I don't care if it's slow or painful or both"")
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is asking *where* to find out how to die, indicating a search for a method, but not stating a specific plan or method they possess or intend to use.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, by asking ""Where can I find out how to die"" and stating ""I just want to definitely die"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to definitely die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The user is *seeking* information on methods, but not stating a method they have identified or prepared.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. The post expresses a strong desire to die and a proactive step to find a method, but it does not *state* a specific method or plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current and future intentions (""I just want to definitely die"", ""Where can I find out how to die"").
   - No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because there are explicit mentions of wanting to die and seeking means to die.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past actions are described.
   - Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The post clearly expresses a strong desire to die (""I just want to definitely die"") and is actively seeking information on *how* to die (""Where can I find out how to die""). This is beyond just vague thoughts and shows a strong intent to move towards action. However, the definition of 'Behavior' requires the post to *mention* a specific plan or exhibit self-harming behavior. While asking for methods is a step towards planning, the post itself does not *state* a specific method or preparation. It's a desire to die *and* a search for a method, but not yet a stated method. Following the rule ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"", this falls into 'Ideation'. The desire to die is explicit, and the search for methods is a manifestation of that ideation, but not a concrete plan *mentioned in the post*.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" refers to current thoughts and potential future intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there are explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""getting it over with,"" ""he'll be better off without me"").
   - 'Behavior' is ruled out because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out because there is no mention of a past suicide attempt.
   - 'Ideation' fits perfectly: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""desire to not be alive any longer"") without any specific plan to commit suicide.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly mentions ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die,"" ""scared of dying."" Describes past actions intended to cause death (""took 120 extra strength aspirin pills,"" ""purchased a gun,"" ""purchased rope,"" ""partial suspension hanging""). Describes current preparations for suicide (""exit bag set up,"" ""turned that gas valve"").
   - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""panicked,"" ""hurt,"" ""shock,"" ""lonely,"" ""anxious,"" ""sad,"" ""exhausted,"" ""despair,"" ""numb,"" ""empty.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations:
     - Past: ""120 extra strength aspirin pills,"" ""purchased a gun,"" ""where to aim it on my head,"" ""purchased rope,"" ""partial suspension hanging,"" ""noose positioning,"" ""remote location.""
     - Current: ""exit bag set up,"" ""turned that gas valve,"" ""this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right).""
   - References to past attempts: Yes, multiple detailed descriptions of past actions taken with the intent to die:
     - At 15: ""took 120 extra strength aspirin pills.""
     - At 21: ""purchased a gun... found where to aim it on my head... chambered my round.""
     - ""Just recently"": ""purchased rope... read up on partial suspension hanging... got into a remote location and went with the plan.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""desire to die.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, for current intentions: ""exit bag set up,"" ""turned that gas valve,"" indicating a specific method (gas/exit bag).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""exit bag set up,"" ""turned that gas valve.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both.
     - Past events: The post extensively details three distinct past suicide *attempts* (aspirin overdose, gun attempt, hanging attempt). These are concrete actions that happened.
     - Current/future intentions: ""Today, I have an exit bag set up."" ""When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked."" This indicates a current, active plan and preparation, which would typically fall under 'Behavior'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains clear, detailed descriptions of multiple past suicide attempts (aspirin overdose, gun attempt, rope/hanging attempt). This aligns perfectly with the 'Attempt' definition: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. A concrete action need to have happened in the past.""
   - The post also describes current plans and preparations (""exit bag set up,"" ""turned that gas valve""), which would typically be 'Behavior'.
   - However, the 'Attempt' definition includes a crucial note: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'.""
   - Given the explicit past attempts and the presence of current plans, the rule dictates classifying it as 'Attempt'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""end my life"") and a desire to not be alive, but it does not include any specific plan, method, or details of preparation. It also does not describe a past attempt. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - Not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The definition of 'Behavior' requires ""some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken."" The phrase ""I'm about to kill myself"" expresses intent but not a specific plan.
   - Not 'Attempt' because it refers to a current/future intention, not a past action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""face death"", ""until i die or pass out"", ""if not, well, you know what happened"" (implying death). No explicit mention of ""suicide"" but clear intent to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm done"", ""I'm too pissed"", ""don't even want to feel good anymore"", ""embrace the pain"". Indicates extreme distress, anger, and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""gonna start working out until i die or pass out"". This describes a specific method (extreme physical exertion) and an intended lethal outcome.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""face death"", ""until i die or pass out"", ""if not, well, you know what happened"" strongly express a desire for death.
   - If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation': The desire to die is explicit, not vague.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""working out until i die or pass out"" is presented as a specific action with a lethal intent.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I'm now gonna start working out"" indicates an immediate intention to carry out the described action.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': The method is explicitly stated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm now gonna start working out"", ""i'll be back in 12 hours if i survived"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die (""face death"", ""until i die"").
   - It also describes a specific action/method intended to lead to death (""gonna start working out until i die or pass out""). This constitutes a plan.
   - It is not a past attempt.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation because a specific method is mentioned.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most fitting category.

I'm sorry for the question but I was hoping someone would be able to talk and help me figure it out.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I have contemplated suicide for years,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" and ""if I plan to be dead long before I retire."" These are direct mentions of suicide and death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post indicates a long-standing and certain intention to die by suicide, framed within a practical dilemma about life planning (retirement). This shows deep-seated suicidal ideation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., type of tool, substance, location) is mentioned. No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The timing is vague (""maybe in my 20's or 30's"").
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""contemplated suicide for years"" but does not describe any past *attempts* or actions taken. It refers to a future intention.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times: ""contemplated suicide,"" ""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead long before I retire.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   The post discusses the *certainty* of a future suicide but not *how* it will be carried out. The timeframe is broad and not a specific plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past contemplation (""contemplated suicide for years"") and strong *future intentions* (""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, only contemplation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because suicide is explicitly and directly mentioned.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits perfectly. The post contains ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer"" (""I know I am going to do it,"" ""plan to be dead""). However, it is ""without any specific plan to commit suicide."" There are no details on method, location, or immediate timing.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no specific plan or method mentioned. The rule states: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past suicide attempt is described. The post focuses on future intentions.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" directly asks about the lethal potential of a substance.
   - Emotional indicators: Implied distress, a desire to understand means of ending life.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""duloxetine"" (specific substance/method), ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" (preparation, acquiring means, implies future intent).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the question ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" combined with saving pills strongly implies a desire to end one's life. This moves beyond vague distress.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""duloxetine"" (a specific medication/substance).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" indicates acquiring and holding onto means for a future purpose. This is a clear sign of preparation.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is a specific method (duloxetine) and a clear preparation (saving pills). This is not uncertain.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The question is current, and ""saving for later"" indicates future intention. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is more than general distress; there's an explicit inquiry about lethality of a specific substance and a clear act of preparation (saving pills).
   - This is not 'Ideation' because it includes specific methods (""duloxetine"") and a clear sign of preparation (""saving pills for later""). The definition of 'Ideation' states: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'.""
   - This is not 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.
   - This fits the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken (e.g. lethal medication/drugs)"". The inquiry about lethality combined with saving the pills constitutes explicit suicidal thoughts and preparation with a specific method.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I just want to end"" is a direct expression of a desire to end one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""stop feeling this way,"" ""it's hell,"" ""feel so empty,"" ""out of place."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end"" is a direct expression of wanting to cease to exist.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I just want to end but haven't yet"" refers to a current desire/intention, not a past completed action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - ""Indicator"" is too low because there is an explicit desire to end one's life (""I just want to end""), which goes beyond general distress or vague feelings about death.
   - ""Behavior"" is too high because there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned.
   - ""Attempt"" is incorrect because the post explicitly states ""haven't yet,"" indicating no past concrete action.
   - ""Ideation"" fits perfectly as there is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts/feelings (""I just want to end"") without any specific plan.

It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I could be dead by the end of the day today."" It also uses the phrase ""I cant off myself,"" which is a clear euphemism for suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Living by procrastination,"" ""too tired to do the things I need to do,"" ""distracts from life pretty well."" These indicate fatigue, a struggle with life, and a desire to escape.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""go buy the gas"" in the context of ""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas."" This identifies a specific method/means being considered, even if the action is currently prevented by fatigue.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""dead by the end of the day today"" and ""off myself.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I could be dead by the end of the day today.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""buy the gas"" is mentioned as a means to ""off myself."" This indicates a specific method is being considered.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The *lack* of preparation (not leaving the house to buy gas) is mentioned, but the *idea* of the preparation (buying gas) linked to the act of suicide is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I could be dead by the end of the day today,"" ""I cant off myself if I never leave the house"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit mentions of suicide and a desire to die.
    *   **Ideation:** While there are explicit suicidal thoughts, the post goes beyond mere thoughts by mentioning a specific method (""go buy the gas"") as the means to ""off myself."" This moves it beyond simple ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I could be dead by the end of the day today,"" ""I cant off myself"") and mentions a specific method/means (""buy the gas"") that would be part of a plan to commit suicide. The phrase ""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas"" directly links the specific action (buying gas) to the suicidal act, indicating a specific method is part of the thought process, even if execution is delayed. This fits the definition of 'Behavior' which includes mentioning ""a plan to commit suicide"" or ""a specific method or preparations taken.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempts are described.

    Therefore, 'Behavior' is the most appropriate classification due to the explicit mention of a specific method/means (""gas"") in conjunction with suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""do it"" is clearly implied to be suicide given the context of ""I post about suicide constantly"" and the self-deprecating tone. ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" directly refers to acting on suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: Self-deprecating (""pussy""), frustration, impatience, and a strong desire to act on persistent suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to past *discussions* or *expressions* of suicide, not past *attempts*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I post about suicide constantly"". The phrase ""do it"" is clearly referring to suicide in this context.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" are strong expressions of a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior': There is no explicit plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrases ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" refer to current and future intentions. ""I post about suicide constantly"" refers to past behavior of discussing suicide, but the core message is about current intent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned and there's a clear desire to act on it.
   - It is not 'behavior' because no specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The post expresses a strong desire to commit suicide but lacks the ""how"".
   - It is not 'attempt' because no past suicide attempt is described. The mention of ""posting about suicide constantly"" refers to communication, not action.
   - Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit as it includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to act on them, but without a specific plan.

I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January."" It also says ""now it time to stop the lie and end it."" Most critically, it states ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" It also mentions past self-harm: ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself).""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm done and happy,"" ""big relief,"" ""unmotivated to find motivation,"" ""I'm happy at the same time,"" ""I'm not sad or depress."" These are complex and somewhat contradictory emotions, but the suicidal intent is clear despite the stated happiness/lack of sadness.

    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions a past *plan* (""planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't"") which was *not* carried out.

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past self-harm and a past *unsuccessful* plan (""But I didn't""). Crucially, it refers to *current* plans and preparations: ""So I plan to hang myself..."" and ""Everything is ready.""
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? A past *plan* was described but explicitly stated as *not* carried out. Past self-harm was described, but not as a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""hang myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts by detailing a specific plan (""hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"") and explicitly stating that preparations are complete (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""). This aligns perfectly with the 'behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide... It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preparations taken.""
    *   While past self-harm is mentioned, it's not described as a suicide *attempt*. The past plan in January was explicitly stated as *not* carried out. Therefore, 'attempt' is not the primary classification, as the most severe element is the current, prepared plan.

Based on the explicit suicidal ideation, detailed plan, and stated preparations, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""going to die anyway"", ""don't really want to die"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""What's the point of living"", ""dumbest shit ever"", ""I wish I was never born"", ""no point for us being here"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, and nihilism.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is not present.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I wish I was never born"" suggests a desire for non-existence, but this is immediately contradicted by ""at the same time don't really want to die"". The post questions the *point* of living and dying, rather than expressing a direct desire to end life. According to the 'Ideation' definition, it requires ""a desire to not be alive any longer"". The explicit statement ""don't really want to die"" means this criterion is not met. The 'Indicator' definition states: ""The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings... Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" This post fits the description of general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without a direct suicidal wish.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current philosophical thoughts and feelings about life's meaning, not past events or future intentions of action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses profound existential despair and a questioning of the meaning of life and death.
   - Crucially, it explicitly states ""don't really want to die,"" which means it does not meet the ""desire to not be alive any longer"" criterion for 'Ideation'.
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or any plan/method.
   - Therefore, it falls under 'Indicator' as it expresses general distress, sadness, and hopelessness without a direct suicidal intent or mention.

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Key elements:** The user expresses extreme shame and embarrassment over a past action (buying a used pocket pussy) that has become public knowledge. They are concerned about starting a new school and how this information will affect their reputation. They feel ""disgusting"" and ""messed up big time."" They explicitly ask for help and for people not to comment negatively.
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** None.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I really need help,"" ""very ashamed,"" ""fucked up,"" ""afraid,"" ""disgusting."" These indicate significant distress, shame, anxiety, and a feeling of being ostracized.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The user expresses a desire for help and concern about social perception, not a desire to end their life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The core event (buying the item) is past. The shame, fear, and need for help are current, related to future social interactions at a new school. There is no mention of past or current suicidal intent or actions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys distress, shame, and a plea for help. However, it completely lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts or plans. According to the definitions, 'Indicator' is for posts that ""lack any explicit expression concerning suicide"" but may have ""general expressions of distress or sadness."" This post fits this definition perfectly. There is no ""desire to not be alive any longer"" (Ideation), no ""plan to commit suicide"" (Behavior), and no description of ""past attempts"" (Attempt).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""they dont let you kill yourself""
   - Emotional indicators: ""sick of it"", ""suffer"", ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"" (despair, frustration, feeling trapped)
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill yourself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""sick of it"", implying a desire to end it, and directly stating ""dont let you kill yourself"".
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""they dont let you kill yourself""), not past events.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and expresses a desire to end suffering/life (""sick of it""), which falls under explicit suicidal thoughts. However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. It does not describe a past attempt. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""pls fucking end me before the day. pls"" is a direct plea to die. ""till i say im going to do it"" implies ""it"" refers to suicide, given the context of people caring only then.
   - Emotional indicators: ""lonely,"" ""nobody fucking cares,"" ""Nobody cares ever,"" ""Im such a spoiled piece of shit"" indicate strong feelings of loneliness, neglect, low self-worth, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""pls fucking end me"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. The phrase ""im going to do it"" in the context of people caring only then, strongly implies suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""pls fucking end me before the day. pls"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - The post expresses a desire to die but lacks any specific details about *how* or *where* this would happen.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and a desire for a future outcome (""before the day""). It does not describe past events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit expressions of wanting to die (""pls fucking end me"").
   - **Ideation:** The post clearly expresses a desire to die and suicidal thoughts (""pls fucking end me""). However, it does not include any specific plan, method, or preparation. This perfectly fits the definition of Ideation: ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide.""
   - **Behavior:** Ruled out because no specific plan (method, tools, location) or preparations are mentioned. The general phrase ""im going to do it"" is not a specific plan.
   - **Attempt:** Ruled out because it describes current feelings and desires, not a past suicidal action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a desire for death (""I hope it'll be me next"" in the context of stabbings).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses a desire to die as a way to avoid ""shame"" associated with suicide, indicating distress and a desire to escape.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method of death (""stabbing"") is mentioned as a desired outcome. However, this is a passive desire to be a *victim* of an external event, not an active plan to *commit* suicide by the user. There are no signs of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""with a suicide"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I hope it'll be me next"" (referring to a fatal stabbing).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""stabbings"" as the desired method of death.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.
    *   **If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.** The user expresses a desire for a specific *way* to die (being stabbed), but this is a passive wish for an external event, not an active *plan to commit suicide* by the user. The user is not planning to stab themselves or take any active steps to initiate their death. The phrasing ""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing"" implies a desire to avoid the act of *committing* suicide themselves while still achieving the outcome of death. This aligns with a strong desire to die and specific ideation about *how* death might occur, but without an active plan for self-harm or suicide initiation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This refers to current/future intentions (""I hope it'll be me next"").
    *   No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next,"" ""with a suicide"").
    *   While a specific *method* of death (being stabbed) is mentioned, it's a passive desire for an external event, not an active *plan to commit suicide* initiated by the user. The user is not outlining steps they will take to end their life.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide."" The desire to die is clear, but a concrete, self-initiated plan to commit suicide is absent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" multiple times and ""put an end to it all.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money"" clearly indicates severe despair, hopelessness, and social isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user asks ""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"" and ""how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it?"". While there's a desire for a *scenario* (disappearing, new identity) to facilitate suicide, there is *no specific method* (e.g., ""I will use a gun,"" ""I will jump off a bridge,"" ""I have pills"") mentioned for the act of suicide itself. The question is about *how to disappear to then kill oneself*, not *how to kill oneself*.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""i want to put an end to it all"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post discusses a desire to disappear and obtain a new identity *before* committing suicide, but it does not specify *how* the suicide would be committed (e.g., type of weapon, specific location for jumping, specific substance). The phrasing ""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"" is a general question about achieving the outcome, not a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations for the *act* of suicide are mentioned, only a desire to disappear first.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""i want to put an end to it all"", ""how can i just disappear? ... so i can just kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all""), which rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post *does not* include any specific plan, method, or means for committing suicide. It describes a desired *pre-condition* (disappearing, new identity) but not the actual *method* of suicide. According to the definition, 'behavior' requires ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods)."" Since these are absent, and the rule states ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior',"" 'ideation' is the correct choice.
    *   The post does not describe any past suicide attempts, ruling out 'attempt'.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, for the past event (""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag""). For current/future intentions, ""try again tonight"" implies a method, and ""another plan in mind"" indicates future planning.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The past action involved specific means. The intention to ""try again tonight"" and having ""another plan in mind"" indicate ongoing suicidal intent and potential preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. ""I tried to kill myself last night"" refers to a past event. ""I'm gonna try again tonight"" and ""I have another plan in mind"" refer to current/future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a detailed description of the attempt last night.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag."" This perfectly matches the definition of ""Attempt"": ""The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past.""
    *   Furthermore, the ""Attempt"" definition also states: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" This post describes a past attempt and also mentions current plans (""I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind."").
    *   Therefore, ""Attempt"" is the most appropriate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The user mentions feeling ""tired,"" ""empty,"" and ""worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode."" They also state ""Just don't want to get out of bed"" and ""I just want to sleep 24/7."" These are signs of distress and potential depression, but not direct mentions of suicide or self-harm.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): Fatigue, emptiness, worry about depression, lack of motivation (""don't want to get out of bed""). While there's a contrast with positive life aspects, the core emotional state described is one of exhaustion and emptiness.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The desire to ""sleep 24/7"" is an expression of extreme fatigue and a wish to escape current feelings, but not a direct statement of wanting to die or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post expresses general distress, fatigue, and concerns about a depressive episode. There is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal thoughts. There are no plans, methods, or past attempts described. According to the definitions, ""Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned.""
