0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""ending my life again"", ""go to a bridge and jump off"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Never will find love"", ""mental breakdown"", ""everything in my life is crap even me"", ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself"". These indicate hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and severe emotional distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""go to a bridge and jump off"" identifies a specific method (jumping) and a location (a bridge). This indicates a concrete plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""ending my life again"" implies a past consideration or tendency towards ending life, though not explicitly stating a past *attempt* that was acted upon. It suggests a recurring pattern of suicidal thoughts/tendencies.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""ending my life"" and ""jump off"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""go to a bridge and jump off"" clearly states a method (jumping) and a location (bridge).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The explicit mention of a method and location (""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"") indicates a strong tendency and a formulated plan, which goes beyond mere ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""Kind of thinking about ending my life again"" refers to a current consideration with a past history of such thoughts. ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" refers to a current and future intention/desire to act.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** ""ending my life again"" suggests a past *tendency* or *consideration*, but not an explicit past *attempt* that was acted upon.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** Not applicable. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post moves beyond mere ideation by providing a specific plan/method (""go to a bridge and jump off"") and a strong tendency to act (""I want to go..."").
    *   **behavior:** This category fits well. The post has explicit suicidal expression. There is a clear ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" (""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" with a specific method/location). Additionally, ""ending my life again"" suggests a ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" in the sense of recurring suicidal ideation/tendencies, even if not a past *attempt*.
    *   **attempt:** Not applicable. The post does not describe a recent suicide attempt, nor does ""ending my life again"" explicitly state a past *attempt* that was acted upon; it refers to thinking about it again.

The presence of a specific method and location (""go to a bridge and jump off"") and the expressed desire (""I want to go..."") strongly points to a ""plan or tendency to act out,"" which is the defining characteristic of the 'behavior' category over 'ideation'.

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going to die soon,"" especially when paired with ""inconsolable,"" strongly implies a desire for death or a belief in imminent self-inflicted death, which constitutes explicit suicidal expression.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention (""I'm going to die soon"").

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I hate living"" expresses a strong desire not to be alive, which is a form of suicidal ideation, though not explicitly using the word ""suicide"" or ""die.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""hate living"", ""fuck"" - indicate strong negative emotions, despair, and existential distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I hate living"" and ""why i have to live until now"" are direct expressions of not wanting to be alive, which is a form of suicidal ideation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and thoughts (""I hate living"", ""sometime i think about""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': This category is for no explicit suicidal expression or resolved issues. The post *does* contain strong expressions of not wanting to live, which goes beyond a mere indicator.
   - 'ideation': This category is for ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" The phrases ""I hate living"" and ""why i have to live until now"" are explicit expressions of a desire not to be alive, fitting the ""explicit suicidal expression"" criteria in the context of the given categories. There is no plan or tendency to act out mentioned. This aligns well.
   - 'behavior': This requires a plan/tendency to act or historical self-harm behavior. Neither is present.
   - 'attempt': This requires mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. No attempt is mentioned.
   Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit as it captures the explicit expression of not wanting to live without any associated plan or action.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Help me kill myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: A clear plea for assistance in ending one's life, indicating severe distress and suicidal intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal"" explicitly mentions a specific method (barbiturates/Nembutal) and indicates a search or desire to acquire the means, which is a form of preparation or tendency to act.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Help me kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Help me kill myself.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""barbiturates/Nembutal.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the request to ""help me find some trustworthy"" means indicates an active step towards acquiring the method, which is a clear sign of a plan or tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current and future intentions (""Help me kill myself"" is a present request for a future action).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Help me kill myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because it not only expresses a desire to die but also specifies a method (""barbiturates/Nembutal"") and actively seeks help in acquiring the means (""help me find""), which constitutes a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so it does not fit 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal expression combined with a specific method and an active step towards acquiring means (a plan/tendency to act) places it firmly in the 'behavior' category.

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""painless way to die"", ""want to sleep forever"", ""how to die with certainty and without pain"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""struggling"", ""unmotivated"", ""feel so sorry for them"", ""selfish"", ""can't get off my lazy ass"", ""The world scares me"", ""fear intimacy"", ""feel worthless"", ""tired"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is *asking* about a ""painless way to die"" and ""how to die with certainty and without pain,"" indicating a search for a method rather than possession or preparation of one. No specific method is identified.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It discusses past reasons for suicidal thoughts that are now ""solved,"" but the core of the post expresses a *current* feeling of pointlessness leading to a *current* desire to die (""I still want to die,"" ""I still have this feeling that I should do it anyways""). It also refers to past *ideation* (""for a year straight I was constantly thinking"").

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it."" These are direct expressions of wanting to die. ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" indicates extreme distress and a potential desire for physical manifestation of pain, which could be interpreted as a precursor to self-harm, but not a direct plan for suicide.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""so much mental pain,"" ""can't handle it,"" ""hate everything,"" ""need peace."" These indicate hopelessness, despair, and an inability to cope.
    *   Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it."" These clearly express a desire for death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention (""tonight"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear explicit suicidal expression (""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan (e.g., method, means, location) or concrete steps towards acting out self-harm or suicide. The phrase ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" expresses a desire for a different form of pain, but not a specific *plan* or *tendency to act out* self-harm or suicide as defined for the 'behavior' category. The urgency (""tonight"") indicates a strong desire but still lacks the 'how'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits 'ideation' because it has explicit suicidal expression but lacks a concrete plan or clear tendency to commit suicide.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself"" is present.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""tiring"", ""tired"", ""lonely"", ""ugly and stupid and not good enough"" (negative self-perception), ""mind is against you"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.
    *   Crucial nuance: The user explicitly states, ""but I don't actually want to.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The brain is telling the user to kill themselves, but the user explicitly states they *do not want to*. This negates the desire or intention.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current, ongoing intrusive thoughts and feelings (""keeps telling me"", ""I don't actually want to"", ""It's so tiring"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself""). This means it doesn't fit the ""no explicit suicidal expression"" part of 'indicator'.
    *   However, the user immediately qualifies this by saying ""but I don't actually want to."" This is a critical statement that explicitly negates any desire or intention to act on the suicidal thought.
    *   Let's evaluate 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" While there is explicit suicidal expression and no plan, the explicit statement ""I don't actually want to"" directly contradicts the idea of a ""tendency to commit suicide."" A tendency implies an inclination or leaning, which the user denies.
    *   Let's evaluate 'indicator': ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression *or* has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" Although the first part doesn't apply, the second part, ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues,"" is relevant. The user is expressing that the *issue* of *wanting* to commit suicide is resolved or absent, even though the intrusive thought is present. The desire to act is not there. This indicates a lower level of immediate risk related to active suicidal intent. The user is struggling with intrusive thoughts, not an active suicidal desire.

Based on the explicit negation of wanting to commit suicide, despite the presence of the thought, the post aligns best with the 'indicator' category, specifically the aspect of ""resolved suicidal issues"" regarding the *desire* or *intent* to act.

   - Are there signs of preparation? The post doesn't describe active preparation, but the contemplation of specific methods (""either I run towards... or find..."") indicates a strong tendency or consideration of acting.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions. ""I want to die now, right now in this instant"", ""either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids."" The mention of 5-6 years refers to a prolonged state of distress, not a past attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by explicitly mentioning specific methods (""run towards a cop with a knife"", ""find a dealer with some opioids"") and a strong desire for immediate action (""want to die now, right now in this instant""). This indicates a clear ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - There is no mention of a *recent* or *historical* suicide *attempt*, only the consideration of future actions.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression, the mention of specific methods, and the strong desire for immediate action, the post falls under the 'behavior' category.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm**: No explicit mentions of these terms.
    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""fucked up way to feel"", ""no one sticks around"", ""everyone leaves you eventually"", ""it starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts."" -> indicates feelings of loneliness, abandonment, self-blame, emotional pain, and a sense of resignation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts**: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is present. This is a strong expression of self-rejection and a desire to escape one's own being or painful circumstances, but it is metaphorical and does not directly state a desire to die or not be alive in a literal suicidal sense. It's more about escaping one's identity or current emotional state rather than ending one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes an ongoing pattern of thinking and feeling (""I always think"", ""I push people away unintentionally""). There are no references to past suicide attempts or specific future suicidal intentions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post expresses significant emotional distress, self-blame, and a deep sense of loneliness and abandonment. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" conveys a strong desire to escape one's own painful existence or identity. However, it does not contain explicit suicidal language (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I wish I were dead""). The emotional content is severe, but it falls short of the ""explicit suicidal expression"" required for 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt' categories. Therefore, it best fits the 'indicator' category, as it lacks explicit suicidal expression.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i plan to kill myself at 21""
   - Emotional indicators: ""not ok,"" ""severely codependent,"" ""can't think for myself,"" ""no sense of self,"" ""constant anxiety, self doubt, and mistrust,"" ""feel really small,"" ""very unhealthy,"" ""no hope,"" ""braindead,"" ""loneliness,"" ""anhedonic and dissoative,"" ""this is hell.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i plan to kill myself at 21"" (a specific future date for the action, indicating a plan). No specific method (e.g., tool, location) is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i plan to kill myself at 21.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the explicit plan to kill oneself serves as this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No specific signs of preparation are mentioned.
   - However, a definite future *plan* (""i plan to kill myself at 21"") is explicitly stated. This constitutes a ""plan"" as per the category definitions.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current distress and a concrete future intention/plan (""i plan to kill myself at 21, whether i want to or not, i'm 18 now"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""i plan to kill myself at 21""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post *also* contains a specific future plan (""i plan to kill myself at 21""). The definition of 'ideation' states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" Since a plan is present, 'ideation' is not the best fit.
   - The 'behavior' category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" This post clearly has explicit suicidal expression and a stated *plan* to commit suicide, even if it's future-dated. The presence of a plan, regardless of its immediacy or detailed method, moves it beyond mere ideation.
   - The post does not mention any recent or historical suicide *attempts*, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification due to the explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear, albeit future-dated, plan.

Current feelings and future intentions (""I want to die"", ""I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case""). The ""5 more years"" indicates a postponement of any potential action.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions. The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" expresses extreme dependency and fear of a future without it, but not a direct suicidal statement.
   - Emotional indicators: ""very worried"", ""fucking horrified"", ""keep crying"", ""having panic attacks"", ""too much"", ""going insane"", ""fucking scared"". These indicate severe distress, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The statement ""I can't live without estrogen"" is a statement of perceived necessity for a specific condition, not a general desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current extreme distress and future fears related to health and social acceptance.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses extreme emotional distress, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed (""its just too much. I'm going insane"").
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or self-harm. The language used, while indicative of severe psychological distress, does not cross the threshold into explicit suicidal ideation or behavior.
   - There are no plans, methods, or preparations for suicide or self-harm.
   - There are no mentions of past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.
   - Based on the definitions:
     - 'attempt' requires explicit expression of recent or historical suicide attempts. Not present.
     - 'behavior' requires explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan/tendency to act out, or historical self-harm behavior. Explicit suicidal expression is missing.
     - 'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression. This is missing.
     - 'indicator' states ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression"". This matches the analysis. The post shows significant distress and potential risk factors, but not explicit suicidal intent.

22,There is NO hope left. I've been on medication after medication. I've done biofeedback. I went to therapy twice a week for 4 years. I did EMDR. I had 27 sessions of TMS that did NOTHING. There is no way I can afford Ketamine. I live on $786 a month and some days don't even eat. So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more. Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""There is NO hope left."", ""Now it's time to end it."" (direct expression of wanting to die).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""NO hope left"", ""don't even eat"" (suggests severe despair, hopelessness, financial distress).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method or plan is mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" This phrasing, especially in context with ""Now it's time to end it,"" strongly indicates multiple past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""Now it's time to end it"" is a direct and explicit expression of suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Now it's time to end it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both:
        *   Past events: ""I've been on medication..."", ""I went to therapy..."", ""I did EMDR..."", ""I had 27 sessions of TMS..."", and critically, ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" (past actions to end life).
        *   Current/future intentions: ""There is NO hope left."", ""Now it's time to end it."" (current state and future intent).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more."" explicitly describes multiple past attempts to end life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression (""end it"") and mentions of past attempts.
    *   'ideation': Incorrect, as there is more than just ideation; past attempts are clearly implied, and a current intent to act is present.
    *   'behavior': This category includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While the past actions could be seen as self-harm, the context of ""end it"" points more strongly to *suicide attempts*.
    *   'attempt': This category includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The repeated phrase ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more,"" directly preceding ""Now it's time to end it,"" is a clear and explicit reference to multiple past suicide attempts. The current statement ""Now it's time to end it"" also indicates a present intent to act, likely another attempt. Therefore, 'attempt' is the most fitting category.

   - Emotional indicators: ""Society doesn't like me,"" ""People bully me,"" ""don't feel comfortable,"" ""something is wrong with me,"" ""nothing fills the hole in my heart,"" ""feel lonely,"" ""feel like I am only watching other living human beings,"" ""feel like I am on the moon,"" ""very unconnected with this world,"" ""feel like a creature."" These indicate profound despair, isolation, and a sense of not belonging.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned. The phrase ""Everyday I am trying to survive"" indicates an ongoing struggle, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the constant thought of suicide implies a desire to escape life, although not phrased as ""I want to die."" The explicit mention of ""thinking about suicide"" is sufficient.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"" refers to current and ongoing thoughts. ""Everyday I am trying to survive"" refers to current struggle.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - There is no mention of a past suicide attempt or self-harm behavior.
   - This fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""What's the use"", ""given up in life"", ""for me it doesn't"" [get better]), despair, feeling like a burden (""only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" This clearly indicates preparation and a timeline. No specific method is detailed, but the existence of a plan, note, and date is significant.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""not scared to die"" and ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April"" strongly imply a desire to end life. ""Given up in life"" also indicates a lack of will to live.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method (e.g., tool, substance) is mentioned.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" This indicates significant preparation and a timeline.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes past struggles (""dropped out"", ""cut friends off"") and current feelings (""given up"", ""drinking and smoking""). Crucially, ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April"" refers to a clear future intention.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""not scared to die"", ""plan, note and date"").
    *   There is a clear ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" indicated by ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" This goes beyond mere ideation.
    *   It does not describe a *recent* or *historical* suicide attempt, which would classify it as 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the category 'behavior' best fits, as it includes explicit suicidal expression and a plan/tendency to act.

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care.

Past self-harm is indicated by ""cuts I have all over myself"".
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No past suicide attempts are described. Past self-harm is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*, which rules out 'attempt'.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? The user notes the distance and feasibility (""its around 4-5km, its possible to get there""), indicating consideration, but explicitly states ""i just can't commit to it."" This suggests knowledge of a potential method/location but a current lack of intent or ability to act on it. The phrase ""i can't kill myself"" reinforces this.

   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current overwhelming feelings and a desire for the current state to end. ""I wish I was never born"" refers to a hypothetical past but reflects current despair. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains strong expressions of wanting an end to life/existence (""I just want it all to stop,"" ""I wish I was never born"") due to overwhelming despair, which constitutes explicit suicidal expression.

   - Emotional indicators: ""Depressed"", ""shit show"", ""fake ass friends and shitty family""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., tool, location) is mentioned. However, the phrase ""have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, ""all ready tried that before"" refers to trying to communicate, not a past suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""end it all"", ""goodbye everybody"").
   - It clearly indicates a plan (""I already know how I'm gonna do it"") and a tendency/readiness to act (""I'm ready"", ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks"").
   - This aligns directly with the definition of 'behavior': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - It does not describe a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not suitable.

    *   It is not 'attempt' because the post explicitly states ""can't fucking do it,"" meaning the act itself was not carried out, distinguishing it from a completed or executed attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?""
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed 16 year old,"" ""stripping yourself of individuality,"" ""people love plastic people"" (suggests despair, feeling unaccepted, hopelessness).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""how about i die then"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""how about i die then"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention in the form of a rhetorical question (""how about i die then"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""how about i die then"") but lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or past attempts. This aligns directly with the definition of 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""killing myself will happen"", ""taking my own life"", ""will not live to see my 40th birthday"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""no hope"", ""All is lost"", ""pointless, meaningless, and a waste of energy"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""It is my daily reminder that killing myself will happen."" (suggests mental reinforcement/preparation). ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life."" (strong conviction). ""When it will happen I am unsure, but I do know that I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)."" (sets a timeline/deadline). No specific method or tool is mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""At least I DID try"" refers to trying to live/cope, not a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""killing myself"", ""taking my own life"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life"", ""will not live to see my 40th birthday"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The ""daily reminder"" on the wallpaper and the ""100% confirmed"" statement, along with the set deadline (""not live to see my 40th birthday""), indicate a strong intention and a general plan regarding commitment and timeline, even without a specific method. This signifies a strong tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""will happen"", ""will be taking"", ""will not live"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
Based on the analysis:
- The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
- The post goes beyond mere ideation by stating it's ""100% confirmed"" and setting a deadline (""will not live to see my 40th birthday""). This indicates a strong ""tendency to act out"" and a general ""plan"" (commitment and timeline), even if a specific method is absent. This aligns with the 'behavior' category definition: ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
- There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
- The strong conviction and timeline differentiate it from 'ideation', which specifies ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"".

Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm**: ""kill myself"" is mentioned twice.
    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""so so tired"", ""tired of being criticized and unloved"", ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"", ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here."" These indicate profound exhaustion, despair, regret, and a strong desire for death.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: No specific current plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The ""perfect opportunity"" refers to a past situation, not a current one.
    *   **References to past attempts**: The post states, ""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy . I shouldn't have talked myself down ."" This describes a *past opportunity* to commit suicide that was *not* acted upon, and is now regretted. It is not a description of a past *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"", ""The worse decision I ever made was staying here.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent. The ""perfect opportunity"" was in the past and vague.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past *missed opportunity* to commit suicide (""6 month ago"") and expresses a strong *current desire* to have acted on it and to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, it describes a past *opportunity not taken*, explicitly stating the person ""talked myself down"" and ""was a pussy,"" meaning they did *not* attempt suicide at that time.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   **indicator**: Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation**: The post has explicit suicidal expression (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"") and a desire to die, but it does *not* describe a current plan or tendency to act out. The mention of a past *missed opportunity* is not a past *attempt* or *self-harm behavior*. This category fits best.
    *   **behavior**: Not applicable. There is no current plan or tendency to act out self-harm/suicide. The historical context is a *missed opportunity*, not a ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" or an *attempt*.
    *   **attempt**: Not applicable. The post explicitly states the past opportunity was *not* acted upon (""I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down"").

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses a current desire to die and regret over a past missed opportunity for suicide, but no current plan or tendency to act.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>

35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working"" is explicitly stated as metaphorical. However, ""I just want to not exist"" is a strong expression of a desire for non-existence, which is a form of explicit suicidal expression. ""God I fucking hate myself"" indicates severe self-loathing.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hollow,"" ""sadness,"" ""nothing but sadness,"" ""hurts so bad,"" ""hate this,"" ""crying,"" ""suffer,"" ""painful middle ground,"" ""hate myself."" These all point to profound despair, hopelessness, and self-hatred.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not directly as ""suicide"" or ""killing myself"" in a literal sense.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to not exist"" is a direct and explicit expression of not wanting to be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The core expression ""I just want to not exist"" refers to a current desire/intention. The feelings described are current, though the context of birthdays and past experiences spans years.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I just want to not exist"") but does not include any mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act on these feelings. It also does not mention any past self-harm behavior or suicide attempts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""too scared"", ""don't want to die in pain"", ""don't want to make my mother sad"", ""can't keep doing this it's too much"", ""too painful"", ""loathe myself"", ""sad"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, self-loathing, and a desire to end suffering.

    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past *attempts*. ""i'm on suicide watch"" implies a past assessment of risk or concern, which could be related to past behaviors or strong ideation, but not necessarily an attempt. ""ive been just getting by for almost twenty years"" refers to a long period of struggle.

    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** ""while everyones asleep"" indicates a temporal aspect of a potential plan, but no active acquisition of means is mentioned. However, the articulation of a specific method is present.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""i could take a bunch of pills"" refers to a current consideration of a future action. ""i'm on suicide watch"" refers to a current state resulting from past concerns/behaviors. The general despair (""can't keep doing this"", ""too painful"") refers to current feelings.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""wish i could just fucking end it"", ""better if i was dead""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method: ""take a bunch of pills"". This constitutes a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" even if the poster expresses fear or reluctance. The presence of a concrete method is key.
    *   The phrase ""i'm on suicide watch"" also suggests a historical experience of self-harm *behavior* or strong suicidal tendencies that led to being monitored, which fits the 'behavior' category definition (""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"").
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical *suicide attempt*, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The author states ""I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life,"" ""haven't had suicidal ideation in months,"" and ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" They also mention ""how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators: The author mentions their past struggles with ""stress, anxiety, and depression"" due to Crohn's Disease. They state they are ""in a good place now.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: For the author's past attempt, they mention ""I faltered in my plan,"" implying a plan existed, but no specific method is detailed. There are no current plans or preparations mentioned for the author.
   - References to past attempts: The author explicitly states: ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" and ""how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets).""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, by the author regarding their own past (""suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" ""attempt,"" ""commit suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not for the author's current state. The author explicitly states they are ""in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the author's current state. For the author's past attempt, a plan was implied but no specific method was detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for the author's current state.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The author's suicidal experiences are described as past (""on-and-off for much of my life,"" ""in 2009,"" ""haven't had suicidal ideation in months""). Their current state is explicitly stated as resolved.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the author describes their own ""very serious attempt in 2009.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" Therefore, the information about the friend's suicidal intentions is irrelevant for classification.
   - The author's current state is ""in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months,"" which aligns with ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues"" under the 'indicator' category.
   - However, the 'attempt' category definition includes: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, *or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*.""
   - The author explicitly mentions a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" (""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded"").
   - Since the post contains explicit mention of the author's past suicide attempt, it falls into the 'attempt' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""lol kermit sewer slide"" is a known euphemism for suicide or self-harm. The user states these thoughts occur frequently (""Even on days where I'm actually happy I still get the... thoughts"") and that ""it's tempting a lot of the time.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared,"" ""worry,"" ""tired of always being afraid and upset,"" ""tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation,"" ""shame."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the euphemism ""kermit sewer slide"" which directly refers to suicide/self-harm.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not a direct statement like ""I want to die,"" but the recurring ""sewer slide"" thoughts and the strong feeling of temptation imply a desire for an end to suffering, which is a form of suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and ongoing thoughts and feelings (""I still get the... thoughts,"" ""it's tempting a lot of the time"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kermit sewer slide"" thoughts). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a past or recent suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on ""plan or tendency to commit suicide/act out self-harm."" While there's no *plan*, the phrase ""it's tempting a lot of the time"" strongly indicates a *tendency to act out* or a strong pull towards acting on the suicidal thoughts. This goes beyond mere ideation (having the thought) and suggests a significant risk of progression towards action, even without a concrete plan yet. The thoughts are not just present, they are *tempting*. This aligns more closely with the ""tendency to act out"" component of the 'behavior' category.

And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it?

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I hate being alive"", ""shouldn't exist"", ""want to kill myself"" (repeated), ""people who want to die"", ""I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train"", ""if I did kill myself"", ""push me to go thru with it"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hate myself so much"", ""terrible"", ""awful"", ""disgusting and pathetic"", ""sad and stupid"", ""wish I was never born"", ""hate everything"", ""humiliates me so deeply"", ""so fucked in the head"", ""want to crawl out of my skin"", ""coward"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""jump in front of a train"" (specific method). ""don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)"" indicates thinking about practicalities related to dying, suggesting preparation is being considered, even if it's a barrier. The phrase ""It's looking pretty good"" suggests the plan is being seriously considered. The request ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"" indicates a desire to act on the plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""want to kill myself"", ""kill myself"", ""if I did kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I hate being alive"", ""shouldn't exist"", ""wish I was never born"", ""people who want to die"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump in front of a train"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the consideration of ""end of life stuff"" (belongings, phone) indicates thinking through the practicalities of a suicide, which is a form of preparation or planning. The phrase ""It's looking pretty good"" implies the plan is being seriously considered.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The post expresses a strong current desire (""I want to kill myself so badly"") and contemplates a future action (""I wish I had the guts to jump..."", ""if I did kill myself"", ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""want to kill myself""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and showing a strong *tendency to act out* (""It's looking pretty good"", ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"") and consideration of practicalities related to the act (""end of life stuff""). This aligns with the 'behavior' category which states ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category due to the explicit suicidal expression, the mention of a specific method/plan, and the clear tendency/desire to act on it.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>

No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains phrases like ""in my grave I lay,"" ""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35,"" and ""that is my outer limit."" The desire to be ""the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds"" also strongly implies a wish for non-existence.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Pointlessness,"" ""sick of everybody's fascination,"" ""sick of appearances,"" ""distresses me"" (regarding heaven), ""pain caused to people I care about."" These indicate feelings of hopelessness, despair, nihilism, and profound weariness with life and social interaction.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The statement ""I know I will die by 35"" is presented as a fatalistic prediction rather than a concrete plan of action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35,"" ""in my grave I lay,"" and the desire to be a ""missing pixel"" or ""missing puzzle piece"" are direct expressions of wanting to cease to exist or die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post expresses current feelings (""I am sick of,"" ""I want to disappear"") and a future prediction/intention (""I know I will die by 35"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly contains explicit expressions of wanting to die/disappear/not exist (""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35,"" ""in my grave I lay""). This rules out 'indicator' as it's not resolved and has explicit suicidal expression.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or active preparation to act on these feelings. The statement about dying by 35 is a fatalistic prediction, not a described plan of action for *causing* that death. There is also no historical experience of self-harm or suicide attempts mentioned. This absence of a plan or tendency to act out, and lack of historical behavior/attempts, rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'ideation' category: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill yourself"", ""hanging myself"", ""trying to die"").

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (like acquiring means), but the detailed discussion of *how* to die and the *efficacy* of specific methods suggests a strong ""tendency to act out"" or a practical consideration of methods. The user is actively pondering the mechanics of suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""idk if hanging myself would even work"", ""idk if taking these pills would work"", ""I'm trying to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post goes beyond mere ideation by discussing specific methods (""hanging myself"", ""taking these pills"") and evaluating their potential success or failure. This detailed consideration of *how* to commit suicide suggests more than just an abstract thought.
    *   **behavior:** This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The post clearly has explicit suicidal expression. The discussion of specific methods and their potential effectiveness (""idk if hanging myself would even work"", ""idk if taking these pills would work"", ""I'm trying to die not end up brain damaged"") indicates a ""tendency to act out"" or a practical consideration of *how* to commit suicide, even if the user expresses uncertainty about the methods' efficacy or finality. The user is actively seeking a viable method.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    The detailed consideration of specific methods and their viability, combined with the explicit statement ""I'm trying to die,"" fits the ""tendency to act out"" aspect of the 'behavior' category.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Everything is so much effort"", ""I want to die"", ""so fucking depressed and numb and sick of everything"", ""can't even think straight anymore"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   However, the statement ""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up"" indicates a *tendency* or consideration of acting, with the fear of failure being the primary deterrent. The contemplation of admitting oneself to a psych ward also suggests a recognition of severe risk and a potential behavioral response to it.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and future considerations (""thinking about admitting myself?"", ""I want to die"", ""I'm probably not gonna do anything"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die"", ""killing myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   While there is no specific plan, the phrase ""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up"" strongly implies a *tendency* to act, where the only thing preventing the action is the fear of failure. This goes beyond simple 'ideation' (which states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"").
    *   The active consideration of ""admitting myself?"" to a ""psych ward"" also represents a behavioral response to the severe suicidal ideation and distress, indicating a recognition of risk and a potential step towards safety. This aligns with the 'behavior' category which includes ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the combination of explicit suicidal expression and the implied tendency to act (even if inhibited by fear) and the consideration of seeking inpatient care best fits the 'behavior' category.

   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""every night i count my pills"" is a recurring, ritualistic preparation and indicates having the means readily available.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to ongoing, current behavior (""every night"", ""every day"") and current/future intentions (""wonder why i didnt take them all""). It's a continuous contemplation and preparation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the post states ""why i didnt take them all"", indicating an attempt did not occur.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression and a clear method/preparation.
   - 'ideation': While there is explicit suicidal expression, there is also a specific method (""pills"") and a clear tendency/preparation (""every night i count my pills""). This goes beyond mere thoughts.
   - 'behavior': This category states ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The post has explicit suicidal expression (implied desire to die by overdose), a clear method (pills), and a strong tendency/preparation (""every night i count my pills""). This fits perfectly.
   - 'attempt': Not applicable, as the post explicitly states the action was *not* taken (""why i didnt take them all"").

51,The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately. Idk why but in the past few months my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral. Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me. I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again. I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: ""unbearably strong thoughts,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle,"" ""honestly don't know what to do at this rate."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and difficulty coping.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No direct reference to past *suicide* attempts. There is a reference to ""don't want to end up in the psych ward again,"" which indicates past mental health hospitalization, but not necessarily a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post describes a struggle to live (""making it through the day is such a struggle""), but not an explicit desire to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""lately,"" ""in the past few months,"" ""Everyday waking up"" indicate current and ongoing struggle. The reference to the ""psych ward again"" refers to a past experience.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past hospitalization for mental health reasons.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses severe emotional distress, a ""downward spiral"" of thoughts, and a struggle to cope with daily life. It also mentions past mental health hospitalization. However, it *lacks explicit suicidal expression* (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself""). It describes a general state of suffering and a fear of re-hospitalization, which are strong *indicators* of mental health crisis and potential future risk, but do not meet the criteria for 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt' which all require explicit suicidal expression.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly states ""killing myself"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""mentally ill"", ""can't afford treatment"", ""can't hold work"", ""health is shit"", ""what's the fucking point in any of this"", ""fed up of all this bullshit"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, despair, and frustration.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a future intention/prediction (""i know that i'm going to end up... killing myself"") based on current overwhelming circumstances and a present lack of reason not to (""what's the point in not"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing myself"", ""what's the point in not""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, nor any signs of preparation.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on ""plan or tendency to commit suicide"". While there is no *plan*, the phrase ""i know that i'm going to end up... killing myself because what's the point in not"" strongly indicates a *tendency* or current inclination towards suicide. The ""what's the point in not"" suggests a lack of perceived alternative or reason to live, implying a leaning towards the action rather than just a fleeting thought. This goes beyond mere ideation and suggests a strong current inclination or perceived inevitability.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrases ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" and ""I cant live anymore"" strongly imply a desire to end life. ""Do this"" refers to ending the suffering, likely through suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I absolutely cannot fight anymore,"" ""non stop pain and suffering,"" ""Please,"" ""I cant"" (repeated) indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, and a plea for relief.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The user is *seeking* a ""non painful way,"" but not stating a specific one.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned. ""28 years"" refers to the duration of pain, not a past attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post does not explicitly use the words ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""self-harm."" However, the phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" strongly implies a desire to end their life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""always tired,"" ""so tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""tired of being sick,"" ""pushing everyone away,"" ""saying hurtful things,"" ""lonely,"" ""jealous."" These indicate profound exhaustion, hopelessness, despair, isolation, and regret.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances for suicide) are mentioned. No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present. The line ""none of the pills do enough and i'm almost out of ones to try"" refers to medication for an illness, not as a means for suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" is a direct, albeit implicitly phrased, expression of wanting to end their life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings and future intentions (""ready to get this over with soon"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** This category is for no explicit suicidal expression or resolved issues. The post clearly has an implicit but strong suicidal expression (""ready to get this over with soon"").
    *   **ideation:** This category is for explicit suicidal expression but no plan or tendency to commit suicide. While there is no explicit *plan*, the phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon"" goes beyond mere thoughts or wishes. It suggests a state of readiness for the act to occur.
    *   **behavior:** This category requires explicit suicidal expression and a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" The phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon"" implies a readiness to take action, indicating a *tendency to act out*, even without a specific method or detailed plan. It's a step beyond just thinking about it; it's a statement of being prepared for the desired outcome.
    *   **attempt:** This category requires mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. No such mention exists.

    Based on the strong implicit expression of wanting to end life and the phrase ""I'm ready to get this over with soon,"" which suggests a readiness for action (a ""tendency to act out""), the post aligns best with the 'behavior' category, despite the lack of a specific plan.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft"". It also mentions ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over,"" indicating a desire to end distress through self-harm, even if not explicitly death. The phrase ""it'll punish me"" indicates self-harming intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I regret everything"", ""suffering"", ""punish me"", ""nuisance to society"", ""I'm sorry"" convey strong negative emotions, regret, self-blame, and distress.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method is mentioned: ""overdosed"" with ""500mg Zoloft"". The action has already occurred.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I finally went through"" and ""I have overdosed"" describe a very recent, completed self-harming act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the user states ""I don't want to die"". However, a specific act of self-harm (overdose) is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over."" This indicates a desire to escape suffering, leading to a self-harming act.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdosed"", ""took 500mg Zoloft"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The act has already been carried out (""I finally went through,"" ""I have overdosed"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a very recent, ongoing event: ""I finally went through,"" ""I have overdosed,"" ""It hasn't been that long,"" ""I'm getting a headache and some other bullshit."" This is a current/very recent action.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a recent overdose is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes a concrete action of self-harm (overdose) that has just occurred. The categories are 'indicator', 'ideation', 'behavior', and 'attempt'.
    *   'indicator' is incorrect as there is explicit self-harm.
    *   'ideation' is incorrect as there is a physical act, not just thoughts.
    *   'behavior' refers to ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While an overdose is a self-harm behavior, the category 'attempt' is more specific.
    *   'attempt' refers to ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" An overdose, even if the stated intent is not death (ambivalent intent is common), is widely considered a suicide attempt in clinical and risk assessment contexts, especially when done with the intent to cause harm or escape suffering. The phrases ""I finally went through"" and ""I have overdosed"" clearly indicate a recent, completed act that fits the definition of a suicide attempt. The user's statement ""it won't kill me"" does not negate the act being an attempt, as many attempts are not lethal or are made with mixed intentions.

    Therefore, 'attempt' is the most fitting classification due to the explicit mention of a recent overdose.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" ""ready to go,"" ""I'm ready."" These phrases strongly imply an intent to end one's life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I feel so at peace right now"" - this can be a concerning sign, sometimes indicating a decision has been made.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method is mentioned. However, ""I'm doing it in the near future"" indicates a timeline and a decision to act. ""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend"" could be interpreted as a form of 'tying up loose ends' or 'saying goodbye', which is a sign of preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrases ""I'm doing it,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" ""ready to go,"" and ""I'm ready"" are direct and unambiguous expressions of intent to end one's life. Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrases clearly convey this intent.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the statement ""I'm doing it in the near future"" implies a decided plan and timeline. The act of spending ""some good time with my favourite person over the weekend"" followed by feeling ""ready to go"" can be interpreted as a farewell or preparation for an imminent act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""ready to go"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) because it states a clear intention and timeline (""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""I'm ready"").
   - While no specific method is named, the phrase ""I'm doing it in the near future"" combined with the feeling of peace and the potential 'goodbye' suggests a clear *tendency to act out* or a *plan* that has been decided upon. This fits the definition of 'behavior' which includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""i was suicidal"")
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the expression is in the past tense (""i *was* suicidal"") and refers to a past state, not a current desire.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""it was 4 yrs ago"" - This clearly refers to a past event and a past state of being suicidal. There is no indication of current suicidal intent or ideation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, it describes *being* suicidal in the past, not an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""i was suicidal,"" but it is framed entirely in the past (""it was 4 yrs ago"").
   - The primary focus of the post is recounting a negative past experience related to being suicidal, not expressing current suicidal thoughts or intentions.
   - The definition of 'indicator' includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" While not explicitly stating ""I'm fine now,"" the temporal framing as a past event means it's not a current suicidal expression. It's a historical reference to a suicidal state, implying it's not a current active issue.
   - There is no current explicit suicidal expression (which would be 'ideation').
   - There is no plan or tendency to act out (which would be 'behavior').
   - There is no mention of a suicide attempt (which would be 'attempt').

   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions/questions (""Should I just go and kill myself?"", ""Might as well just die.""). The ""not the first time, not the last one"" refers to the sadness, not suicidal acts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"", ""die""). This eliminates 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for self-harm or suicide. This eliminates 'behavior'.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. This eliminates 'attempt'.
   - The content clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and desires (""Should I just go and kill myself?"", ""Might as well just die."") but without any concrete plan or immediate tendency to act. This aligns with 'ideation'.

63,i should die. Then my family doesn't need to raise trash anymore with their efforts. then they would live a better life. if I keep living on the earth they have to support me for the rest of their lives and never find their peace. I am just rubbish sucking at everything. I hate my family I have no friends I am so sensitive. I don't think it makes any sense that they have to raise me. tho I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything. I still hate that why everyone was born in a rich family at least not that poor like me. I just hate them that if u are not qualified to give at least average life to ur children then why u still give birth to them and suffer from u? fuck,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""i should die"", ""kill myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I am just rubbish sucking at everything""), self-loathing, feeling like a burden (""they have to support me for the rest of their lives and never find their peace""), anger/resentment (""I hate my family"", ""I just hate them that if u are not qualified to give at least average life to ur children then why u still give birth to them and suffer from u? fuck"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""tho I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything."" This explicitly states preparation.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""i should die"", ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""i should die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have prepared everything."" This is a clear indication of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""i should die"" indicates current desire/future intention. ""made up my mind to kill myself a few days"" refers to a past decision, but ""I have prepared everything"" indicates a current state of preparation for a future act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""i should die"", ""kill myself""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - The post explicitly states ""I have prepared everything."" This indicates a clear ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - While a decision was made ""a few days"" ago, the preparation is current. There is no mention of a *completed* or *attempted* act, only preparation for one.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'behavior' category which includes explicit suicidal expression and a plan or tendency to act out suicide, as evidenced by the preparation. It does not describe an actual attempt, which would classify it as 'attempt'.

Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body. Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol, a canteen, and the clothes on my back. As for my roommates, they're not dumb, they'll be able to put 2 and 2 together. But will most likely be unphased by the realization. I hope they enjoy my stuff, cuz they never seemed to enjoy my company.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""vanish without a trace"", ""no one will find my body"", ""pistol"", ""put 2 and 2 together"" (strongly implying suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: ""nothing to look forward to"", ""tired of my presence"", ""unphased by the realization"", ""never seemed to enjoy my company"". These indicate feelings of hopelessness, despair, and rejection.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them, pick a direction, and start walking. No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes. Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body. Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol, a canteen, and the clothes on my back."" This describes a very detailed plan, including method (""pistol"") and preparation steps.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, the phrases ""vanish without a trace"", ""no one will find my body"", and the mention of a ""pistol"" with the context of ""put 2 and 2 together"" constitute explicit suicidal expression through strong implication.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""want to vanish without a trace"", ""untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body"" clearly express a desire to die and not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""pistol"" is mentioned as the means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them, pick a direction, and start walking. No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes. Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot"" describes detailed steps of preparation and execution.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to future intentions, contingent on a specific event (""When that happens I will have nothing to look forward to. So I would want to vanish... Only things I plan to have on me at the end..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (though implied rather than using the word ""suicide"").
   - Crucially, it outlines a very detailed plan, including a specific method (""pistol"") and clear steps of preparation and execution (""empty bank account"", ""leave belongings"", ""walk to secluded spot"", ""no phone or car""). This clearly indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - It does not describe a past or recent attempt. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die"", ""i give up now""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on ""plan or tendency to commit suicide"" for 'behavior' versus ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"" for 'ideation'.
    *   The phrase ""Im this fucking close"" strongly indicates a *tendency to act out* or a proximity to acting on the suicidal feelings, even without a specific plan or method being stated. This goes beyond mere thoughts (ideation) and suggests a strong impulse or being on the verge of action. Therefore, it fits the ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" part of the 'behavior' category.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly states ""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years"", refers to ""when i do do it"", expresses not wanting ""the existance ive got"", and mentions past ""self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one cares right now"", ""so disconected"", ""rotting away""), despair, isolation (""pushed eveyone who mattered away"", ""on my own""), feeling misunderstood by professionals, feeling ""on the edge"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: States ""ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while"", ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it"", and ""how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police."" Mentions not having ""gone and got a rope"" but the other details are concrete planning.
   - References to past attempts: Mentions past *self-harm* (""scratch and punch my self in the face"") but no explicit past *suicide attempts*.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""Ive been suicidal"", ""when i do do it"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post clearly contains explicit suicidal expression.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a specific location for suicide and a plan for post-event discovery (notes). This indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out... suicide"".
   - It also explicitly mentions historical experience of ""self-harm behaviour"".
   - There is no mention of a *recent* suicide attempt or historical *suicide attempts*, distinguishing it from the 'attempt' category.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit.

Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal,"" ""tonight's the night I guess,"" ""when I'm gone,"" ""help me stay alive.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""desperate,"" ""hopeless.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""tonight's the night I guess"" strongly implies an imminent plan to act, though no specific method is named.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""suicidal"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""cutting an artery"" is a direct and explicit mention of a method of self-harm that is typically fatal.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask"" indicates distress, isolation, and a desperate need for information related to the contemplated act.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""oxy and cutting an artery"" explicitly names a method and a substance (OxyContin) being considered in conjunction with the method. The question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" is a direct inquiry about the practical execution and pain management for this specific suicidal act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""cutting an artery"" is a widely recognized and explicit method of suicide/self-harm. The context of asking about pain management for this act strongly implies suicidal intent.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Not directly, but the detailed inquiry about executing a lethal act implies a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""cutting an artery"" is a specific lethal method. ""Oxy"" is mentioned as a means to facilitate the act by reducing pain.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The question about using oxy to lessen pain *when* cutting an artery indicates active contemplation, research, and planning regarding the execution of the act. It's not just a general thought, but an inquiry into the mechanics of a specific method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The phrasing ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" refers to a hypothetical future action, indicating current contemplation and potential future intention.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': This is incorrect. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (via the method) and a clear tendency/plan.
    *   'ideation': This is incorrect. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post goes beyond mere ideation by discussing specific methods and asking practical questions about their execution, indicating a ""plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
    *   'behavior': This category fits well. The post has ""explicit suicidal expression"" (the mention of ""cutting an artery"") and clearly shows a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" by discussing specific methods (""oxy and cutting an artery"") and asking a practical question about pain management during the act.
    *   'attempt': This is incorrect. The post is a question about how to perform the act, not a report of a recent or historical attempt.

A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" multiple times. However, these are direct quotes or paraphrases of what the *friend* said about the poster, or the poster's hypothetical rephrasing of the friend's intent (""If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide""). The poster is reacting to these external statements, not expressing their own suicidal intent.
   - Note emotional indicators: The poster expresses feeling hurt, upset, confused (""I have no idea what to do""), feeling like a ""doormat,"" and struggling with mental illness (""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"").
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the poster.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None mentioned by the poster. The poster mentions ""trying to make a joke of it"" and ""doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" which indicates coping, not past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The mentions of suicide are in the context of what the *friend* said about the poster, not the poster's own desire. The poster states, ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" which suggests a desire to live and cope.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The core event is a past conversation (""A couple of weeks ago my friend told me...""). The poster is currently processing the emotional impact of those words and seeking advice on how to handle the ongoing relationship. There are no current or future suicidal intentions expressed by the poster.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post discusses suicide, but it's not an expression of the *poster's own* suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt. The poster is reacting to a hurtful comment made by a friend *about* the poster's potential suicide. The poster explicitly states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness"" and is seeking advice on a social interaction. Since the suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, and the poster is not expressing personal suicidal intent, the content falls under 'indicator' as it has no explicit suicidal expression *from the poster*.

   - 'indicator': This post goes far beyond just an indicator; there is explicit intent and a plan.
   - 'ideation': While there is explicit suicidal expression, there is also a clear plan (""jump out"") and a strong tendency/imminence (""at my window right now with scissors, i feel like im about to""). This is more than just ideation without a plan.
   - 'behavior': This category states ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""jump out"") and a very clear plan (""at my window... with scissors... jump out"") with an immediate tendency to act (""right now"", ""im about to""). This fits perfectly.
   - 'attempt': The post describes an *imminent* action, not a *recent* or historical attempt. The act has not yet occurred.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""iron pills"" and ""overdose.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""i'm gonna overdose"" implies a current intent and potentially having the means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""i'm gonna overdose"" refers to a current/future intention to act.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""im going to kill myself one day"", ""might as well die"", ""i just want to disappear"", ""run away to a forest and fucking die"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (deferred from dream school, slim chances of escape), despair (""my life, i dont even know what that is""), feeling like a failure, anger, desire to escape/disappear.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The phrase ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" suggests a location and outcome, but no specific method (e.g., tool, substance) or signs of preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. (""im going to kill myself one day"", ""might as well die"", ""run away to a forest and fucking die"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned. ""Run away to a forest"" is a location, not a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - ""im going to kill myself one day"" refers to a future, but vague, intention.
   - ""might as well die"" and ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" express current strong desires.
   - The final sentence ""the only thing thats stopping is that there is still a chance to get in to a college somewhere far, far away... but the chances of that are so slim so i dont even know"" indicates a current strong desire to die, but also a significant *stopping factor* or *contingency* that is currently preventing action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on the presence of a *plan* or *tendency to act out*. While the desire to ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" is intense, it lacks a specific method or concrete steps of preparation. Crucially, the post explicitly states ""the only thing thats stopping is that there is still a chance to get in to a college"". This indicates a strong protective factor currently preventing the ""tendency to act out"". Therefore, while the ideation is severe, it does not meet the criteria for a concrete plan or immediate tendency to act out as defined by 'behavior'.

74,"Hoping to be murdered. I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die. I'm so hyperaware of how I'm clearly defective and unfit to be alive. It's like I have a terminal illness no one recognizes. I just have to pray for some random person to murder me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Hoping to be murdered"", ""hate being alive"", ""don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"", ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me"", ""assisted suicide"", ""terminally suicidal people"", ""wish so badly for me to get murdered"", ""end it all"", ""stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself"", ""want to die"", ""unfit to be alive"", ""pray for some random person to murder me.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, feeling useless and alone, constant crying.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself."" The user wishes to be murdered and mentions ""walk through sketchy areas every night"" as a means for this to happen, but this is a passive desire for an external event, not an active, self-initiated plan for suicide. There are no signs of preparation for self-harm or suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill myself"", ""assisted suicide"", ""terminally suicidal people"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Hoping to be murdered"", ""I hate being alive"", ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me"", ""I want to die"", ""unfit to be alive"", ""pray for some random person to murder me.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The desire to be murdered is mentioned, with ""walking through sketchy areas"" as a passive exposure. However, the critical point is the explicit statement ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself."" This indicates a *lack* of a self-initiated plan or method for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and ongoing desires for death (""every single day is the same thing"", ""every night"", ""every day I'm forced to realize""). The intentions are current and future-oriented regarding the desire for death.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression and a strong desire for death (""want to die"", ""kill myself"", ""end it all""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The user explicitly states they lack the bravery to kill themselves and instead wishes for an external force (murder) to end their life. While they expose themselves to ""sketchy areas"" hoping for this, it is not a *self-initiated plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide*. The core of the post is the intense desire for death coupled with an inability or unwillingness to act on it themselves.
   - The definition of 'ideation' is ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This aligns perfectly with the user's statement of lacking the bravery to kill themselves and relying on an external event.
   - The definition of 'behavior' requires a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The user's explicit statement negates a self-initiated plan, and the passive wish for murder, while concerning, does not constitute a *self-initiated* plan to commit suicide.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression and the stated *lack* of a self-initiated plan or tendency to commit suicide, the post falls under 'ideation'.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No explicit method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) or preparation is mentioned. However, ""I'll experience it painfully"" suggests a chosen *manner* of death. ""I'm going to leave"" is a statement of intent to act.
   - References to past attempts: None.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is stated. ""I'll experience it painfully"" describes an attribute of a potential method, not the method itself.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I think I'm going to leave"", ""See you all on the other side""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - While no specific *plan* (method, location) is detailed, the language strongly conveys a *tendency to act out* self-harm or suicide. Phrases like ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"", ""I'll experience it painfully"", ""I think I'm going to leave"", ""I can't take no more"", and the farewell ""See you all on the other side"" indicate a clear decision and intent to act, moving beyond mere ideation. The desire for a painful experience also points towards a self-harming aspect.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The criteria for 'behavior' include ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The post clearly demonstrates a strong tendency and intent to act.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm stopping all my meds today.

Stopping medication, especially psychiatric medication, and quitting therapy are direct actions that remove protective factors and can significantly worsen mental and physical health, increasing suicide risk. The ""soda and junk"" comment, while passive, is stated as a deliberate method to accelerate death.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None explicitly mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I'm ready to die"", ""Hope it all ends soon"").

These are direct behavioral intentions that would remove protective factors and likely lead to a worsening of the user's condition, increasing the risk of self-harm or suicide. The statement ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" also indicates a deliberate, albeit passive, method. This goes beyond mere ideation into concrete behavioral intentions.
    *   There is no mention of a past or recent suicide *attempt*.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression combined with stated plans/tendencies to act (stopping meds, quitting therapy), the 'behavior' category is the best fit.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mention of these words. However, ""I just want to disappear"" and ""free from all this pain"" (referring to the soul) strongly imply a desire for non-existence or an end to suffering.
   - Emotional indicators: ""broken remainings of my soul"", ""pain"" indicate severe emotional distress and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not by name.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to disappear"" is a direct expression of wanting to cease to exist, which is a form of wanting to not be alive. ""free from all this pain"" reinforces this desire for an ultimate escape from suffering. This qualifies as explicit suicidal expression in the form of a wish for non-existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention/feeling (""I just want to disappear"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression in the form of a desire for non-existence (""disappear,"" ""free from all this pain"") due to overwhelming pain. However, there is no mention of a plan, method, or tendency to act, nor any historical self-harm or attempt. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" It does not fit 'indicator' as there is explicit suicidal expression, and it does not fit 'behavior' or 'attempt' due to the lack of plan/action/history.

I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (related to a failed attempt), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"", ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""uncontrollably saying"", ""almost like Tourettes"", ""am I crazy"", indicating distress and a compulsive nature of these expressions.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No concrete current plan or method for an *actual* suicide/self-harm act. The finger gun is a simulation. ""Gonna hurt myself really badly"" is general.
   - References to past attempts: Explicitly states ""my most recent failed attempt"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I'm going to kill myself"", ""failed attempt"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I wish I stayed in the car"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *current* plan or method for a *future* act. The ""finger gun"" is a simulated action.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both:
     - Past event: ""my most recent failed attempt"".
     - Current/future expressions/intentions: ""I'm going to kill myself"" (uncontrollably saying), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" (uncontrollably saying), ""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out"" (current behavior/expression).

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm going to kill myself"").
   - It describes current behaviors that simulate self-harm/suicide (""putting a finger gun in my mouth"").
   - Crucially, it explicitly mentions ""my most recent failed attempt"".
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'indicator' is incorrect as there is explicit suicidal expression and a past attempt.
     - 'ideation' is incorrect as there is more than just ideation; there's a past attempt.
     - 'behavior' includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"". While the finger gun and ""gonna hurt myself"" could lean towards behavior, the definition of 'attempt' is more precise for the explicit mention of a *suicide attempt*.
     - 'attempt' states: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The phrase ""my most recent failed attempt"" directly matches the ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"" part of this definition. This is the strongest and most direct match.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me. Girls and guys. I hate my life. I've lost all my sanity and I don't know what to do.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore."", ""I'm angry and suicidal."", ""I hate my life.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and intentions (""I genuinely do not want to live anymore."", ""I'm angry and suicidal"") stemming from past experiences.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expressions (""I genuinely do not want to live anymore."", ""suicidal"", ""I hate my life.""). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or any tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. There is also no mention of historical self-harm behavior or suicide attempts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation'.

I thought I was doing fine but just today I realised none of my other friends really give a shit about me. They'll happily talk away while I listen but the second i try and tell a story of my own they shut off completely, let alone if I try to be open about how much I'm struggling. I started college this year and its been so horrible. I was robbed of a place to stay so I've had to live at home while everyone else has parties and enjoys their college experience. I haven't made a single friend, let alone done anything fun. At this point it just feels like I'm just going through the motions. Is this my life now?

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'd rather kill myself now""
   - Emotional indicators: ""endless torment"", ""horrible"", ""struggling"", ""don't want it"", ""nobody to talk to"", ""nothing to do"", ""going through the motions"", ""by myself""

I'm on a throwaway account so I'll probably never check it again.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to kill myself"", ""urge to just blow my brains out"", ""pull the trigger"", ""how it would feel to die"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""scared"", ""don't want to leave my cats/friends"", ""too much of a pussy"", ""can never bring myself to actually do it"". This indicates a conflict and an inability to act despite the urges.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""blow my brains out"", ""pull the trigger"" are mentioned as methods, but immediately negated by ""too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it"". There are no signs of preparation.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned. The phrase ""can never bring myself to actually do it"" suggests no prior attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I want to kill myself"", ""urge to just blow my brains out"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to kill myself"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" imply a firearm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states the inability to act on these thoughts (""too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"", ""I can never bring myself to actually do it""). This indicates ideation about methods, not a plan or tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current urges and thoughts (""every single day I still have the urge"", ""I lay in bed at night, thoughts... rushing through my head""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - While methods are mentioned, the explicit statements ""I'm scared"", ""I don't want to leave my cats/friends"", ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"", and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it"" clearly indicate that there is no *plan or tendency to act out* the suicide. The mention of a method is part of the intrusive thoughts and urges, not a concrete step towards action.
   - There is no mention of historical self-harm behavior or suicide attempts, ruling out 'behavior' (for historical self-harm) and 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""murder me"", ""end my horrible life"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i beg of you"" highlights desperation and extreme distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""i'll dm the address, please come here and murder me"" indicates a specific method (being murdered) and a clear step towards preparation (providing a location/address).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the expressions ""kill me"", ""murder me"", ""end my horrible life"" are direct and explicit expressions of a desire for death.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, multiple times.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""murder me"" by someone coming to ""the address"". This is a specific means of ending life.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""i'll dm the address"" is a clear indication of willingness to provide means (location) for the desired outcome.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""kill me"", ""i'll dm the address"", ""please come here and murder me"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by offering a specific plan (""murder me"") and a clear step towards facilitating it (""i'll dm the address""). This constitutes a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" as per the 'behavior' category definition, even if it involves another person. It's an active step towards ending their life.
   - It does not describe a past or recent attempt.

Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification because there is explicit suicidal expression and a clear indication of a plan/tendency to act out suicide by facilitating it.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""practicing hanging myself"", ""finally do it"", ""deserves to die"", ""thinking of death"", ""this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon"". Explicit and frequent mentions.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""life is fucked now"", ""no turning it around"", ""worthless trash"", ""no one is going to convince me otherwise"", ""pain"", ""The thought makes me so happy"", ""great solace"". Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and a perverse sense of relief/happiness associated with death.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""practicing hanging myself"", ""I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed"". This clearly describes a specific method (hanging) and active, ongoing preparation/rehearsal for the act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past *completed* attempts are mentioned. ""Practicing"" refers to current and ongoing preparatory behaviors, not a past suicide attempt.

    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes. ""hanging myself"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes. ""practicing hanging myself"", ""keep practicing"", ""train myself to break this natural survival instinct"". This is direct evidence of preparation and rehearsal.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Primarily current and future intentions. ""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it"", ""I'm going to keep practicing"", ""I will succeed"", ""will be over soon"". The ""practicing"" is an ongoing behavior in the present, leading to a future intended act.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No. The ""practicing"" is not described as a past *attempt* but as a current *preparatory behavior*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **'indicator'**: Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression and active preparation.
    *   **'ideation'**: Incorrect. This goes beyond mere thoughts or expressions of wanting to die. There is a specific method mentioned and active, behavioral preparation (""practicing hanging myself"").
    *   **'behavior'**: This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   Explicit suicidal expression: Yes.
        *   Plan or tendency to act out: Yes. ""Practicing hanging myself"" is a clear behavioral step, a form of preparation and rehearsal, demonstrating a strong tendency and intent to act out the suicide. This is active engagement in a behavior directly related to the planned suicide.
    *   **'attempt'**: Incorrect. The post describes *practicing* for a future act, not a recent or historical *completed* suicide attempt. The user explicitly states they ""can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" indicating the act itself has not yet occurred.

    Based on the analysis, the active ""practicing"" of the method, combined with explicit suicidal intent and a specific plan, fits the definition of 'behavior' as it signifies a clear tendency and preparation to act out self-harm/suicide.

I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this. I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them, to a clueless little dog. I want to die. I want to disappear. I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to die."", ""I want to disappear."", ""I will take myself away from here"". These are direct expressions of suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I know i'm a piece of shit."", ""feel like absolute shit"", ""I hate people who yell and explode and i am one of them"", ""I am on the edge"". These indicate severe self-loathing, despair, and being at a breaking point.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method or detailed plan is mentioned (e.g., a specific tool, location, or substance). However, there is a clear statement of future intent: ""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"". This indicates a tendency to act.
   - References to past attempts: No past suicide attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""I want to die."", ""I will take myself away from here"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.
   - However, the statement ""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"" indicates a strong *tendency* and *intention* to act in the future, even without a specific method or immediate plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post expresses current distress and clear future intentions (""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here""). It does not describe past suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
   - 'ideation': While there is explicit suicidal expression, the phrase ""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"" goes beyond mere thoughts or desires. It indicates a clear *tendency* or *intention* to act in the future, even without a specific method being detailed. This moves it beyond simple ideation.
   - 'behavior': This category includes explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die"", ""I will take myself away from here"") and a clear *tendency to act* (""if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here""). This fits the definition of 'behavior' due to the expressed tendency to act, driven by the desire to prevent hurting others.
   - 'attempt': Incorrect, as no recent or historical suicide attempt is mentioned.

The presence of explicit suicidal expression combined with a stated future intention/tendency to act (""one day i will take myself away from here"") classifies this as 'behavior'.

I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I just don't want to exist."" It also explicitly mentions suicide twice: ""Im not suicidal or something"" and ""I think that suicide is selfish.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feel like trash,"" ""don't know what's wrong with me,"" ""don't know what to do anymore,"" ""draining me,"" ""anxiety attacks,"" ""don't have any purpose in life,"" ""feel like disappointment."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and lack of purpose.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, the word ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" are used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""I just don't want to exist.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current feelings (""I feel like trash,"" ""I just don't want to exist"") and future uncertainty (""I don't know what will i do after college""). It also mentions past events that led to these feelings (lockdown, studying).
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains the phrase ""I just don't want to exist,"" which is a form of passive suicidal ideation (a wish not to be alive).
    *   However, immediately following this, the user explicitly states, ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish."" This is a direct denial of suicidal intent and a moral stance against suicide.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.
    *   There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   Comparing the categories:
        *   'attempt' and 'behavior' are ruled out due to the absence of plans, actions, or historical attempts/self-harm.
        *   'ideation' requires ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" While ""I just don't want to exist"" is an explicit expression, the subsequent strong denial (""Im not suicidal or something"") and moral objection (""I think that suicide is selfish"") indicate that the suicidal *idea* is being actively rejected or resolved by the poster.
        *   'indicator' states ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression *or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues*."" The explicit denial ""Im not suicidal or something"" and the stated belief ""I think that suicide is selfish"" directly address and negate the suicidal intent, fitting the ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues"" or at least a current lack of suicidal intent despite the despair. The overall message regarding *suicide action* is one of denial, placing the risk lower than active ideation.

    Therefore, despite the deep despair and passive death wish, the explicit negation of being suicidal leads to classifying this as an 'indicator' of distress rather than active suicidal ideation or higher risk categories.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicitly mentions ""death"", ""taking my life"" multiple times, ""suicide"", ""suicidal"", and ""attempted suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness""), worthlessness (""useless"", ""too dumb to function""), feeling controlled, despair, existential crisis, feeling exploited, sadness, and a sense of being trapped.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific *future* plan or method is detailed. However, the post mentions drafting a note *prior to* a past attempt.
   - References to past attempts: Yes, explicitly states: ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note..."" and ""(Un)fortunately my attempt had failed"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The words ""suicide"", ""suicidal"", and phrases like ""taking my life"" are used directly.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I dont know what I truly want besides death."", ""I want to take my life"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *current* or *future* methods are mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of *current* preparation. The drafting of a note was in preparation for the *past* attempt.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. There is clear mention of a past suicide attempt (""I attempted suicide last week""). There are also current expressions of suicidal desire (""I want to take my life"", ""The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I attempted suicide last week"" and ""my attempt had failed"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   Based on the analysis:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to take my life"", ""I am sucidal"").
   - Most importantly, the post explicitly describes a recent suicide attempt: ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note..."" and ""(Un)fortunately my attempt had failed"".
   - The definition for 'attempt' is: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This perfectly aligns with the content of the post. While there is also ideation and a history of self-harm (implicitly through the attempt), the direct mention of a recent attempt places it firmly in the 'attempt' category.

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""kill you"", ""I just want this nightmare to end"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" (fear of failure in an attempt), ""I just want this nightmare to end"" (despair, wanting to escape suffering through death).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""valium"" is mentioned as the method. The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that the method has *already been used*.
   - References to past attempts: ""I haven't taken enough"" strongly implies a recent action that was intended as a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill you"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want this nightmare to end"" in the context of taking a substance to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""valium"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post indicates that the Valium has *already been taken* (""I haven't taken enough""), which is beyond preparation; it's an action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I haven't taken enough"" refers to a *recent action* (taking Valium) that was intended to be lethal. The question ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" suggests a current desire to complete the action or ensure its success.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the phrasing ""I haven't taken enough"" directly describes a recent, ongoing, or just-completed action that constitutes an attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states that Valium has been taken with the intent to die (""kill you""), and the person is concerned it wasn't enough. This is a clear indication of a recent action that was intended to be a suicide attempt. It directly matches the definition of the 'attempt' category.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I don't want to live at all,"" ""cheating death,"" and directly refers to ""suicide attempts."" It describes a ""suicide note"" and a self-harm act (""sliced hard and fast across my neck"") in the context of a suicide attempt.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't want to live at all"" indicates current despair/hopelessness. ""it's like I just don't die"" suggests a desire for death even in accidental contexts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: For past events, specific methods are detailed: ""bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one,"" ""took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck,"" and ""took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail."" Preparation includes buying pills and writing a suicide note. No current plans or preparations are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: The post explicitly states ""Some of these are suicide attempts"" and then provides detailed narratives of at least three distinct past suicide attempts (pills at age 16, razor in Nov 2020, prescription cocktail in Nov 2020).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The post uses the phrase ""suicide attempts"" multiple times and describes actions intended to end life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I don't want to live at all.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, for past events: Unisom pills, straight razor, prescription cocktail.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, for past events: buying pills, writing a suicide note.
   - For current intentions, no specific plan or method is mentioned. The motorcycle incident is explicitly stated not to be a suicide attempt.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The core of the post details historical experiences of suicide attempts (""The first one came when I was 16,"" ""Next one was in November 2020""). There is a current expression of not wanting to live (""I don't want to live at all""), but this is not accompanied by a current plan or action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I don't want to live at all"").
   - It does not describe a *current* plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.
   - However, the most prominent and detailed content is the recounting of multiple ""historical experience of suicide attempt.""
   - The definition for the 'attempt' category is: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
   - This post perfectly matches the ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"" part of the 'attempt' definition, as it explicitly describes several past suicide attempts with methods and outcomes.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""kill myself"", ""ready to be done"", ""so close to just doing it"", ""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""All failing"", ""feel my liver hurt every day"", ""wants a divorce"", ""ruin my life over it"", ""so stressed out over everything"", ""business is just about to fail"", ""fucking everything up now"", ""started crying"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, despair, and feeling overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight."" This describes a specific method (hanging/strangulation) and a specific location, and the initiation of the act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This describes a very recent (tonight) act that was initiated with suicidal intent and was self-interrupted. This is often classified as a self-interrupted suicide attempt or a near-fatal self-harm act.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""ready to be done"", ""so close to just doing it"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself"", ""I'm ready to be done"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of putting the belt around the neck and positioning oneself is a direct action taken towards the method, indicating preparation and intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent past event (""tonight"") that was an initiated suicidal act, and also current/future intentions (""I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It describes a specific method and the *initiation* of a suicidal act (""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob... Right before I passed out, I stopped""). This goes beyond mere ideation or a general plan/tendency; it is an enacted behavior with clear suicidal intent that was only stopped at the last moment.
    *   While the act was self-interrupted, it is widely considered a ""suicide attempt"" in clinical contexts because the individual took direct action with the intent to die. The phrase ""Right before I passed out"" indicates the act was very close to causing serious harm or death.
    *   The category ""attempt"" is defined as ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The event ""tonight"" fits ""recent suicide attempt"" even though it was self-interrupted. It was a direct action taken with suicidal intent.
    *   The 'behavior' category mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"", which this act technically is, but ""suicide attempt"" is a more specific and severe classification for an act initiated with intent to die. Given the severity of the action taken, 'attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds"" (explicit wishes for specific methods of self-harm/death).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""no body cares"", ""no motivation"", ""fucked myself over"", ""parents don't even care"", ""no one left to turn to"", ""my closest friends have other people that they would rather be with"", ""i don't feel like anything anymore it's just blank"" (strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, isolation, anhedonia).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""get hit by a car or od on meds"" (mentions specific methods, indicating a tendency or desire for these actions, though not a concrete plan with steps).
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds"" directly expresses a wish for death or severe self-harm.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""get hit by a car"" and ""od on meds"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and future wishes/intentions (""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression (""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds"").
    *   **ideation:** This category is for ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" While there's explicit expression, the mention of specific methods (""get hit by a car or od on meds"") suggests a *tendency* or a specific desire for self-harm/suicide by those means, which goes beyond mere ideation.
    *   **behavior:** This category states ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post has explicit suicidal expression. The mention of specific methods (""get hit by a car or od on meds"") indicates a *tendency* to act out self-harm or suicide using these means. Even if not a concrete plan, the specificity of the methods aligns with the ""tendency to act out"" clause. There is no historical behavior mentioned, but the current tendency is present.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the explicit mention of specific methods (""get hit by a car or od on meds"") which implies a *tendency* towards these actions, the post fits the 'behavior' category more accurately than 'ideation' where such tendencies/methods are explicitly absent.

Call this gatekeeping depression I don't care, but if you're depressed as an attractive person go fuck yourself. You can't begin to imagine the daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body. Being unwanted in literally all facets of life from growing up to adulthood. If youre attractive the world is literally your oyster, I would never stop smiling I was born that way.

I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No explicit mentions of these terms.
   - Note emotional indicators: ""daily torture of living life,"" ""Being unwanted in literally all facets of life,"" ""I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way."" These indicate deep despair, self-loathing, and profound unhappiness with one's current state.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None present.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses extreme dissatisfaction with life and a desire to have been born differently, but not an explicit wish for death or non-existence.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It describes a current, ongoing state of suffering and a hypothetical desire for a different past/existence. There are no explicit future intentions related to self-harm or suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post expresses significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and a sense of worthlessness. However, it *lacks* any explicit suicidal expression (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I will kill myself""). It does not mention any plans, methods, or past attempts. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt'. It fits the 'indicator' category, which covers posts with no explicit suicidal expression.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""me being suicidal"", ""tried to kill myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired of people's ignorance"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for current intent.
   - References to past attempts: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""me being suicidal"", ""tried to kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""me being suicidal"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation, and the context of past attempts reinforces a history of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past events (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"") and current feelings/state (""me being suicidal"", ""I'm tired""). The most concrete and high-risk information is the historical experience.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times.""

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly mentions ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" This directly matches the definition of the 'attempt' category: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""i'm better off dead"" is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts. The subsequent ""don't do that"" confirms the context is about suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The post contrasts common advice about relationships with the reaction to expressing suicidal thoughts, suggesting a feeling of being misunderstood or a struggle with these thoughts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the phrase ""i'm better off dead"" and the implied context of ""don't do that"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i'm better off dead"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current internal state or thought (""when i say i'm better off dead"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit suicidal expression (""i'm better off dead"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or a clear tendency to act on these thoughts.
   - There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""overdose"", ""took 44 paracetamol"", ""I don't think I want to die"" (implying the action was taken with that potential outcome in mind), ""did this to myself"". The user is asking ""could I survive an od like this"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""sorry"", ""don't know where else to post/ask this"", ""stomach is hurting very badly"", ""sweating badly and shaking too"", ""feel like a burden"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post describes an action that has *already occurred*: ""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"". This is the method.
   - References to past attempts: The post describes a *recent* event, not a past one.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the term ""overdose"" and the act of taking a large quantity of pills (""44 paracetamol"") with the context of asking for help and questioning survival clearly indicates a suicide attempt, even if the current intent is wavering (""I don't think I want to die"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The initial action of taking the pills suggests an intent to harm oneself, potentially fatally. While the post states ""I don't think I want to die"" *now*, the action taken is a direct expression of severe distress leading to a potentially fatal act.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""44 paracetamol"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act has already been carried out (""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago""). This is not preparation, but the act itself.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent past event (""almost an hour ago"") with ongoing physical symptoms and immediate consequences. The user is currently experiencing the effects of the overdose.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The post describes a *recent* suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression and a clear self-harm action.
   - 'ideation': Incorrect. This is not just thoughts or expressions of wanting to die; a concrete, potentially fatal action has been taken.
   - 'behavior': This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While the act is self-harm behavior, the severity and the user's question about survival (""could I survive an od like this"") elevate it beyond general self-harm behavior to a suicide attempt.
   - 'attempt': This category includes ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The post explicitly describes taking a large overdose of paracetamol ""almost an hour ago,"" is experiencing severe physical symptoms, and asks if they can ""survive an od like this."" This clearly fits the definition of a ""recent suicide attempt.""

The post describes a completed, recent act of self-harm that is being treated by the user as a potentially fatal overdose, directly aligning with the definition of a ""recent suicide attempt"".

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to end it"" is a clear expression of wanting to die/end one's life.
   - Note emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness (implied by the desire to ""end it"").

This aligns directly with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" It does not fit 'behavior' because there's no plan or tendency to act, nor does it mention past self-harm behavior. It does not fit 'attempt' as no attempt is mentioned. It does not fit 'indicator' as there is explicit suicidal expression.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

These indicate severe distress, despair, and emotional exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. The phrase ""I'm back. It's been a year since I last posted here and I'm in the exact same situation"" suggests a recurring period of significant distress but not necessarily past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The post conveys extreme hopelessness and inability to cope, but not a direct statement of wanting to die or wishing for non-existence.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current feelings and a recurring pattern of distress (""back,"" ""exact same situation,"" ""again""). There are no stated future intentions of self-harm or suicide.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound emotional pain, hopelessness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed (""can't handle it anymore,"" ""completely hopeless""). It is a clear cry for help and indicates significant mental health struggles.
    *   However, according to the definitions:
        *   'attempt' requires explicit expression of a recent or historical suicide attempt. This is not present.
        *   'behavior' requires explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan/tendency to act out self-harm/suicide, or historical self-harm behavior. This is not present.
        *   'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm thinking of suicide"") but no plan. This is not present.
        *   'indicator' states ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This post contains no explicit suicidal expression. While the distress is very high and concerning, it does not cross the threshold into explicit suicidal ideation or behavior as defined by the categories. It serves as a strong indicator of severe distress and potential risk, but not explicit suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death"" is present, but it's used as an idiom for hitting rock bottom and is immediately followed by positive, hopeful statements about getting better. There are no explicit mentions of suicide or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: ""lonely and lost as ever"", ""scares me sometimes"", ""bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns"". However, these are largely framed as past experiences, with the current state being ""overall better"", ""feel more like myself"", ""starting to accept who I am"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts. The ""rock bottom"" described involves ""really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years"", which are struggles but not suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The mention of ""death"" is metaphorical/idiomatic in the context of hitting rock bottom, not a personal desire.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This post primarily refers to past struggles (""my rock bottom was..."", ""these last 2 years since i've been way better tho"") and current improvement/acceptance (""i'm in therapy again btw so it might get better for me"", ""i've been overall better"", ""feel more like myself"", ""starting to accept who i am""). The overall tone is one of resilience and hope.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past mental health struggles and ""rock bottom"" experiences.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post does not contain any explicit suicidal expression.
   - While it describes past severe mental health struggles (""rock bottom,"" ""bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns""), it clearly states that the individual is ""overall better,"" ""feel more like myself,"" and is ""starting to accept who I am."" They are also in therapy and express hope for improvement.
   - The mention of ""death"" is in the context of a philosophical statement about hitting rock bottom and is not an expression of suicidal intent.
   - The post ends with positive encouragement to others (""find a way to stay positive and stay safe"").
   - This aligns with the 'indicator' category, which covers posts with no explicit suicidal expression or explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues. The user is reflecting on past difficulties that are now improving.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""thats likely my go-to plan"" indicates a chosen method, even if the timing is uncertain and fear is present. This constitutes a ""tendency to act out"" with a specific means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""plan on ending it soon"", ""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""plan on ending it soon"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by identifying a specific method (""overdosibg on ibuprofen"") and stating it's ""likely my go-to plan"". This clearly indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I'd kill myself"")

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a gun"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The phrasing ""If I had a gun"" indicates a hypothetical desire rather than possession or active preparation of means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current suicidal ideation (""right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future"", ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'd kill myself"").
   - A method (""a gun"") is mentioned, but it is conditional (""If I had a gun""), indicating a lack of a concrete plan or immediate means/tendency to act. There are no signs of preparation or active steps towards suicide.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.
   - There is no mention of historical self-harm *behavior* related to suicide, only addiction relapse.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

It also states a timeline: ""I plan on doing it next week"". This indicates a concrete plan and intention to act.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself"" and the set timeline (""next week"") are strong signs of preparation and intent to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""My last time posting"", ""I've got a suicide plan"", ""I plan on doing it next week"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression and a plan.
   - 'ideation': Incorrect, as there is a clear plan and stated intention/tendency to commit suicide (""I've got a suicide plan"", ""I plan on doing it next week""). The definition of ideation specifies ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"".
   - 'behavior': This category states ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post explicitly states a ""suicide plan"" and a timeline (""next week""), which directly matches the criteria of having ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out... suicide"".
   - 'attempt': Incorrect, as the post describes a future plan, not a recent or historical attempt.

Based on the explicit mention of a ""suicide plan"" and the stated intention to act ""next week"", the post clearly falls under the 'behavior' category.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts"", ""attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"", ""begun having those thoughts again"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Feeling bad"", ""long history of depression"", ""pushed me back down"", ""massive amounts of pain"", ""feel terrible about it"", ""feel like a piece of crap"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No current plans or methods are mentioned. The post focuses on seeking help.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""attempted suicide"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct current expression of wanting to die. The post mentions having ""those thoughts again"" but also actively seeking help.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
        *   Past: ""attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"".
        *   Current: ""begun having those thoughts again"". The current focus is on seeking help and managing these thoughts, not acting on them (""I am going to try"" to follow through with appointments).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"".

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago).""
    *   According to the definition, the 'attempt' category applies if ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, *or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*.""
    *   This direct mention of a historical suicide attempt perfectly matches the criteria for the 'attempt' category. While there is also current ideation, the historical attempt takes precedence based on the specific definition provided for 'attempt'.

It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) and ""I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best."" There are no explicit mentions of suicide, death, or dying.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Dont even feel like a person anymore,"" ""can't socialize well,"" ""suffering,"" ""afraid he won't want baggage like me and leave,"" ""go insane,"" ""so many issues,"" ""never felt like that's been an option,"" ""getting to be too much."" These indicate severe emotional distress, feelings of isolation, hopelessness, and being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method, ""cut,"" is mentioned as a coping mechanism, but the user states they are currently unable to act on it due to external factors (""my bf will see""). There are no signs of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past *suicide attempts* are mentioned. However, the phrase ""cope in the way that works best"" in reference to cutting strongly implies a historical experience with self-harm behavior as a coping mechanism. ""Thoughts of sh"" indicates current ideation.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut"" is mentioned as a desired coping method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No, the user states they are *unable* to engage in the method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Thoughts of sh"" are current. The inability to ""cut"" is current. The overall feeling of being overwhelmed (""It's getting to be too much"") is current. The phrase ""cope in the way that works best"" implies past self-harm behavior.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No past suicide attempts. Past self-harm behavior is strongly implied.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** This is not 'indicator' because there are explicit mentions of ""thoughts of sh"" and a desire to self-harm, which are not resolved issues.
    *   **ideation:** While there's no explicit *suicidal* expression, there is explicit *self-harm* ideation (""thoughts of sh""). The definition of 'ideation' specifies ""suicidal expression"" without a plan or tendency. However, the 'behavior' category explicitly includes self-harm.
    *   **behavior:** The definition states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   While there's no explicit *suicidal* expression, there is explicit *self-harm* ideation (""thoughts of sh"").
        *   There is a clear *tendency* to act out self-harm (""I can't even cut... so I can't even cope in the way that works best"" implies a strong desire and past reliance on this method).
        *   There is a strong implication of *historical experience of self-harm behaviour* (""cope in the way that works best"" referring to cutting).
        This category best fits the description of current self-harm ideation, a strong tendency towards self-harm, and implied past self-harm behavior.
    *   **attempt:** There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Given the explicit mention of ""thoughts of sh"", the desire to ""cut"" as a coping mechanism, and the implication of past self-harm behavior, the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate fit as it encompasses self-harm tendencies and historical self-harm.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""when I die"", ""my pain is finally over"", ""I'm dead"". These are direct expressions of a desire for death.
    *   Emotional indicators: ""pain"" (implying suffering), ""happy"" (associated with death as an escape from pain).
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and finding relief in death (""when I die"", ""my pain is finally over"", ""I'm dead""). This clearly indicates suicidal expression.
    *   However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or any steps being taken towards self-harm or suicide.
    *   There is also no reference to past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   'indicator' is incorrect because there is explicit suicidal expression.
        *   'behavior' is incorrect because there is no plan or tendency to act out, nor historical self-harm.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""kill myself"", ""don't want to live"", ""goodbye"" (implying finality).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""don't care about anything anymore"", ""don't want to live"", ""life is all downhill"", ""ruined"", ""nothing in my life"" (hopelessness, despair, apathy, feeling of worthlessness).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I finally decided to take the leap"" (implies a decided action, potentially a method like jumping). ""goodbye"" is a common sign of preparation for a final act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No direct mention of past *attempts*. ""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"" suggests past suicidal ideation or struggle, but not a past *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I don't want to live"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""take the leap"" is a strong phrase indicating a decided action, often associated with a specific method like jumping, even if not explicitly stated.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? ""I finally decided"" indicates a firm decision has been made. ""goodbye"" is a very strong sign of preparation and finality.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post clearly states a *current decision* with *future intention*: ""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself."" The ""month longer"" refers to a past period of struggle, but the core of the post is about the present decision to act.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** Incorrect. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the phrases ""I finally decided to take the leap"" and ""goodbye"" go beyond mere thoughts or desires. They indicate a firm decision and signs of preparation/tendency to act.
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best. There is explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself""). There is a clear ""tendency to act out suicide"" (""I finally decided to take the leap"") and signs of ""plan or tendency to act out"" through the ""goodbye"" message and the decided nature of ""take the leap."" The phrase ""take the leap"" can be interpreted as a decided method, even if not fully detailed.
    *   **attempt:** Incorrect. The post describes a decision to act, not a recent or historical attempt.

The presence of a firm decision (""I finally decided"") and a clear sign of finality/preparation (""goodbye""), combined with the phrase ""take the leap"" which implies a decided action, moves this beyond ideation into the realm of a plan or strong tendency to act.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"", ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"", ""Goodbye"". These are all strong indicators of suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feel so relaxed that it's finally ending"" suggests a sense of peace or resolution about an imminent end, which can be a concerning sign.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all."" While not a method, this describes a *preparatory act* or a final ritual before the intended suicide. This implies a decision has been made and an action is imminent.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None explicitly mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Phrases like ""end it all"", ""call it quits"", ""it's finally ending"" directly convey suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""22 years on this earth was enough for me.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., specific tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all"" indicates a final, pre-suicide ritual or preparation. This suggests a *tendency to act out*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The phrasing ""before i end it all"" and ""it's finally ending"" indicates an imminent action.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post has explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by describing a specific preparatory act (""Playing my favourite video game one last time"") immediately preceding the stated intention to ""end it all."" This indicates a ""tendency to act out"" or a pre-suicide ritual, which aligns with the 'behavior' category. The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" The ""one last time"" ritual fits the ""tendency to act out"" aspect.

She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post mentions ""she had tried to kill herself"". This refers to a third party, not the poster.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I need help"", ""I'm scared"". These indicate the poster's distress and concern for someone else.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None for the poster.
   - References to past attempts: The post mentions ""she had tried to kill herself"", referring to a past attempt by a friend, not the poster.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, in relation to the friend.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the person writing the post. The poster is expressing concern for someone else.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the poster.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for the poster.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a past event involving a friend (""she had tried to kill herself three days ago"") and the poster's current concern about that friend's well-being. It does not refer to the poster's own past events or current/future intentions regarding suicide.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, for the friend.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The crucial rule is that the suicide risk *only* corresponds to the person writing the post.
   - The post clearly describes a suicide attempt by *another person* and the poster's fear and concern for that person.
   - The poster themselves does not express any suicidal ideation, plans, or past attempts. Their expressions (""I need help"", ""I'm scared"") are about seeking assistance regarding their friend's situation, not their own suicidal intent.
   - Therefore, based on the content *from the poster*, there is no explicit suicidal expression.

   - References to past attempts: ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"" indicates past self-harm behavior, but not explicitly a past *suicide* attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I will hang myself now"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I don't want to be alone anymore"", ""kill me"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself"", ""something that I can tie"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it"". This indicates active seeking of means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""I will hang myself now"", ""I'm now looking for""). Past self-harm is mentioned.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Past *self-harm* is described, but not past *suicide attempts*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I will hang myself now""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post goes beyond mere ideation by explicitly stating a present intention (""I will hang myself now"") and an active search for means (""I'm now looking for something that I can tie""). This indicates a clear plan and tendency to act.
   - The post mentions historical experience of self-harm (""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore"").
   - There is no explicit mention of a recent or historical *suicide attempt*.

   Therefore, the post fits the 'behavior' category, which requires explicit suicidal expression AND a plan/tendency to act OR mentioned historical experience of self-harm behavior. Both conditions are met.

This suggests a *tendency to act out* self-harm or suicide through destructive means.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I WANT TO DOIE"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicidal courage and determination"", ""suicide"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I WANT TO DOIE"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, methods for causing destruction that are presented as the poster's way of ""going out with a bang"" if they decide to ""do it"" (commit suicide): ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"", ""make nitroglycerin at home"", targeting ""biggest power plants"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home"", ""research where to find the parts for cheap"", ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best"". These are preparatory steps for the described destructive acts, which are linked to the poster's suicidal ideation and desire for a dramatic end.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""I WANT TO DOIE"", ""If you change your mind and you want to do it"", ""You will never do it so calm down"", ""Learn how to make"", ""research where to find"", ""Take a vacation"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I WANT TO DOIE"", ""suicidal thoughts""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because it describes not only a desire to die but also specific, detailed methods and preparatory steps for a destructive act that the poster frames as their way of ""going out with a bang"" if they ""want to do it"" (commit suicide). The phrase ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" in the 'behavior' definition is key here. While the methods are for external mayhem, they are presented as the *manner* of the poster's potential suicide, indicating a plan or strong tendency to act.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
    *   The detailed description of methods and preparatory steps for a destructive act, explicitly linked to the poster's own ""doing it"" (suicide), fits the 'behavior' category.

122,"Bully payback help. My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn't even know. Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!. With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself"" is mentioned, but it is explicitly stated as something the *bully told the friend*, not an expression from the person writing the post.
   - Emotional indicators: The post describes the *friend* as ""mentally disturbing"", ""constantly tired"", ""overwhelmed"", and ""not doing well"". These describe the friend's state, not the poster's. The poster expresses a desire for ""payback"" and ""justice"" for their friend.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned by the poster regarding themselves.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned by the poster regarding themselves.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, as a quote from the bully to the friend. It is not an explicit suicidal expression from the person writing the post.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the person writing the post.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not by the poster regarding themselves.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes an ongoing bullying situation affecting the friend. The poster's intention is to seek help/justice for the friend. There are no past or current/future suicidal intentions expressed by the *poster*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post is entirely focused on the distress of the *friend* and the *poster's* desire to help the friend and get ""justice"" against the bully.
   - The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".
   - There is no explicit suicidal expression from the person writing the post. The mention of ""kill yourself"" is a quote of what the bully said to the friend.
   - Therefore, the post does not indicate suicidal risk for the person writing it.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation are mentioned (e.g., acquiring materials), but the strong desire for a specific method indicates a clear tendency.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"", ""suicide is on my mind everyday"").
    *   It also explicitly mentions a specific method (""I want to hang myself so bad"") and a strong desire to act on it, which falls under ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, the 'behavior' category, which includes explicit suicidal expression and a plan or tendency to act out, is the most appropriate fit.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""still alive unfortunately"", ""I attempted once again"", ""still want to attempt again"", ""suicide attempt"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""unfortunately"" indicates a desire not to be alive.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

It refers to a very recent past event (""last night I attempted once again""), a historical pattern of past attempts (""this makes it like what my 15th time?""), and a current desire/intention (""still want to attempt again"") which is then stated to be put on hold (""but I found one thing to live for so I guess ill stay alive"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states ""last night I attempted once again"" and ""this makes it like what my 15th time?"".
    *   The definition for 'attempt' is: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
    *   This post directly describes both a recent suicide attempt and a history of multiple suicide attempts.
    *   While there's a mention of current ideation (""still want to attempt again"") and a reason to live, the primary and most definitive information provided is the recent and historical *attempts*.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I'm at the end of my rope right now."" (idiom for despair), ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through."" (implies a life-ending action that was not completed this time), ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" (strong implication of past actions leading to unconsciousness, consistent with non-fatal self-harm or suicide attempts), ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" (explicit desire for death).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Everything's crumbling"", ""I don't see a reason as for why"", ""scared"", ""sad"", ""alone"", ""can't reach out"". High levels of hopelessness, despair, fear, and isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method is mentioned. ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting"" describes physical sensations, possibly related to an ongoing action, but not a future plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through."" implies a current or very recent action that was not completed. Crucially, ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" explicitly states a historical experience of an action that leads to unconsciousness but not death.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up."" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. ""I'm still too scared to go all the way through"" also implies a desire to end life, but fear prevents completion.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post describes a current state of distress and physical sensations (""I'm at the end of my rope right now,"" ""I feel my breath slowing down, my chest is hurting"").
    *   It refers to a current uncompleted action (""I'm still too scared to go all the way through"").
    *   It explicitly mentions a *historical experience*: ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up."" This indicates past actions that led to unconsciousness but not death.
    *   It expresses a future desire: ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression (""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"") and mention of past actions.
    *   **ideation:** Ruled out because there is more than just explicit suicidal expression; there's a clear reference to past actions and current physical sensations related to a potential action.
    *   **behavior:** The definition includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post has explicit suicidal expression and a tendency to act (""I'm still too scared to go all the way through""). It also mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" with ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up.""
    *   **attempt:** The definition includes ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The key phrase ""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up"" strongly indicates a *historical experience of suicide attempt* (non-fatal, as the person wakes up). The context of ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up"" reinforces that the underlying intent is related to death, making the past actions more likely attempts than just general self-harm behavior. While the current action is uncompleted (""still too scared to go all the way through""), the definite mention of *past* non-fatal actions (""as I've done this before"") aligns perfectly with the ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"" criterion for the 'attempt' category.

The most fitting category is 'attempt' due to the explicit mention of historical experiences that align with non-fatal suicide attempts, supported by the desire for death.

   - 'indicator': Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression and a clear plan.
   - 'ideation': Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression *and* a clear plan/tendency to act.
   - 'behavior': This category fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I am going to shoot myself"") and clearly outlines a plan (""writing this with a loaded gun by my side"") and a strong tendency to act out suicide (""I am not giving myself anymore chances... I am going to shoot myself""). The preparations mentioned (""Every other account is gone, deleted"", ""no more savings, my room is empty, everything is gone"") further support a strong tendency to act. While it mentions past intent but no past attempt, the current situation describes an imminent plan.
   - 'attempt': Incorrect. The post describes an *imminent plan and preparation* for an act, not a *recent suicide attempt* that has already occurred or a historical experience of a suicide attempt. The phrasing ""not sure what will happen once I post this. I could die, or the attempt could fail."" indicates the act is about to happen, not that it has already happened.

The user states ""if it doesn't [help], I'll be back in the same spot or worse off than before and my end will only get nearer. I'm fine with either outcome.""

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""tonight i stole..."" and ""ive had a bit to drink tonight"" refer to very recent/current self-harming actions. ""i havent felt ok in a while and im not sure what to do"" refers to ongoing distress.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** This category is for posts with no explicit suicidal expression *or* resolved issues. While there's no explicit suicidal expression, the post describes concrete self-harming *behavior*, which goes beyond just an ""indicator"" of distress.
    *   **ideation:** This category requires explicit suicidal expression, which is not present.
    *   **attempt:** This category requires explicit expression of a recent or historical suicide attempt. The post describes self-harming behavior but does not state it was a suicide attempt (""just to feel ok"").
    *   **behavior:** The definition states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or* mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While there is no explicit suicidal expression, the post clearly describes a ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (the misuse of hydrocodone and alcohol ""tonight""). This action, even if not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt, is a dangerous self-harming behavior taken to cope with distress.

    Therefore, the post fits the 'behavior' category due to the explicit description of recent self-harming actions (misuse of hydrocodone and alcohol) to cope with distress.

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""might not wake up tomorrow"" directly implies death. ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a clear description of self-harm/suicidal action.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""fucked up I am,"" ""unfair on them,"" ""guilty,"" ""sorry"" indicate distress, self-blame, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""taken a fuck load of pills"" explicitly states the method and implies the action has been taken.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a very recent or ongoing action, not a past attempt from a more distant history, but rather an immediate one.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""might not wake up tomorrow"" is a direct expression of the potential outcome of not being alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""taken a fuck load of pills.""
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The act of taking pills implies prior acquisition, which is a form of preparation, but more importantly, it describes the *execution* of the method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""taken a fuck load of pills"" uses the past participle, strongly indicating an action that has just occurred or is currently in progress. ""might not wake up tomorrow"" refers to the immediate future consequence of this action. This is a description of a recent/ongoing event.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** It describes a *recent* action that constitutes an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly describes a specific action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") that is intended to cause death (""might not wake up tomorrow""). This is not mere ideation (thoughts of suicide) or general self-harm behavior without a clear suicidal intent (though it is self-harm with suicidal intent). The phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" directly expresses a recent suicide attempt.
    *   Comparing with definitions:
        *   'indicator': Ruled out due to explicit suicidal action.
        *   'ideation': Ruled out because there's an action, not just thoughts.
        *   'behavior': While ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a behavior, the specific phrasing ""might not wake up tomorrow"" combined with the action makes it a clear *attempt* rather than just a general self-harm behavior or a plan not yet acted upon. The definition for 'behavior' mentions ""plan or tendency to act out...or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" This post describes a *recent* action with a clear suicidal outcome.
        *   'attempt': ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This perfectly matches ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow,"" which is an explicit expression concerning a recent suicide attempt.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, substance) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""planning out my suicide"" and setting a specific timeline (""January 1st"") are clear signs of preparation and a concrete plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

It refers to both: a past failed attempt (""fear of failing an attempt once again"") and strong current/future intentions and planning (""I'm planning out my suicide"", ""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st"", ""I will go through with this"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It clearly outlines a *plan* for suicide (""planning out my suicide"") and a *tendency to act out* (""intention in the beginning of the new year, come January 1st"", ""I will go through with this"").
    *   It also mentions a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" (""fear of failing an attempt once again"").
    *   The 'behavior' category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" This post fits perfectly, as it has both a current plan/tendency and a mentioned historical attempt (which is a form of self-harm behavior).
    *   While 'attempt' also covers historical attempts, the dominant element here is the *current planning and intent* for a future suicide, which falls under the 'plan or tendency to act out' part of the 'behavior' definition. The past attempt serves as context for the current, active planning.

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for.

   - The post explicitly mentions ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" (""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor""). This directly matches the definition of the 'attempt' category: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" While there is also current ideation, the presence of described past attempts is the defining factor for the 'attempt' category.

Living is just so frustrating for someone like me, it doesn't help that i'm sensitive af and that my relationship with my mom sucks. To top it all off I have been doing nothing for the past year dropped out of college because I was burned out and quite my parttime job.

I might actually get the courage to do it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Living is not for me"", ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old"", ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"", ""I might actually get the courage to do it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""frustrating"", ""crippling anxiety"", ""sensitive af"", ""burned out"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., tool, location) or signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post states ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old,"" which indicates a past desire or thought, but explicitly implies the difficulty prevented an attempt. It does not describe a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Living is not for me"", ""I would have been gone"", ""I might actually get the courage to do it"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past desires (""when I was 15""), current feelings of frustration and increasing confidence, and future intentions/potential actions (""I might actually get the courage to do it"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"", ""suicide"").
    *   There is no specific plan or method outlined.
    *   However, the statements ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"" and ""I might actually get the courage to do it"" strongly indicate a *tendency to act out* or a progression towards acting on suicidal thoughts, even without a concrete plan. This goes beyond mere ideation, suggesting a growing likelihood of action.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, nor historical self-harm *behavior*.
    *   Comparing 'ideation' (""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"") with 'behavior' (""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide""), the ""tendency to act out"" component aligns with the post's content.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""be dead in less than 24 hours"", ""the pain is too much"", ""if you wanted to die you would"" (implies suicidal thoughts).
   - Emotional indicators: ""Too much"", ""the pain is too much"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours"". This indicates a specific method (Trazodone + alcohol) and a clear timeline/intention to act.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past *attempts*. The phrase about hiding it better suggests past suicidal thoughts or ideation, but not attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""be dead in less than 24 hours"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Trazodone and alcohol"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today"" indicates acquiring or having the means and planning to acquire the other.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""be dead in less than 24 hours"").
   - It clearly outlines a specific plan (""Trazodone and alcohol"") and a clear intention/tendency to act on that plan within a short timeframe (""will get alcohol today and be dead in less than 24 hours"").
   - This aligns with the definition of 'behavior': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". It is not 'ideation' because a plan and tendency to act are present. It is not 'attempt' as it describes a future action, not a past or recent attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I want to give up"", ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"", ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" These phrases express a desire to cease existing or a profound sense of worthlessness that can precede suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired of my obsessive negative thoughts"", ""struggling since I was a child"", ""so long since I've been happy"", ""Nothing makes sense anymore"", ""I feel guilty for feeling this way"", ""bringing myself pain"", ""I bring nothing to the table. Absolutely nothing."" -> Strong indicators of chronic depression, hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and anhedonia.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to give up"" directly expresses a desire to cease effort/existence. ""Why the fuck am I alive and existing in people's lives?"" and ""My life has no worth. No meaning."" are strong expressions of suicidal ideation and existential despair.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a long-standing struggle (""Every year"", ""since I was a child"") but the desire to ""give up"" and the questioning of existence (""Why am I alive"") are current feelings and intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to give up and questioning the value of one's life/existence, which falls under ""explicit suicidal expression"".
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or any tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. There are also no mentions of past *behavior* or *attempts*.
   - Therefore, the content aligns best with ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Maybe cushion the pain idk."" (shows some consideration for others, but the primary focus is on self-inflicted death).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have anorexia and I currently weigh 90 pounds, but my new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me."" This clearly outlines a method (starvation/anorexia) and a specific target/plan (reaching a lethal weight).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit past attempts are mentioned, but the current state of anorexia is framed as an ongoing, deliberate path to death.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""anorexia"" with a ""new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me."" This is a clear, specific method (starvation) and a target.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The setting of a ""new goal weight"" with the explicit purpose of death indicates a deliberate plan and ongoing action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** This refers to current and future intentions. ""I'm going to let myself pass away"", ""my new goal weight is..."", ""I might have to go lower..."", ""it will give people plenty of time to adjust"". This is an active, ongoing process with a lethal future goal.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No, but the current anorexia is described as the chosen method for a slow suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': Incorrect, there is explicit suicidal expression and a plan.
    *   'ideation': Incorrect, there is not only explicit suicidal expression but also a clear plan and tendency to act out self-harm/suicide.
    *   'behavior': This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post clearly has explicit suicidal expression (""kill me"", ""slowly kill myself""). It also describes a specific plan (""new goal weight is 78 pounds, but I might have to go lower for it to finally kill me"") and an ongoing tendency to act out self-harm/suicide through anorexia. This fits perfectly.
    *   'attempt': Incorrect, the post describes a future-oriented plan and ongoing self-harm, not a recent or historical *attempt*.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: Not directly stated, but the question implies a serious consideration of suicide.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific method being inquired about as a means for suicide. This indicates an exploration of means.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression of wanting to die, but a direct question about the possibility of suicide using a specific method, which constitutes explicit suicidal expression.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""charcoal bbq in a tent"". This is a specific method for carbon monoxide poisoning.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No direct signs of preparation, but the inquiry about the *possibility* and effectiveness of a specific method suggests active consideration and exploration of a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current inquiry about a future or potential action.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicide"").
   - Crucially, it goes beyond mere ideation by inquiring about the feasibility of a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent""). This indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" as it's an active investigation into how to commit suicide, rather than just a general thought of wanting to die. It's not an attempt, nor is it resolved. It's more than just ideation because of the specific method inquiry.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**
        *   ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. But I can't do it anymore."" - Implies a time limit before giving up on life.
        *   ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down."" - Uses a metaphor of a sick dog needing to be 'put down', which is a clear euphemism for ending one's life.
        *   ""It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down."" - Directly links the 'putting down' metaphor to self-action.
        *   ""Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human?"" - Further reinforces the application of the 'putting down' metaphor to a human (themselves).
        *   ""Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me?"" - Expresses a desire for self-harm/victimization, indicating profound self-destructive thoughts, though not directly suicidal.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Nothing's real to me anymore,"" ""I can't find a way to release,"" ""I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything.""), exhaustion (""Im tired of them yelling, and fighting""), self-loathing (""I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me."").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) for suicide is mentioned. The ""3 weeks"" is a deadline, not a method or plan of action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used. However, the repeated metaphorical expression ""put down"" in reference to oneself is a strong, explicit euphemism for suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't do it anymore"" combined with the ""put down"" metaphor strongly conveys a desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""3 weeks"" refers to a future deadline. The feelings of being unable to continue and the metaphorical desire to be ""put down"" refer to current feelings and potential future actions if the situation doesn't improve.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression through the ""put down"" metaphor and direct statements of being unable to continue. This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no concrete plan or specific method for suicide described (e.g., how they would ""put themselves down""). The ""3 weeks"" is a conditional period, not a plan of action.
    *   There is no mention of a historical suicide attempt.
    *   While there are self-destructive thoughts (""why do I want horrible things to happen to me""), these are ideations, not descriptions of past self-harm *behavior* by the poster. The category 'behavior' requires a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" or ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post describes the *desire* to be ""put down"" if things don't improve, but not a concrete plan or active steps towards acting out.

    Therefore, the post fits 'ideation' because it has explicit suicidal expression but lacks a specific plan or active tendency to commit suicide, and does not describe past suicide attempts or self-harm behavior.

Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months."" ""Yesterday, I drafted my will."" Mentions considerations for methods (""would never use a weapon from my household,"" ""wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained"").
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. The ""plotting"" and ""will drafting"" are preparations for a potential future act, not descriptions of a past attempt. ""when they back off the proverbial cliff"" implies *not* acting on the thoughts/plans.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation,"" ""plotting my suicide seriously,"" ""I just can't 'click' into life."" While the post ends with ""I don't think I would do 'it',"" the preceding content describes serious, persistent suicidal ideation and preparations.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not explicitly, but considerations are mentioned (""would never use a weapon from my household,"" ""wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""drafted my will"" and ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions and ongoing cyclical thoughts/preparations. ""plotting... on and off for months"" is ongoing. ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" is a recent preparation. The post describes a recurring pattern of serious suicidal thoughts and preparations, even if the individual is currently feeling better (""Today, I feel better,"" ""I am out of my hole for now"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out. There is explicit suicidal expression and serious, ongoing preparations, not resolved issues.
    *   **ideation:** Ruled out. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the category definition states ""there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This post clearly describes a ""plan or tendency"" through ""plotting my suicide seriously"" and ""drafted my will.""
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best. It includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   Explicit suicidal expression: Yes.
        *   Plan or tendency to act out suicide: Yes. ""Plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months"" and ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" are strong indicators of a plan or tendency to act, even if the person is currently feeling better. These are concrete preparatory steps beyond mere thoughts.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out. There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. The individual explicitly states they ""back off the proverbial cliff"" and are currently ""out of my hole.""

The presence of serious plotting and drafting a will elevates this beyond mere ideation to a level of preparatory behavior, even with fluctuating intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is present. This implies a feeling of being a burden or that their absence would benefit others, which can be a component of suicidal ideation, but it's not an explicit statement of wanting to die or commit suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i hate tough love,"" ""stressed,"" ""not in a good mood,"" ""brings me anxiety,"" ""sick of this endless myopic bouts of 'criticism',"" ""feeling depressed,"" ""abused enough at home,"" ""i want it to stop,"" ""if i leave them i have no one."" These indicate significant emotional distress, hopelessness, feelings of being overwhelmed, and social isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is an indirect expression of feeling like a burden, not an explicit statement of suicidal intent or desire to die.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The post does not contain phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I wasn't alive,"" or ""I'm going to kill myself.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current feelings and reactions to recent events (""today Z started mocking me""). The desire for things to stop (""i want it to stop"") is a current feeling.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses profound emotional distress, feelings of being a burden, abuse, anxiety, depression, and social isolation. These are significant risk factors and emotional indicators often associated with suicidal thoughts.
    *   However, the definition for 'ideation' requires ""explicit suicidal expression."" The phrase ""i feel like he would be better off without me"" is an *implication* or *indirect expression* of feeling like a burden, rather than an *explicit* statement of wanting to die or commit suicide. It doesn't directly state ""I want to die"" or ""I am thinking of suicide.""
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal expression, and no mention of plans, methods, or past attempts, the post best fits the 'indicator' category. It indicates significant distress and potential risk factors, but not explicit suicidal thoughts or actions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" ""dying,"" or ""self-harm."" The phrase ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"" is directed at another person and expresses a wish for that person to be absent or quiet, not a wish for the poster's own death or suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme anger, rage, frustration (""FUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCFFFKKKKKKKK YOUUUUU"", ""FUCK YOU""), profound exhaustion and despair (""i'm so tired"", ""she has sucked my soul out dry, i have no more energy to deal with this anymore"", ""the world is just fucked in every single way"", ""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED""). Feelings of abandonment (""JUST TO ABANDON THEM ON TOP OF THAT?"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past traumatic events (""why did you this? why us? why didn't you tell my dad what they did? how can you do those sorts of things to a child."") and current overwhelming emotional distress. There are no future intentions related to self-harm or suicide.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post is filled with intense negative emotions (anger, despair, exhaustion) and references to past trauma and current overwhelming circumstances.
    *   However, there is *no explicit mention* of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, or any plans/methods related to these. The despair is existential and related to the state of the world and personal suffering, but it does not manifest as a direct suicidal statement from the poster.
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   'attempt' requires explicit expression of recent or historical suicide attempt. Not present.
        *   'behavior' requires explicit suicidal expression AND a plan/tendency to act out self-harm/suicide, or historical self-harm. Not present.
        *   'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression but no plan. Not present.
        *   'indicator' states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This post clearly falls under ""no explicit suicidal expression."" While it shows severe distress, it doesn't cross the threshold into explicit suicidal language.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""I don't want to kill myself, but."" This directly mentions suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""literally nothing going for me,"" ""pushed all my friends away,"" ""barely leave the house anymore,"" ""sick of sitting inside all day,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""so stagnant for so long,"" ""sick of this,"" ""world rejects me at every turn,"" ""don't know what's next for me,"" ""walls are closing in and there's no escape."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, stagnation, and feeling trapped.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I don't want to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post explicitly states ""I don't want to kill myself"" and ""I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life."" However, the ""but"" after the negation, followed by expressions of feeling trapped and hopeless (""walls are closing in and there's no escape,"" ""nothing is going to change""), suggests that the *idea* of suicide is present, even if currently resisted.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings of despair and future anxieties (""nothing is going to change,"" ""don't know what's next for me""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Not applicable. There is explicit suicidal expression, and the issues are not resolved.
   - 'ideation': This fits. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I don't want to kill myself, but..."") and strong indicators of despair and feeling trapped, suggesting the presence of suicidal thoughts or the *idea* of suicide, even if not a direct desire to die. There is no plan or tendency to commit suicide mentioned.
   - 'behavior': Not applicable. There is no plan or tendency to act out self-harm/suicide, nor any mention of historical self-harm behavior.
   - 'attempt': Not applicable. There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly mentions suicide, expresses significant distress and hopelessness, but lacks any specific plan or indication of immediate intent to act.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, a specific timeframe (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") and a potential preparatory action (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out""). This indicates a tendency or a step towards acting out, even if the method is not detailed. The phrase ""try and go out"" in this context implies a final action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and future intentions (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I probably will hit up everyone"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"").
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a *timeframe* (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") and describing a *tendency/preparatory action* (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out""). This indicates a move towards acting out, even with stated hesitation.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""dead inside"", ""useless life"", ""yeet myself way too much"" (colloquial for self-harm/suicide).
    *   Emotional indicators: ""huge depressive episode"", ""still sad"", ""still anhedonic"", ""beyond saving"", ""want to cry"".
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""yeet myself"" implies a method, though not highly specific. No signs of preparation.
    *   References to past attempts: No direct mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through ""yeet myself way too much"", which is a strong colloquial expression for self-harm or suicide.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""useless life"", ""still dead inside"", and the strong urge to ""yeet myself"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? ""yeet myself"" implies a physical act of self-harm or suicide, but a specific tool, location, or substance is not detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" refers to a current strong urge or intention. The ""huge depressive episode"" is past, but its effects are current (""still dead inside"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   'indicator': Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   'ideation': This category implies explicit suicidal expression *without* a plan or tendency to commit suicide. The phrase ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much"" expresses a strong *tendency* or urge to act out self-harm/suicide, moving beyond mere thoughts.
    *   'behavior': This category includes explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan or *tendency to act out* self-harm or suicide. The strong desire and urge (""I just want to... yeet myself way too much"") to perform the action (""yeet myself"") fits the ""tendency to act out"" criterion.
    *   'attempt': Ruled out as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the strong expression of a current urge/tendency to act (""yeet myself way too much""), the post best fits the 'behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded."" (""end it"" is a common euphemism for suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: ""i fucked up this time"", ""God im such a fucking loser"", ""hopelessness"" (due to potential loss of license, job, independence), ""despair"" (feeling like things always go wrong).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned for current intent.
   - References to past attempts: ""I tried to end it once before.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, indirectly through ""end it"" and ""wish I succeeded"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" (in ending it).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post describes current distress and potential future negative outcomes (""might lose my license"", ""might have to move back home"").
   - The suicidal expression refers to a past event (""I tried to end it once before"") and a current wish related to that past event (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded""). This clearly indicates a historical experience of a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I tried to end it once before."" This directly matches the definition for the 'attempt' category: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, *or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*."" The accompanying ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" reinforces the lingering connection to that past attempt and current suicidal ideation, but the defining factor is the clear mention of a past attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""give up and just get it over with"" (implies ending life), ""why keep going?"" (implies not wanting to continue living).
   - Emotional indicators: ""screaming at me"", ""defeated"", ""torture cycle"". These indicate extreme distress, hopelessness, and despair.

   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die or end suffering (""give up and just get it over with"", ""why keep going?""). This means it's not 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or historical self-harm/suicide *behavior*. This rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.

I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""attempting suicide"" multiple times (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"", ""I was so close to attempting suicide"").
   - Emotional indicators: ""regretting it immensely"", ""not mentally stable enough"", ""mortifying and embarrassing"", ""want to rip my hair out"", ""feel nauseous"", ""dreading this"", ""cannot stand living with my family"". These show significant distress, shame, and discomfort.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans or methods for a *current or future* suicide are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: The phrases ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" indicate a very strong past intention or proximity to a suicide attempt that was averted. It does not state a completed attempt, but rather being on the verge of one.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""attempting suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct ""I want to die"" statement, but the choice presented (""either that or going through with attempting suicide"") implies a past state where wanting to die was a strong consideration.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post describes *averting* an attempt by reaching out.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The suicidal content refers to a *past* state (""I was so close to attempting suicide but...""). The current situation (moving home) is a direct consequence of averting that past suicidal crisis. There is no indication of current or future suicidal intent or plan. The distress is about the consequences of revealing the struggle, not ongoing suicidal ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - **indicator**: This category is for no explicit suicidal expression or *explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues*. While the immediate crisis was resolved by reaching out, the explicit mention of being ""so close to attempting suicide"" is a very strong historical reference, which might push it beyond a simple 'resolved' status, especially given the severity of the past state.
   - **ideation**: This category is for explicit suicidal expression but *no plan or tendency to commit suicide*. The post *does* describe a past tendency (""so close to attempting suicide"").
   - **behavior**: This category is for explicit suicidal expression and a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*. The post clearly has explicit suicidal expression. The phrase ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" constitutes a ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (being on the verge of a suicidal act). While not a completed attempt, it describes a past state where the individual was at the behavioral stage, actively considering and nearing the act.
   - **attempt**: This category requires explicit expression concerning a *recent suicide attempt* or *mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*. The post explicitly states ""so close to attempting"" not ""attempted"". Therefore, it does not fit the 'attempt' category.

   Given the explicit mention of being ""so close to attempting suicide"" as a past event, it fits best under 'behavior' due to the ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" clause. It describes a past state that was beyond mere ideation and was at the brink of action.

161,I cant take it. I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity. Its excruciating,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I wont kill myself of course"" explicitly denies suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it"", ""the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity"", ""Its excruciating"" indicate extreme emotional distress, pain, and frustration.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plans for suicide. The desire to ""scream and break everything"" indicates a tendency to act out due to distress, but not self-harm or suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""kill myself"" is used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the statement ""I wont kill myself of course"" is a direct *negation* of wanting to die or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No methods for suicide are mentioned. Methods for expressing distress (""scream and break everything"") are mentioned, but these are not suicidal.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a current emotional state and a current/future intention to *not* commit suicide.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit emotional distress but directly states ""I wont kill myself of course,"" which is a clear negation of suicidal expression.
   - According to the definitions, 'indicator' includes posts with ""no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" The explicit denial of suicide (""I wont kill myself"") falls under the ""no explicit suicidal expression"" (as the mention is immediately negated) or could be interpreted as a ""resolved"" issue for the time being.
   - It does not fit 'ideation' because there is no explicit suicidal expression (it's negated).
   - It does not fit 'behavior' or 'attempt' as there are no plans, tendencies to self-harm/suicide, or mentions of past attempts.

162,I wish I could stop obsessing over appearance. All the females around me want to become prettier which has only intensified my gender dysphoria. I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing. I want to be a male now.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): ""obsessing"", ""intensified my gender dysphoria"", ""hate"". These indicate significant distress and discomfort with gender identity/expression.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire for gender affirmation (""I want to be a male now"") and distress over current circumstances, but not a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and desires (""I wish I could stop..."", ""I want to be a male now""). There is no mention of past suicidal events or attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, there is no explicit suicidal expression, no mention of wanting to die, no plans, and no history of attempts. The post conveys significant emotional distress related to gender dysphoria but does not cross into explicit suicidal ideation or behavior. Therefore, it fits the 'indicator' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I wish I had the courage to end it all.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""absolutely hate myself,"" ""loathe my existence,"" ""Today was another day. A bad one.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

Because deep down I know this actually is probably true,"" ""you are loved, you are seen,"" ""Stay around to see these days, the good, the bad. There's more to come.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""wish I had the courage to end it all.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""wish I had the courage to end it all."" However, this is immediately followed by a desire to endure and a message of hope.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The initial statement ""wish I had the courage to end it all"" refers to a current feeling. However, the overwhelming majority of the post then shifts to current and future intentions of *enduring*, *staying*, and offering *support* to others, indicating a resolution or a strong desire to overcome the initial suicidal thought. There are no past attempts described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post *begins* with an explicit suicidal expression (""wish I had the courage to end it all""). This might initially suggest 'ideation'.
    *   However, the definition of 'indicator' includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" The post immediately pivots from the suicidal thought to a strong desire to endure (""I just want the courage to endure it all""), a belief that things can get better (""deep down I know this actually is probably true""), and a powerful message of hope and support for others (""you aren't alone,"" ""here I stay. waiting,"" ""you are loved, you are seen,"" ""Stay around to see these days"").
    *   The overall message of the post is one of overcoming suicidal feelings and enduring, actively encouraging both the author and others to stay and find hope. This clearly demonstrates a resolution of the suicidal issue, or at least a strong commitment to resolving it and enduring.
    *   There is no plan or tendency to act, nor any mention of past self-harm or attempts. Therefore, 'behavior' and 'attempt' are ruled out.
    *   While 'ideation' involves explicit suicidal expression, this post goes beyond mere expression by actively demonstrating a shift towards resolution and endurance. The core message is one of overcoming and offering hope, aligning with the ""resolved suicidal issues"" aspect of 'indicator'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""wouldn't be alive right now"", ""almost committed suicide"", ""still consider [suicide]"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""anxiety has gotten much more severe"", ""interfering with almost everything I do"", ""really sick of my family"", ""no friends at school"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Explicitly states ""didn't have anything to do it with"", meaning no specific method was available or used. No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""a few days ago I almost committed suicide"". This is a direct reference to a very recent, aborted attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""a few days ago I almost committed suicide"" describes a past, aborted suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression and refers to a recent event where the individual ""almost committed suicide."" This indicates a strong intent and action that was only prevented by a lack of means.
    *   The 'attempt' category is defined as ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The phrase ""a few days ago I almost committed suicide"" directly fits the description of a recent or historical suicide attempt, even if it was aborted due to external factors (lack of means). This is more than just ideation or a general tendency; it describes an action that was initiated with suicidal intent.

    *   **References to past attempts:** The act of ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"" is a direct engagement with a suicidal method and constitutes a self-harm behavior, even if stopped.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the individual actively engaged with the method by ""put[ting] the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"". This is a direct physical action towards suicide, even if described as practice and stopped.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

It refers to current intense suicidal ideation (""I really want to hang myself right now"", ""I can't stop thinking about killing myself"", ""I can't focus on anything except trying again"", ""I don't feel like I can wait any longer"") and a very recent, specific self-harm *behavior* (""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond mere 'ideation' because there is not just explicit suicidal expression and thoughts, but also a concrete *action* taken towards self-harm/suicide (""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"").
    *   This action fits the description of 'behavior' which includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*."" The described action is a direct self-harm behavior.
    *   It is not an 'attempt' because the post explicitly states the action was stopped (""I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU""). An attempt typically implies an action carried out with intent to die that results in self-injury or requires medical intervention, even if unsuccessful. This was a preparatory or self-harm behavior that was halted before reaching that stage.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions. The language ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I'm finally ready to do it,"" and ""It's finally fucking time"" all point to an immediate or very near-future intention.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""violently suicidal"", ""I just want to fucking die"").
   - It mentions a specific method (""get a gun"").
   - It expresses a strong, immediate tendency and intention to act (""I'm finally doing it"", ""I think I know that I'm going to go through with it"").
   - There is no mention of a *recent* or *historical* suicide attempt, which rules out 'attempt'.
   - The presence of a specific method and a strong tendency to act out differentiates it from 'ideation', which implies no plan or tendency.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category as it includes explicit suicidal expression, a plan/method, and a clear tendency to act out.

There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm**: ""end things"" (euphemism for suicide), ""doesn't want me dead"", ""at the edge"" (implies being on the verge of suicide).
    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""apathetic about my existing"", ""want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"" (desire for escape, numbness, hopelessness), ""pathetic?"" (self-doubt, seeking validation).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: ""just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"". This indicates a specific location (mountains) and a clear intention to use that location for suicide. Driving there with this intent is a preparatory action.
    *   **References to past attempts**: No explicit mention of past attempts. However, there is a description of a very recent action taken with suicidal intent.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, through euphemisms like ""end things"" and contextual phrases like ""at the edge"" and ""doesn't want me dead.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, the phrase ""with full intentions to end things"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent. The desire to ""sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"" also reflects a desire to escape current suffering, often associated with not wanting to be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** A location (""mountains"") is mentioned with the intention to ""end things"" there. While not a specific tool (e.g., gun, pills), driving to a specific location *with full intentions to end things* implies a plan related to that location (e.g., jumping, exposure).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" is a clear sign of preparation and action taken towards a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""just finished driving up to the mountains"" refers to a very recent past action taken with a current/recent suicidal intention. The phrase ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" indicates a current wavering or de-escalation, but the *action* of driving there with intent was just completed.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No, but a recent *action taken with suicidal intent* is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   **indicator**: Ruled out. There is explicit suicidal expression and action taken.
    *   **ideation**: Ruled out. This is more than just an idea; there was a specific plan (location) and an action taken (""driving up... with full intentions"").
    *   **behavior**: This fits. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""end things,"" ""doesn't want me dead"") and describes a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through the action of ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things."" This is a concrete step taken towards a suicidal plan, even if the final act was not completed. It demonstrates a clear ""tendency to act out.""
    *   **attempt**: Ruled out. The post explicitly states, ""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" indicating that a full attempt was not made. The action described is preparatory behavior, not a failed or interrupted attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""I'm ready to die"", ""go out the way I want"", ""ready to go"". These are strong expressions of suicidal intent.

While a specific *method* isn't named, the existence of a set date, ongoing preparations, and a feeling of being ""strapped in and ready to go"" clearly indicate a plan and readiness to act.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the phrases ""I'm ready to die"", ""go out the way I want"", and ""ready to go"" are explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm ready to die"", ""ready to go"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, substance, location) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, very strong signs: ""The date was set a while ago"", ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"". This indicates active preparation and imminent intent.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions (""I'm ready to die"", ""Preps being made"", ""ready to go""). ""The date was set a while ago"" indicates a pre-existing plan that is now being acted upon or is imminent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression (""I'm ready to die"", ""ready to go"").
   - It clearly indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through mentions of a ""date was set"", ""Preps being made"", and being ""strapped in and ready to go"". This goes beyond mere ideation and points to active preparation and readiness for an action.
   - It does not describe a *recent* or *historical* suicide attempt, but rather a current state of readiness for one.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category as it covers explicit suicidal expression combined with a plan or tendency to act.

171,its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up"" are direct expressions of a wish for death or not to be alive. ""its working!"" implies an action is underway that is intended to achieve this outcome.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, hopelessness (implied by the desire not to wake up).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method is named, but ""its working!"" indicates that a method *is currently being executed* or has just been initiated and is having an effect. This suggests an active step towards self-harm/suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up"" are direct expressions of wanting to die/not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method is detailed.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** ""its working!"" is a strong sign that an action has been taken or is in progress, which is a form of preparation/execution.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""its working!"" refers to a current, ongoing action. ""hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up"" refers to the immediate desired future outcome of this current action.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Not 'indicator' because there is explicit suicidal expression and an active action implied.
    *   **ideation:** Not 'ideation' because ""its working!"" goes beyond mere expression of suicidal thoughts; it strongly suggests an action is being taken or has just been taken.
    *   **behavior:** 'behavior' involves ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". While ""its working!"" implies an action, it suggests more than just a *tendency* or *plan*. It indicates the action is *in progress* or *just initiated* and having an effect.
    *   **attempt:** 'attempt' involves ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt"". The phrase ""its working!"" combined with the desire not to wake up strongly implies that an action intended to end life has been initiated and is currently having its effect. This is an expression concerning a recent or ongoing suicide attempt. It's not just a plan or tendency, but a description of the immediate outcome of an action taken.

This post describes an active process (""its working!"") that is intended to lead to death (""last post"", ""never wake up""). This goes beyond planning or tendency and points to an action that is currently underway or has just been completed, fitting the description of an ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt.""

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrases ""I really want to check out,"" ""how much I want to check out,"" ""moral problem with suicide,"" ""unexpectedly checking out,"" and ""go out this way"" are all euphemisms or direct mentions of suicide/dying.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself""
   - Emotional indicators: ""stupid"", ""a lot of stress right now"", ""it would just be a lot easier"", ""never really seen myself going anywhere in life"", ""why not"" (indicating hopelessness, despair, feeling overwhelmed, rationalization of suicide).

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation because the user is actively seeking information on *how* to commit suicide (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?""). This indicates a ""tendency to act out"" or a search for a ""plan"" to commit suicide.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""die,"" ""end it with pills,"" ""liver damage,"" ""liver failure,"" and describes the physical process of dying from an overdose.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The author does not express personal emotions of hopelessness or despair. The tone is informative and cautionary, aiming to dispel myths about overdose.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""Pills"" and ""overdosing"" are discussed as methods, but these are presented hypothetically or generally, not as a plan by the author. There are no signs of preparation by the author.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to the author's past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""end it with pills.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No, the author is *not* expressing a personal desire to die or not be alive. The author is describing the consequences of an overdose to deter others.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""pills"" and ""overdosing.""
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No, not by the author.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It describes a hypothetical future event (""let's say you do end it with pills"") and the general physiological process of an overdose. It does not refer to the author's past events or current/future intentions regarding suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses suicide and methods (overdosing, pills) in detail.
    *   However, the crucial rule is: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   The author is clearly *not* expressing personal suicidal ideation or intent. Instead, the author is providing a detailed, graphic warning about the reality of overdosing, explicitly stating ""Don't take the pills"" and aiming to ""clear something up"" about the misconception of a peaceful overdose.
    *   The post's purpose is to *deter* suicide by overdose, not to express personal suicidal thoughts or plans. Therefore, the author's own suicide risk, based on this post, is non-existent.
    *   The category ""indicator"" states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" While the post contains explicit *discussion* of suicide, it does *not* contain explicit *personal suicidal expression* from the author. The author's stance is one of warning and prevention, implying a resolved or non-existent suicidal issue for themselves.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Note emotional indicators: ""I fucking hate my parents"", ""psychologically tortured"", ""couldn't even find the time to care for me"". These indicate severe emotional distress, resentment, and a feeling of being unloved and suffering.

   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses profound unhappiness with life and existence, but not a direct wish to end it.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to the poster's current state of suffering (""living a life psychologically tortured"") and past actions of their parents. There are no future intentions related to self-harm or suicide.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses extreme emotional pain and distress, and a negative view of their existence, which are strong indicators of mental health struggles and potential risk.
   - However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, no direct expression of wanting to die, no plan, and no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - According to the definitions:
     - 'ideation' requires ""explicit suicidal expression"". This is absent.
     - 'behavior' requires ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"". This is absent.
     - 'attempt' requires ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"". This is absent.
     - 'indicator' states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This fits perfectly as there is no explicit suicidal expression. The distress is high, but it remains at the level of indicating risk factors rather than direct suicidal intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end this suffering"", ""do it"" (implies ending life), ""overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"" (direct mention of self-harm/suicide attempt).
   - Emotional indicators: ""fear and despair"", ""suffering"", ""don't want to believe theres nothing"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: For past events, ""overdosed"" is a method. For current/future, there is no specific plan or method, but a desire to find a reason/strength ""to do it"" (end suffering).
   - References to past attempts: ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose."" This is an explicit mention of a past suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the intent to end life is clearly expressed (""end this suffering"", ""do it""). Crucially, a past *suicide attempt* is explicitly mentioned (""once on purpose"" regarding the overdose).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" strongly implies a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? For past events, yes (""overdosed""). For current intentions, no specific method is mentioned, only a desire to find a reason/strength to act.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of current preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. ""ive overdosed twice"" refers to past events. ""what comes after. i just need something to believe in so i can do it... please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" refers to current distress and future potential action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""end this suffering"").
   - It explicitly mentions a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" (""overdosed twice... once on purpose"").
   - The 'attempt' category definition states: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
   - This post directly matches the ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"" part of the 'attempt' category. While there is also current ideation and a tendency to act, the explicit mention of a past attempt is the most definitive element for classification according to the provided categories.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm suicidal again.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I'm suicidal again"" refers to a current state. The preceding sentences describe a recent positive period and the current relapse.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm suicidal again"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or clear tendency to commit suicide.
   - There is no mention of past self-harm behavior or suicide attempts.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation' as it has explicit suicidal expression but lacks a plan or tendency to act.

There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant.

And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""anyone on the brink of suicide"" and the author's past experiences where they ""felt like I couldn't cope"" and how ""the road has saved me in the past."" It contrasts this alternative with suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""felt like I couldn't cope,"" ""predicaments that preceded it.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific suicide plans or methods are mentioned. The ""plan"" described (going vagrant) is presented as an *alternative* to suicide, a coping mechanism.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past *suicide attempts*. It describes past feelings of being ""on the brink"" and the use of vagrancy as a way to avoid reaching that point.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""anyone on the brink of suicide.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No, not from the author. The author states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment,"" and describes how the alternative ""saved me in the past"" and is a ""comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again."" This indicates a resolved or managed suicidal issue for the author.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No suicide methods are mentioned. The methods described are for the *alternative* lifestyle (living in squats, begging, stealing).
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No signs of preparation for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to past feelings (""felt like I couldn't cope,"" ""the road has saved me in the past"") and a current, stable state (""I am a functional member of society at the moment""). It also mentions a future *contingency* (""should I ever need it again"") regarding the *alternative*, not suicide itself. The suicidal feelings are clearly framed as past and resolved by the coping mechanism.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses suicide explicitly, but the author's own experience with suicidal feelings is presented as being in the past and *resolved* by an alternative coping mechanism. The author is currently a ""functional member of society"" and views the alternative as a ""comfort"" should past feelings resurface, implying a strategy for managing mental health rather than current ideation or intent. This aligns with the definition of 'indicator' which includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues.""

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I can't go on anymore,"" ""end it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""life has been getting worse,"" ""addiction for years,"" ""drunk,"" ""so lonely,"" ""fucked up my life,"" ""miss outside,"" ""miss being happy."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, self-blame, and loneliness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it."" This indicates a clear timeline (""tonight"") and a planned state (""drunk and happy"") leading to the act. The mention of being ""drunk in my basement"" provides a setting and a means (intoxication) to facilitate the act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end it"" is a direct expression of intent to end one's life. ""I can't go on anymore"" also strongly implies this.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""then end it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? While not a specific tool, the *sequence* and *state* are mentioned: ""drunk and happy and then end it."" The context of being ""drunk in my basement"" suggests a chosen environment and a state of intoxication as part of the plan. This implies a method facilitated by alcohol and a private location.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Being ""drunk in my basement"" and stating ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" shows a clear intention, a timeline, and a setting for the act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" refers to a clear current/future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""end it,"" ""I can't go on anymore""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because there is a clear *timeline* (""tonight"") and a *tendency to act out* with a described state (""drunk and happy"") and location (""in my basement"") leading to the act. This indicates more than just thoughts; it points to a progression towards action.
    *   There is no explicit mention of a ""recent suicide attempt"" or ""historical experience of suicide attempt,"" so it does not fit 'attempt'.
    *   The combination of explicit suicidal expression, a clear timeline, and a description of the state and setting for the act (""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"") fits the description of having a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""

   - Emotional indicators: ""hopeful thought"", ""not okay right now"", ""i hope i can have that one day"", ""i can be okay"". There's a mix of current struggle (""not okay right now"") and future hope.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, but ""die"" is mentioned in the context of *not needing to* die, indicating a resolved or diminishing suicidal thought.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The expression ""maybe i don't need to die"" indicates a shift *away* from wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post expresses hope for the future (""i hope i can have that one day,"" ""maybe i don't need to die"") and acknowledges current feelings (""not okay right now""). The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" implies a past or current struggle with suicidal thoughts that is now being reconsidered or resolved.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post does not contain explicit suicidal expression. Instead, the phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" strongly suggests a *resolved* or *diminishing* suicidal thought. The overall tone is one of hope for improvement and finding a way to be okay. This aligns with the definition of 'indicator', which covers posts with no explicit suicidal expression or explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""i dont wanna die rn"", ""suicidal thoughts are always there"", ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"", ""what is the worst thing that can happen to me"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""i just wanna be calm rn because im bored and when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there."" This indicates distress and a coping mechanism (taking pills for calmness) that is linked to the presence of suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""taking 3 xanax pills"" is a specific method mentioned. The user asks about its lethality and states ""i will do it anyway i just wanna know what is the worst thing that can happen to me,"" indicating an intention to take the pills and explore their potential consequences.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts are always there.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The user states ""i dont wanna die rn,"" which implies a struggle with suicidal ideation, and the question ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" directly explores the lethal potential of an action in the context of these thoughts.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""taking 3 xanax pills.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The user states ""i will do it anyway,"" indicating an intent to perform the action. While the immediate stated goal is calmness, the concurrent questions about dying and ""the worst thing that can happen"" suggest an exploration of self-harm or suicidal outcomes related to this action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""i dont wanna die rn"" (current struggle), ""when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there"" (ongoing/current), ""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"" (current inquiry about a future action), ""i will do it anyway"" (future intention).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts are always there"").
    *   It mentions a specific method (""taking 3 xanax pills"") that the user intends to use (""i will do it anyway"").
    *   Crucially, the user explicitly asks about the lethal potential of this method (""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"") and ""what is the worst thing that can happen to me,"" directly linking the intended action to potential death or severe harm, even if the primary stated goal is calmness. This demonstrates a ""tendency to act out self-harm"" or explore the boundaries of suicide through a concrete action. It goes beyond mere ideation by involving a specific action and inquiry into its harmful consequences.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""shitface i am"", ""fucking monster"", ""hurt me"", ""scared of being abandoned"", ""abandoned him entirely"", ""don't know what to do"", ""piece of human garbage"", ""hurt my friend"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user is actively asking for information on ""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing,"" which indicates a search for methods/locations for self-harm.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""kill myself"").
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes (""i will wait until I can kill myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Not a specific *tool*, but the user is actively seeking information about *where* to self-harm discreetly, which implies a concrete intent or tendency to act out self-harm. This is a step towards a plan or method.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Seeking information about discreet self-harm locations can be considered a form of preparation or pre-contemplation for self-harm behavior.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""i will wait until I can kill myself"" refers to a future intention. ""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"" refers to a current search for information for future self-harm.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ""ideation"" because the user is not just expressing thoughts, but actively seeking practical information (""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"") regarding *how* to self-harm. This inquiry indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm,"" which aligns with the definition of 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.
    *   The combination of explicit suicidal ideation and the active search for methods/locations for self-harm clearly indicates a tendency to act, fitting the 'behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""kill myself soon"", ""wish i wasn't even born""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""strong urge"", ""dont care"", ""dont make any effort"", ""wish i wasn't even born"", ""life is fucking stupid"" (hopelessness, despair, feeling unloved/unwanted, suicidal preoccupation)
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None explicitly mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Im probably going to kill myself soon""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It does not mention a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' is crucial here. 'Ideation' is explicit suicidal expression without a plan or *tendency* to commit suicide. 'Behavior' includes explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan or *tendency to act out* self-harm or suicide.
    *   The phrases ""Im probably going to kill myself soon"" and ""I've been feeling a really strong urge to lately"" clearly indicate a *tendency to act out* on suicidal thoughts, even without a specific, detailed plan. This goes beyond mere ideation (e.g., ""I sometimes think about suicide"") into a more imminent and urgent state.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""plummet to the ground"", ""crippled instead of a corpse"" clearly indicate a desire for death by suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""so tempted"", ""if only"", ""guilt or fear"" show a strong internal struggle, desire, and hesitation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" describes a specific method (falling from a height) and a location (""highest floor""). This indicates a concrete method being considered.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the action described (""plummet to the ground"" to become a ""corpse"") is an explicit expression of wanting to die by suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" is a specific method (jumping from a height).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation, but ""so tempted to just go"" indicates a strong inclination or tendency to act on the mentioned method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""so tempted to just go..."").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""plummet to the ground"", ""corpse"").
   - It details a specific method (""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"").
   - The phrase ""so tempted to just go"" indicates a strong *tendency* or inclination to act on this method, even if there are fears preventing immediate action. This goes beyond mere ideation without a plan or tendency.
   - It does not describe a past or recent attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'behavior' category which includes explicit suicidal expression and a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Note emotional indicators: The phrase ""If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he won't feel that bad if I kill myself"" suggests feelings of guilt, self-blame, or despair, potentially linked to a desire to alleviate perceived burden or pain in others.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a hypothetical future intention (""If I... he won't feel that bad if I kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself""). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation. There is also no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts. The phrasing indicates a contemplation or thought process about suicide, rather than an immediate plan or action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""work up the nerve to jump"", ""wanted to die"", ""someone took their life the same way"" (referring to another person, but setting context for the method).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""no one notice"", ""can never get the nerve"", ""hoping I'll gain the courage"", ""maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care"" (despair, hopelessness, cry for help).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage"", ""to jump"". This indicates a specific location and method. The repeated act of going there and staying there (""Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve."") is a significant sign of preparation and a tendency to act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post states ""I can never get the nerve to jump"" and ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"", indicating no *completed* past attempts. However, it describes *repeated instances* of placing oneself in the suicidal situation (""The last time, someone came out..."", ""I go hoping..."") with the intent to jump, which constitutes a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" or ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" by repeatedly engaging in the precursor acts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""work up the nerve to jump"", ""wanted to die"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I go hoping I'll gain the courage"" implies a desire for the courage to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump"" from ""the ledge of a hospital parking garage"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the repeated act of going to the specific location and ""standing there. Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve"" is a clear sign of preparation and a tendency to act out the plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to repeated past actions (""How does no one notice when I'm standing..."", ""The last time..."", ""I go hoping..."") and ongoing/future intentions (""Trying to work up the nerve"", ""hoping I'll gain the courage"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, the post explicitly states ""I can never get the nerve to jump"" and ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"", indicating no completed attempts. However, it describes repeated *behavior* of placing oneself in a suicidal situation with intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation because the user is actively engaging in *behavior* (going to a specific location, standing on a ledge, trying to ""work up the nerve"") that is a direct precursor to suicide. This fits the ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" part of the 'behavior' category.
    *   It is not an 'attempt' because the user explicitly states they ""can never get the nerve to jump"" and ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped,"" indicating the act itself has not occurred.
    *   It is not 'indicator' as there is explicit suicidal expression and ongoing risk.
    *   It is not just 'ideation' as there are concrete actions taken towards the plan.

Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category due to the explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear tendency to act out suicide through repeated high-risk actions.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""tried committing suicide"", ""die in combat"", ""multiple attempts on my life"", ""my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""searching about ways to kill myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""struggling with depression"", ""life is going absolutely shitty"", ""hopeless"", ""hated myself"", ""mentally exhausting"", ""harder everyday"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope"" (past method), ""searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"" (current search for methods).
   - References to past attempts: ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger"", ""I have multiple attempts on my life"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The user states ""tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts on my life"", ""my death seems to ultimate answer"", and ""searching about ways to kill myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""my death seems to ultimate answer"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, for past attempts (""phone charger"", ""rope""). For current intentions, the user is ""searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident"", indicating an active search for a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""searching about ways to kill myself"" indicates preparation/research for a method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. The post describes past suicide attempts (""The first time I tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts on my life"") and current suicidal ideation with a search for methods (""its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer"", ""I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes. ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger"". ""I have multiple attempts on my life"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression and current ideation, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - The post explicitly states ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life"".
   - The definition of 'attempt' is ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
   - The mention of ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" directly matches the content of the post (""multiple attempts on my life""). While there is also current ideation and searching for methods (which could fit 'behavior'), the clear description of past attempts makes 'attempt' the most accurate classification.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""more dead inside"" (metaphorical for emotional numbness/despair), ""done with everything"" (can imply giving up on life, but not explicitly suicidal).
   - Emotional indicators: ""I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all"", ""despair"", ""done being played with"", ""done trying my best but getting no results"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. ""More dead inside"" is an idiom for emotional emptiness. ""Done with everything"" expresses extreme frustration and exhaustion, but not a direct, explicit statement of wanting to die or end one's life. It lacks the clarity required for ""explicit suicidal expression"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current feelings and intentions (""Im done being played with"", ""Im done trying my best"", ""done with everything"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post expresses profound emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of giving up on social interactions and efforts. However, it *lacks explicit suicidal expression*. Phrases like ""more dead inside"" and ""done with everything"" are strong indicators of severe emotional pain and potential risk, but they are not direct or explicit statements of suicidal intent as defined for the 'ideation' category. There is no mention of a plan, method, or historical self-harm/attempt. Therefore, it best fits the 'indicator' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"", ""Hopefully I can do it soon."" These phrases strongly indicate an intent for self-harm/suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""less scary"", ""getting more courage"" suggest a progression towards the act and a struggle with fear.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"" (specific method and location). ""It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below"" provides details about the chosen location, suggesting observation and consideration. ""getting more courage to jump"" and ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicate active mental preparation and a clear intent to act in the near future.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but the actions described (""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window"") are direct expressions of intent to cause self-harm that is likely fatal.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly ""I want to die,"" but the described action is a means to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump off"", ""jump out of my bedroom window.""
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""getting more courage"" indicates mental preparation. The mention of ""trees and mud below"" suggests observation of the environment for the act. ""Hopefully I can do it soon"" indicates an active intent to execute the plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I can jump off"", ""getting more courage"", ""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (implied by the described action).
   - It clearly outlines a specific method (""jump out of my bedroom window"") and a location (""bedroom window"" with details about what's below).
   - It expresses a strong ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" by stating ""getting more courage to jump"" and ""Hopefully I can do it soon.""
   - This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) and enters the realm of planning and intent to act. It does not describe a past or recent attempt. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" indicates a recurring, current/future tendency or behavior when depression is severe. It's not a resolved past issue.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - ""indicator"": This is incorrect as there is explicit suicidal expression (""writing suicide notes"").
   - ""ideation"": While there is explicit suicidal expression, the act of ""writing suicide notes"" goes beyond mere ideation. It suggests a concrete action or preparation, indicating a ""tendency to commit suicide.""
   - ""behavior"": This category states ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The phrase ""writing suicide notes"" fits the description of a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" because it is a preparatory step or a recurring behavior directly linked to suicidal intent. It's a concrete action taken when depression hits hard.
   - ""attempt"": This is incorrect as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the analysis, ""writing suicide notes"" signifies a tendency to act out or prepare for suicide, aligning best with the 'behavior' category.

People dying is funny hope that asshole dies hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""hope i die"", ""People dying is funny"", ""suicide watchers"", ""fuck me fuck da world"". ""suffering mentally"", ""get all depressed"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""No one cares""), despair (""suffering mentally"", ""get all depressed""), cynicism/sarcasm (""Hehe the world is funny"", ""is funny and so is the world"", ""People dying is funny"", ""maybe then ill get a good chuckle"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""hope i die"", ""suicide watchers"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""hope i die"".

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" is a direct reference to self-harm, specifically cutting. The phrase ""to deep"" indicates the severity of the self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Ah."" and ""fuck"" convey distress, pain, or frustration.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""cut"" is a specific method. The temporal marker ""Just"" indicates it's a very recent action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** It describes an action that has just occurred.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No. The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No, not explicitly. The post describes an action, not an explicit desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""cut"" is a specific method.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Not explicitly, but the act implies means were acquired.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""Just cut"" refers to a very recent or ongoing past event.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** It describes a recent act of self-harm.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** This goes beyond just an indicator; it describes an action.
    *   **ideation:** This is more than just expressing thoughts; it describes an action taken.
    *   **attempt:** This category requires ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt."" While ""cut to deep"" is severe self-harm, the post does not explicitly state it was an *attempt to end life*. It describes the act of cutting itself.
    *   **behavior:** This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*."" The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" directly describes a recent act of self-harm behavior. It fits the ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" part, as it's a direct report of a recent self-harm incident.

Based on the direct description of a self-harm act without explicit mention of suicidal intent, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

206,"This place should be made PRIVATE. I'm tired of all the people having the AUDACITY to come here, write some random fucking bullshit crap like ""don't do it!"" ""you have to live for everyone else!"" like OH MY FUCKING GOD YOU ARE SO HILARIOUS AND PATHETIC. As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice lmao. They only do that so they can feel good about themselves. ""Ah I'm such a good person"" they say to themselves. You're not. You're an attention hungry piece of shit that feeds off the misery of others",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme frustration and anger towards people who offer generic advice like ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"". The poster perceives these comments as unhelpful, self-serving, and dismissive of their feelings (""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice"").
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrases ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"" are direct references to suicidal thoughts/actions. While these are *quoted* as things *others* say, the poster's intense reaction to them strongly implies that the poster is the subject of such concern, meaning they are experiencing something that prompts these reactions.
   - Emotional indicators: Anger, frustration, resentment, despair (implied by the reaction to ""don't do it!""), feeling misunderstood.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, indirectly but clearly, through the quoted phrases ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"". The context of the post is a reaction to people trying to prevent the poster from committing suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct statement from the poster themselves, but the entire post is a frustrated reaction to being told not to die, which implies the underlying suicidal expression from the poster.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrases ""I'm tired of all the people having the AUDACITY to come here, write..."" and ""As if what I'm feeling is something I do by choice"" indicate a current, ongoing state of distress and frustration related to their current feelings that are prompting others to intervene. It implies current suicidal ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post does not contain a direct statement like ""I want to die"" from the poster. However, the entire premise of the post is the poster's angry reaction to people telling them ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"". This context strongly implies that the poster is currently experiencing suicidal thoughts, and these are the responses they are receiving. The anger is directed at the perceived insensitivity or ineffectiveness of these interventions, not a denial of the underlying suicidal state.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation.
   - There is no mention of past or recent self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - This is more than an 'indicator' because the context explicitly points to ongoing suicidal expression (even if quoted from others' reactions to the poster).
   - This is not 'behavior' as there's no plan or tendency to act, nor historical self-harm.
   - This is not 'attempt' as there's no mention of an attempt.
   - The post fits 'ideation' because it clearly implies explicit suicidal expression (through the reaction to others' attempts to prevent suicide) without a plan or tendency to act.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips"" but then says ""thinking about partially planning to die"" and ""I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst."" This indicates a nascent plan or a strong tendency towards acting on thoughts, even if concrete methods aren't available.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""suicidal thoughts"", ""thinking about partially planning to die"").
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes (""want to justify dying"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No, the post explicitly states ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The phrase ""partially planning to die"" indicates a progression beyond mere thoughts towards considering *how* to act, even if not fully concrete. The mention of impulsivity (""how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst"") suggests a tendency to act without extensive preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current and ongoing thoughts and intentions (""I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now"", ""they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months"", ""every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying"", ""I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts"", ""want to justify dying"", ""partially planning to die""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The key distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.
        *   'ideation' is ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
        *   'behavior' is ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   The phrases ""thinking about partially planning to die"" and ""I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst"" indicate more than just passive thoughts. ""Partially planning"" suggests a step beyond mere ideation towards formulating a way to act, even if not fully developed. The acknowledgment of impulsivity points to a *tendency* to act out these thoughts. Therefore, it fits the 'behavior' category due to the presence of a nascent plan and a recognized tendency to act.
    *   There is no mention of a past or recent suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts."" It also mentions ""recovered from being suicidal"" in the context of others.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what to do anymore,"" ""it's just not working,"" ""plagued with this,"" ""so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on,"" ""I'm just tired of all of it."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, and a feeling of being trapped.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""unbelievably suicidal,"" ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" phrases like ""hard to have any hope or motivation to go on"" and ""I'm just tired of all of it"" strongly imply a desire for the current suffering to end, which is characteristic of suicidal ideation. The core statement is about the *presence* of suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a current and ongoing struggle (""I am still,"" ""Day in day out,"" ""its been years""). It refers to the *persistence* of suicidal thoughts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains clear and explicit suicidal expression (""unbelievably suicidal,"" ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts""). However, it does not mention any specific plan, method, or preparation to act on these thoughts, nor does it refer to any past self-harm or suicide attempts. The content focuses on the *presence* and *persistence* of suicidal thoughts and the accompanying emotional distress, without indicating a tendency or plan to commit suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""fucked up self"", ""depression and anxiety"", ""scared"", ""literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore"". These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and lack of motivation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post focuses on the need for therapy and the barriers to accessing it.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a severe lack of motivation and a need for help (""fix my fucked up self"", ""need therapy""), but not a direct wish to die or not be alive.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current struggle and future intention to seek therapy.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post describes significant mental health distress (depression, anxiety, lack of motivation) and a strong desire to seek therapy to ""fix"" these issues. However, there is *no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, or any plans or past attempts*. The primary focus is on the struggle to access mental health support. According to the definitions:
    - 'attempt' requires explicit expression of recent or historical suicide attempt. (Not present)
    - 'behavior' requires explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan/tendency to act out self-harm/suicide, or historical self-harm. (Not present)
    - 'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression but no plan. (Not present, as there's no explicit suicidal expression)
    - 'indicator' states ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This post clearly has no explicit suicidal expression. It indicates significant distress and a need for help, which aligns with the 'indicator' category for a general risk signal without direct suicidal language.

    *   The post mentions an *idea* for a method but explicitly states ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that."" This indicates a lack of a concrete plan or a clear ""tendency to act out."" The mention of a method is in the context of an *idea* or thought, not an intention to execute.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

I realized the date when I was going through my screenshots and found the note, primed and ready to be posted on social media so nobody wonders why I stopped responding to calls or going to work. Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** Explicitly mentions ""suicide note"". The phrases ""free myself of my problems"" and ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" strongly imply suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""common denominator in all of my problems,"" ""sabotaged myself,"" ""can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc,"" ""felt so calm then when I decided how and when,"" ""trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again."" These indicate deep despair, self-blame, and a longing for the calm associated with suicidal planning.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted on social media,"" ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place."" This is a highly detailed description of preparation and planning.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a past event where a suicide plan was made (""A month ago I wrote a suicide note... Planned everything out. Picked a time and place."") but explicitly states it was not carried out (""Then sabotaged myself.""). This is a past *plan/preparation*, not a completed attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""suicide note"" and the context clearly indicate suicide.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""free myself of my problems"" and ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" are direct expressions of intent to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted on social media,"" ""Picked a time and place."" While not a physical method of self-harm, these are concrete steps of preparation and communication surrounding a suicide plan.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Absolutely, the entire description of writing the note, preparing it for posting, and picking a time and place are clear signs of preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to a detailed past event of planning (""A month ago I wrote a suicide note... Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself.""). Critically, it also expresses a current desire to re-experience that state and a future intention: ""I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It describes a detailed past plan and preparation (""wrote a suicide note,"" ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place.""). This constitutes ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (i.e., the behavior of planning and preparing for suicide).
    *   It also expresses a current ""tendency to act out"" (""I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out... Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time""), indicating a present inclination to follow through on such plans.
    *   It is not 'indicator' because there is explicit suicidal expression and detailed planning.
    *   It is not 'ideation' because there is a clear plan and a current tendency to act, not just expression without a plan.
    *   It is not 'attempt' because the post explicitly states ""Then sabotaged myself,"" meaning the act was not completed.
    *   The combination of detailed past planning/preparation (a form of ""behavior"") and current/future intent/tendency to act fits the 'behavior' category perfectly: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""

I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone,"" which is an indirect but clear expression of contemplating one's non-existence or death.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of suffering, hopelessness (""don't feel it will ever end""), despair (""utter hell,"" ""rotten pit""), loneliness (""so alone and forgotten,"" ""wish I wasn't alone""), worthlessness (""just a stain upon the world,"" ""fading memory""), and extreme distress (""crying,"" ""hanging on by threads,"" ""endless pain"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" is a direct expression of the *idea* of not being alive and the perceived lack of impact, which constitutes explicit suicidal expression in terms of conveying the thought.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current, ongoing suffering and feelings (""I am suffering,"" ""I feel,"" ""I am hanging on by threads""). The thought ""if I were gone"" refers to a current contemplation of a future state.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression through the phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone,"" indicating a contemplation of one's absence/death.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act on these thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   The profound despair and contemplation of non-existence fit the definition of 'ideation' where there is ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

   - This aligns with the definition of 'behavior': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better.

Sign me up please,"" ""I'm not afraid of death either,"" ""suicide is selfish,"" ""suicide would be better,"" and ""next morning I'm dead?"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Despite claiming not to be depressed and having support, the user expresses a profound sense of meaninglessness (""Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end?""), emptiness (""right after I feel empty""), and a desire for death.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The user details reasons *not* to act on these thoughts (dog, parents, girlfriend, friends).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past suicide attempts are mentioned. The anecdote about the robbery describes an external threat, not a self-harm attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""suicide is selfish,"" ""suicide would be better"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please,"" ""next morning I'm dead?"").

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. On the contrary, the user lists significant deterrents to acting on the thoughts, indicating a lack of preparation or immediate intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current ""suicidal thoughts"" and ongoing feelings. The ""next morning I'm dead?"" is a hypothetical scenario, not a stated intention. The robbery event is past but used to illustrate a current feeling (lack of fear of death).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""10x more suicidal"" and ""more suicidal"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worried"", ""paranoid"", ""irrational"" are present, indicating distress and anxiety.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" regarding the past incident. There is no mention of any current plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The user is asking for a hotline.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a past incident where the user called a hotline, cops were called, and they were admitted to a psych ward. However, the user clarifies, ""didn't have a method or anything,"" which indicates this was not a suicide attempt but an intervention based on perceived risk.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""10x more suicidal"" and ""suicidal"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No, the primary expression is about finding a safe hotline due to past negative experiences with interventions.

    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No. The post explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" regarding the past, and no method is mentioned for the current situation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to a past event (""Last time I called a hotline..."") and expresses current feelings (""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there,"" ""I'm just worried... Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid""). The intention is to find a hotline for current/future support.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""10x more suicidal"").
    *   There is no mention of a current plan or tendency to commit suicide. The user is actively seeking a hotline, which suggests a desire for support rather than an immediate intent to act.
    *   The past incident described was an intervention, not a suicide attempt or self-harm behavior, as explicitly stated by the user (""didn't have a method or anything"").
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide.

Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post directly uses the word ""suicidal"" (in a quoted dismissive statement) and refers to ""ended it silently"" and ""until I die."" The core theme is the struggle of someone experiencing suicidal thoughts and the dismissal they face.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong emotions are evident: ""FUCKING HATE IT,"" ""rage,"" ""angers me,"" ""despair"" (implied by ""trying to hold on to whatever the hell I have left,"" ""need help,"" ""They don't care,"" ""They won't believe it until I die,"" ""neglected it""). There's a clear sense of frustration, anger, and feeling misunderstood/neglected.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. The post explicitly states the author is ""trying to hold on"" and ""still need help,"" which points away from immediate planning.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned. There are references to past *expressions of feelings/need for help* that were neglected (""BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""suicidal,"" ""ended it silently,"" ""until I die."" While the initial ""suicidal"" is in a quoted dismissive statement, the author's subsequent rage and explanation (""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP."") strongly imply that they are personally struggling with suicidal ideation and are defending their own experience.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The author's own direct expression is ""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP."" This indicates a struggle against suicidal urges and a desire for help, rather than an explicit statement of wanting to die. However, the context of the entire post, especially the rage against being called ""attention seeking"" for expressing feelings related to being suicidal, indicates the presence of suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to past experiences of being dismissed (""Everything I do that has something to do with my feelings I get called out for 'attention seeking.'"", ""BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT""). It also expresses current struggle and desire for help (""MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP.""). The ""until I die"" refers to a potential future outcome if help isn't received.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out. There is clear explicit suicidal expression (the author's struggle with suicidal thoughts is the underlying premise of their anger and plea for help). The issue is not resolved.
    *   **ideation:** This fits well. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (the author is clearly struggling with suicidal thoughts, as evidenced by their defense of those who express them and their own plea for help/struggle to hold on). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or immediate tendency to act on these thoughts. The author explicitly states they are ""trying to hold on"" and ""still need help,"" which aligns with ideation where the individual is experiencing suicidal thoughts but is also seeking to resist them or obtain support.
    *   **behavior:** Ruled out. No plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide is mentioned. No historical experience of self-harm *behavior* is mentioned, only historical *expressions of distress* that were dismissed.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out. No recent or historical suicide attempt is mentioned.

The post's primary message is the frustration of experiencing suicidal thoughts and being dismissed, while actively trying to cope and seeking help. This aligns with the definition of ideation.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"". This clearly indicates preparation for suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer but shit, nothing here for me. over and over again only to be dissapointed."" This refers to past *consideration* or *giving life a chance*, not past *suicide attempts*.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, location) is mentioned, but *preparations* are explicitly stated: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"". This signifies a clear tendency to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions (""feel like killing my self every day"", ""Everythings ready"", ""this might be my final good bye"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, past events refer to disappointment with life, not past suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing my self"", ""final good bye"").
    *   Crucially, it mentions concrete preparations (""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done""), which indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   It does not describe a recent or historical suicide *attempt*.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I'm going to kms"" (kill myself) multiple times. It says, ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am."" and ""I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog."" It also clearly states, ""I can't stop cutting,"" which is a direct mention of ongoing self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses feelings of being overwhelmed (""holding it all in"", ""about to explode""), inability to communicate (""can't talk to anyone""), isolation (""haven't talked to anyone in a long while""), and hopelessness (""I'm not ok"", ""don't know what to do anymore"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There is no specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) mentioned for suicide. There are no signs of preparation. However, there is a clear *decision* and *intent* to commit suicide ""very soon.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** There is no mention of past *suicide attempts*. There is a clear mention of ongoing self-harm (""I can't stop cutting"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times (""kms"", ""kill myself"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *suicide* method is detailed.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No specific preparations are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current distress and clear future intentions regarding suicide (""I'm going to kms very soon""). It also mentions ongoing self-harm (""I can't stop cutting"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No past *suicide attempts* are described. Ongoing self-harm behavior is described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm going to kms"", ""kill myself very soon""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   The definition of 'ideation' states ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This post clearly expresses a *tendency* to commit suicide (""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am."") and mentions ongoing self-harm behavior.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' states ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
    *   This post fits the 'behavior' category because:
        *   It has explicit suicidal expression.
        *   It shows a strong *tendency* to act out suicide (""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon"").
        *   It explicitly mentions ongoing self-harm behavior (""I can't stop cutting""), which falls under ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (even if it's ongoing rather than strictly historical).
    *   It is not 'attempt' as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, only self-harm.

Based on the explicit mention of ongoing self-harm (""I can't stop cutting"") and the strong, accepted intent/tendency towards suicide (""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon""), the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""wanna kill myself"", ""killing myself"", "" ""suicide notes"", ""if I do it"", ""my death"", ""shoot myself on the spot"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme anger, resentment, despair, hopelessness (""ruin their lives"", ""I don't care"", ""They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""suicide notes I threw away in the trash"" (preparation), ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" (specific method).
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of a past *attempt*. The ""suicide notes"" are a past *preparation*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""wanna kill myself"", ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""shoot myself"" (implies a gun).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""suicide notes I threw away in the trash"" indicates past preparation, even if discarded.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It describes a recent intervention (""Family found out...""). The desire to ""kill myself even more"" and ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" indicates strong current and future intentions. The ""suicide notes I threw away"" refers to a past act of preparation.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past preparation (suicide notes).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** Incorrect. While there is explicit suicidal expression, there are also signs of preparation (""suicide notes"") and a specific method mentioned with strong desire (""shoot myself on the spot""), indicating a tendency to act.
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""wanna kill myself""). It also describes a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through the strong desire to ""shoot myself on the spot"" and mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" in the form of having written and discarded ""suicide notes"" (which is a preparatory behavior related to self-harm/suicide).
    *   **attempt:** Incorrect. No actual suicide attempt (recent or historical) is described, only preparation and strong intent/tendency.

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Think I'm going to OD today"", ""suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""can't feel anything right now"", ""hope for the best"" (in a desperate context).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""OD today"", ""I have a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal"", ""popping all of them at once"". This indicates a specific method and readily available means.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit past attempts, but ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"" indicates a history of suicidal ideation.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Think I'm going to OD today"", ""thinking about suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the intention to ""OD today"" and ""hope for the best"" implies a desire for death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""OD"" by ""popping all of them at once"" (referring to the listed medications).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the statement ""I have a month's prescription"" confirms possession of the means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Think I'm going to OD today"" refers to a current/future intention. ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"" refers to past ideation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No past attempts are described, only past ideation.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Think I'm going to OD today"").
   - It clearly outlines a plan (""OD"", ""popping all of them at once"") and indicates possession of the means (""I have a month's prescription"").
   - This fits the definition of 'behavior' which requires explicit suicidal expression AND a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. It is not merely ideation because of the concrete plan and means, and it is not an attempt as it describes an intention to act, not a completed or recent act.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""The end is the only thing that feels right now."" This strongly implies an end to life. The overall tone is one of farewell and finality.
   - Emotional indicators: ""Sorry,"" ""I've got nothing left,"" ""completely used up,"" ""The end is the only thing that feels right now,"" ""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person."" These convey hopelessness, despair, exhaustion, guilt, and a sense of finality.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No explicit method is mentioned. However, the post itself serves as a farewell message, apologizing to those hurt, thanking those who brought light, and saying ""Love you"" to specific family members. This is a strong sign of preparation for an imminent act, akin to a suicide note.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" is a very strong indirect expression of wanting life to end, interpreted as wanting to die, especially in the context of a farewell.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post itself functions as a goodbye message, which is a form of preparation for a final act. The apologies and expressions of love to specific individuals are characteristic of a suicide note.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current feelings and strong future intentions. ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" indicates an immediate state of mind leading to a potential imminent action. The farewell nature implies an impending departure.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (indirect but clear ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"").
   - While no specific *method* is stated, the post's nature as a farewell message (apologies, thanks, expressions of love to specific people) strongly indicates a *tendency to act out* or preparation for suicide. It reads like a suicide note. This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) and suggests an imminent intention to act. Therefore, it fits the ""behavior"" category, which includes ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal"", ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" (explicit self-harm/suicide method).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feel so bad"", ""feel terrible terrible"", ""depressed"", ""mind is going crazy"", ""incredibly overwhelmed"", ""can't even cry"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""cutting my god damn throat"" (specific method mentioned). No explicit preparations.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" indicates a past/ongoing state of suicidality, but not a past attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""suicidal"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" is a direct expression of wanting to end consciousness/life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""cutting my god damn throat"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The desire to cut the throat is a current intention/urge (""all I want to do is...""). ""I was already suicidal and depressed"" refers to a past/ongoing state.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal"", ""cutting my god damn throat""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") is mentioned as something the person ""all I want to do"". This indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical *actual* suicide attempt, only the desire/urge to act. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal expression combined with a specific method/tendency to act fits the 'behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Yes, ""Quote about suicide"", ""if you want to kill yourself"". These are part of a quote the user is referencing.
   - Emotional indicators: Not directly from the user's own emotions. The user is curious about a quote.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a quote the user ""recently stumbled upon"". The user's intention is to find more information about the quote, not to express personal suicidal intent.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the user is not expressing their own suicidal intent or thoughts. They are inquiring about a quote that contains suicidal themes. The rule states, ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned."" Since the explicit suicidal expression is from the quote and not the user's own statement, and the user is merely asking for more information about the quote, there is no explicit suicidal expression *from the user*. Therefore, it falls under 'indicator'.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions (""i want to leave earth"", ""i'm ready to join my dog"", ""i can't do this anymore""). ""i always end up wanting to die"" refers to a recurring past feeling leading to the current state.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" It also says, ""his passing has saved my life for the time being.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""My mom is already doing awful,"" ""couldn't add the loss of a child,"" ""gained a sort of appreciation for my life,"" ""don't ever want to make my mother cry.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I was going to kill myself.""
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, a past desire to die is mentioned (""I was going to kill myself""), but the current state is explicitly stated as *not* wanting to die (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""his passing has saved my life for the time being""). This indicates a resolved suicidal issue.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. Only a past intention with a timeframe (""before Christmas hit"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a *past intention* (""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself"") that is now *resolved* and no longer a current intention (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""his passing has saved my life for the time being""). The current focus is on the impact of the grandfather's death and a newfound appreciation for life.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I was going to kill myself"").
   - However, it immediately follows with a clear statement that this intention is no longer present and has been resolved (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""his passing has saved my life for the time being"").
   - The definition of 'indicator' includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" This perfectly matches the content of the post.
   - It is not 'ideation' because while there was past ideation, the current state described is one of resolution, not ongoing ideation.

    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The post repeatedly mentions ""thoughts about suicide,"" ""think about suicide,"" and ""want to commit suicide.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""want to commit suicide.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). The research is a precursor to a plan, but not preparation itself.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

It refers to past recurring thoughts (""for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts,"" ""When we fight I always think about suicide"") and current/ongoing actions (""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself""). The desire to commit suicide is presented as a current/recurring feeling.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""want to commit suicide""), which rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The user states, ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself."" This is more than just passive ideation; it's an active step towards identifying a method. While it's not a full-blown plan, this active ""research"" indicates a ""tendency to act out"" or a step towards forming a plan, which aligns with the definition of 'behavior'. It moves beyond just having thoughts to taking a preparatory action.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*.

    Therefore, the active search for methods (""research for easy painless ways"") pushes this beyond mere ideation into the 'behavior' category due to the ""tendency to act out"" implied by this action.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Life is useless"", ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"". The word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.

   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Life is useless"" combined with the desire for a state of being beyond human existence (""something better on the other side... Just a being"") strongly implies a wish not to be alive in the current form.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the post expresses a clear desire for death as a release from pain and hassle, framing it as a beautiful state of non-existence. This is an explicit expression of wanting to die or not be alive, albeit phrased poetically.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current contemplation or desire (""Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire for death and non-existence as an escape from suffering (""never feel pain anymore"", ""never deal with the hassle""). This clearly falls under ""explicit suicidal expression.""
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or any tendency to act out these thoughts. There is also no mention of past self-harm behavior or attempts.
   - Therefore, it fits the definition of ""ideation"" which is ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

233,"i'm getting my covid test results tomorrow. and i'll be deciding what to do once i get them. i've been feeling like absolute shit for the past few weeks. i've had sore throat, a possible fever, and now i have cough. aside from that, i've been feeling like a fucking outcast from everyone. my dad keeps getting mad at me for the smallest things while my friends basically don't fucking care about me. i'm so fucking tired and i want to reach out but there's literally no one i can go to. i'm literally just stuck in my head and it doesn't help that i'm also sick. all my life i just wanted to feel like i belong somewhere but i never fucking knew where. all i ever wanted was for someone to care about me so that i'd have something to hold onto, something that would give me another fucking reason to live. in the end, i receive jackshit. there's so much going on in my head that i can't even begin where to start or even know how to fix. but now, it all comes down to my covid results. if i'm negative, i'll run away. i'll leave everyone behind and whatever happens to me by then happens, it wouldn't matter anymore. if i'm positive, i'll kill myself. i used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore. i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day. it doesn't fucking matter to me anymore. this is selfish and irrational, i know, but honestly i just want to make one decision for myself for once no matter how fucking selfish it is. my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."", ""I used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore."", ""I'll use any method I can as long as I don't see another day."", ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""feeling like absolute shit"", ""fucking outcast"", ""so fucking tired"", ""stuck in my head"", ""no one i can go to"", ""never fucking knew where"", ""receive jackshit"", ""selfish and irrational"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A conditional plan is stated: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" The user also states ""I'll use any method I can as long as I don't see another day,"" indicating a strong intent to find and use a method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""i'll kill myself"", ""committing suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""as long as i don't see another day"", ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer."").

   - Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific type of method (e.g., overdose, hanging), but a clear intention to use ""any method I can."" This signifies a strong commitment to finding and executing a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post outlines a clear conditional plan (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"") which indicates mental preparation and a trigger for action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions, contingent on a specific event (COVID test results). ""i'll be deciding what to do once i get them"", ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""i'll kill myself"").
   - It also contains a clear conditional plan (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"") and a stated intention to find and use a method (""I'll use any method I can""). This demonstrates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - It does not describe a recent or historical suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, it goes beyond mere ideation (which implies no plan or tendency to commit suicide) and fits the criteria for 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill myself"", ""kill mslef"", ""stop being a burden""
   - Emotional indicators: ""Failrure"", ""burden"", ""disappointment"", ""Pleasw help, i have nobody else"" (hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, cry for help)
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (specific method and action taken)
   - References to past attempts: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" clearly describes a recent, failed suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""kill mslef"")
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""What shoul i do kill mslef and stop being a burden and a disappoinment"")

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"")
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of *taking* the substance is described, which is an action, not just preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent past event (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"") and current/future intentions (""What shoul i do kill mslef"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a recent, failed suicide attempt is explicitly described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"", which is a direct description of a recent, failed suicide attempt. The subsequent question ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" indicates ongoing suicidal intent following the attempt. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'attempt'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, substance) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? A clear plan with a specific timeframe (""on my birthday in two weeks"") is stated.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""my first failed attempt in October.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It describes a clear future plan to commit suicide (""I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks""), which aligns with the ""behavior"" category's ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" criterion.
    *   Crucially, the post also explicitly mentions a ""first failed attempt in October."" The ""attempt"" category is defined as: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, *or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*.""
    *   Since the post directly mentions a ""failed attempt,"" it perfectly matches the ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"" part of the 'attempt' category definition. While elements of 'behavior' are present (the future plan), the explicit mention of a past suicide attempt places it firmly in the 'attempt' category, which represents a higher level of risk and directly matches the specific wording in the definition.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared."" This directly references the concept of ""hurt myself"" and distressing thoughts associated with it.

These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Not the word ""suicide,"" but the phrase ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself"" explicitly introduces the concept of self-harm, indicating that these thoughts are present, even if a plan isn't. This constitutes an explicit suicidal expression by acknowledging the presence of thoughts about ""hurt myself.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Not directly, but ""I can't take it anymore"" combined with ""drowning in these awful thoughts"" strongly implies a desire for an end to suffering, which is a core component of suicidal ideation. The explicit mention of ""hurt myself"" solidifies this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No. The post explicitly states ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression through the phrase ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts."" This indicates that the idea of self-harm is present and distressing to the individual.
    *   However, the post explicitly states ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself,"" meaning there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide mentioned.
    *   This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" It does not fit 'indicator' because there is explicit suicidal expression. It does not fit 'behavior' or 'attempt' because there is no plan, action, or past attempt mentioned.

I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them.

I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains multiple explicit mentions of wanting to die (""I fucking hate being alive"", ""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time"", ""I haven't died because of the old 'your parents will be sad dummy' thing""). It also includes passive death wishes (""Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me""). The user describes imagining self-harm (""I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself""), but explicitly states, ""I've never purposely hurt myself"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of despair, hopelessness, self-loathing, anger, fear, anhedonia (""I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan for suicide (e.g., method, time, location, means) is mentioned. The self-harm thoughts are explicitly stated as *imagined* and not acted upon.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The user mentions being ""hospitalized in highschool for depression,"" but this is not explicitly stated as a suicide attempt. Furthermore, the user explicitly states, ""I've never purposely hurt myself,"" which indicates no history of self-harm *behavior*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The user directly states ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I'm so afraid to die but I fucking hate being alive.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The imagined self-harm is explicitly stated as not acted upon.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily describes current feelings and intentions (""I want to die"", ""I think about dying every day""). It refers to past events like being hospitalized for depression and high school, but these are contextual, not direct suicide attempts.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No. The hospitalization was for ""depression,"" and the user explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains clear and explicit suicidal expressions, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or a ""tendency to act out"" suicide or self-harm. The imagined self-harm is explicitly stated as not having been acted upon (""I've never purposely hurt myself"").
    *   There is no mention of historical self-harm *behavior* or suicide *attempts*. The hospitalization was for depression, not an attempt, and the user denies past self-harm.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'ideation' category, as it has explicit suicidal expression but no plan or tendency to commit suicide, nor historical self-harm/attempt behavior.

However, it does not describe a specific plan or active tendency to commit suicide (e.g., acquiring means, detailing a method of self-harm). The desire to ""die in my sleep"" is a passive wish for death rather than an active intent to cause it. There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts. Based on the definitions, this aligns best with 'ideation' (explicit suicidal expression but no plan or tendency to commit suicide).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Zoloft overdose"", ""wasn't enough to kill me"". This clearly indicates an action taken with the intent to die.
   - Emotional indicators: The post is factual, describing a past event and its physical aftermath, and asking for advice. The phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" implies a past intent to end life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method and quantity are mentioned: ""Zoloft overdose"", ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg"". This describes an action that was carried out.
   - References to past attempts: The entire post describes a past action (""at 11:30 I took..."") taken with the explicit intent to die (""wasn't enough to kill me""), which the user states failed.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" in the context of an ""overdose"" explicitly conveys a past intent to die.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Hope my plan works though"" explicitly states that a plan exists, even if the method is not detailed. ""made my decision"" and ""At peace knowing it's soon"" indicate a decision has been made and the act is anticipated.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Hopeless,"" ""felt hopeless for months,"" ""realizing you're hopeless is too much."" The user also rejects encouragement (""I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method or direct preparation for an act is mentioned. However, seeking a ""suicide forum"" suggests a proactive step to engage with the topic of suicide, potentially to find information, methods, or support for suicidal acts.
    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide forum.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly, but the profound hopelessness and the desire to find a ""suicide forum"" strongly imply a desire for death or an end to suffering.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Seeking a ""suicide forum"" can be interpreted as a form of preparation, as it's an active step towards gathering information or community related to suicide. It's not a passive thought.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings (""felt hopeless for months,"" ""I'm unemployed"") and a current/future intention (""I just want to find an actual suicide forum"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': This is incorrect because there is explicit suicidal expression (""suicide forum"").
    *   'ideation': This category requires explicit suicidal expression but ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" While there's no explicit *plan* for suicide, the desire to ""find an actual suicide forum"" goes beyond mere passive suicidal thoughts. It indicates an active pursuit of information or community related to suicide. This active search suggests a *tendency* to explore or facilitate suicide, moving beyond just having the idea.
    *   'behavior': This category requires explicit suicidal expression *and* ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" The explicit mention of ""suicide forum"" fulfills the ""explicit suicidal expression"" requirement. The phrase ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum"" indicates a proactive step, a stated desire to seek out resources related to suicide. This active search for a forum can be interpreted as a ""tendency to act out"" because it's a step towards potentially acquiring information, methods, or support for a suicidal act. It's not merely thinking about suicide; it's actively seeking to engage with it in a way that could lead to action.
    *   'attempt': This is incorrect as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    The key distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' here lies in ""tendency to commit suicide"" vs. ""tendency to act out."" Seeking a suicide forum is an active step that suggests a strong inclination to move towards acting on suicidal thoughts, even if the specific method or timeline is not yet defined. It's a preparatory or exploratory action related to the suicidal intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""what's really the point?"" strongly implies a questioning of the value of life, which can be interpreted as an indirect expression related to not wanting to continue living. No direct mention of suicide, death, or self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressed life,"" ""can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past,"" ""everything that made my happiness has now left me,"" ""if life won't ever be as good again."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and a sense of meaninglessness regarding the future.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The rhetorical question ""what's really the point?"" in the context of extreme despair and perceived permanent loss of happiness serves as a strong, albeit indirect, expression of questioning the value of life or wanting to cease living. It implies that if life won't be good, there's no reason to continue.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post expresses current feelings of despair about the future (""can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past"") and a present questioning of the ""point"" of life.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses deep despair and hopelessness, questioning the fundamental ""point"" of life if future happiness is impossible. This goes beyond general sadness and enters the realm of existential questioning often associated with suicidal thoughts.
    *   While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrase ""what's really the point?"" in this context is a clear, explicit (though indirect) expression of contemplating the cessation of life.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act.
    *   There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   Therefore, it fits the 'ideation' category, which describes explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""highest chance of death"", ""jump from a bridge"". The phrase ""hopefully everything pans out the way I want"" in this context implies a desire for the suicide attempt to be successful.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I doubt anyone will answer me"" suggests feelings of isolation or hopelessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""jump from a bridge"" is a specific method. ""which one do I have the highest chance of death"" indicates seeking information to execute a plan. ""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend"" shows a clear intention and timeframe for action.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""jump from a bridge"" with the goal of ""highest chance of death"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""highest chance of death"" and hoping the plan ""pans out the way I want"" (implying successful death).

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump from a bridge"".

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (though not using the word ""suicide""), mentions a specific method (""jump from a bridge""), and clearly indicates a plan and tendency to act (""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend""). This aligns directly with the definition of 'behavior' which states ""the post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm**: The post states, ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip."" This is an expression of feeling trapped in pain and *unable* to die or escape, rather than a direct wish to die or an explicit suicidal thought.
    *   **Emotional indicators**: Strong indicators of hopelessness, despair, feeling misunderstood (""never understands me"", ""treat me like shit"", ""not who I want to be"", ""alien"", ""suffer"", ""live in pain"", ""pain will never loosen it's grip"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The statement ""I will never die, I will never be free"" expresses a conviction of *eternal* suffering and an inability to escape, not a direct desire to end life. It's about being trapped in pain.

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post expresses profound emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped in suffering. However, it *lacks explicit suicidal expression*. The phrasing ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip."" indicates a despair about the *permanence* of pain and an *inability* to escape it, rather than a direct wish to die or an intent to commit suicide. It does not explicitly state a desire to end one's life. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'indicator' as it has no explicit suicidal expression.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions the sister ""willingly and voluntarily ended her life"" and ""had made attempts in the past."" For the poster, it states, ""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."" and ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" It also states, ""the idea of that state [sleep] lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""can't shake the pain"", ""so many questions and so much doubt"", ""doesn't feel that far-fetched"", ""welcome end to everything"", ""don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore"", ""not particularly excited about to put off by it"", ""why bother going through all of it?"".

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything."", ""At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from."").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** Yes, the poster describes an ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""welcome end to everything,"" ""sleep lasting forever"") and therefore is not 'indicator'.
    *   While there is no *current* plan, the post explicitly mentions a *historical experience of a suicide attempt* by the person writing the post (""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"").
    *   The definition for 'behavior' includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" An aborted suicide attempt is a form of self-harm behavior.
    *   The definition for 'attempt' includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" An ""aborted attempt at suicide"" directly fits this criterion.
    *   Given that 'attempt' is generally considered a more severe category than 'behavior' and specifically covers ""suicide attempt"" (whereas 'behavior' covers ""self-harm behaviour"" which is broader), the most precise classification for a mentioned historical suicide attempt is 'attempt'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrase ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" strongly implies suicide or self-harm with lethal intent. ""it's for the best"" in this context also points to ending life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""disappointment,"" ""nothing,"" ""no hope anymore,"" ""no joy anymore,"" ""no emotion anymore,"" ""pain in numb."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and emotional detachment.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" is a clear statement of a specific method and location. ""there will be less of a mess"" indicates a consideration for the aftermath, which is part of planning.

    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""in the tub.""
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""there will be less of a mess"" shows consideration for the act's practicalities, indicating preparation/planning.

    *   It clearly outlines a specific plan/method (""in the tub"") and a tendency to act (""I plan on doing it"").
    *   It does not mention a past suicide attempt.

   - Emotional indicators: ""I just want the pain to go away"" indicates significant distress, suffering, and a desire for relief. ""Can someone just hug me please"" indicates a need for comfort and support.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""I just want the pain to go away"" expresses a desire for relief from suffering, but not explicitly a desire for death or non-existence. It is a general cry for help.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings/intentions (""I just want the pain to go away"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post expresses severe emotional pain and a desire for relief and comfort.
   - However, there is no *explicit* mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any form of self-harm. The language used (""I just want the pain to go away"") is general and does not directly convey suicidal intent or ideation, although it suggests significant distress that could be a precursor.
   - According to the definitions, 'ideation' requires ""explicit suicidal expression."" This post lacks that explicit expression.
   - 'behavior' and 'attempt' also require explicit suicidal expression or mention of specific actions/history, which are not present.
   - The 'indicator' category states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression or has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" Since there is no explicit suicidal expression, this post fits the 'indicator' category. It indicates distress but not explicit suicidal thoughts.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""wanting to end it."" It also describes severe self-harming behaviors: ""Taking pain killers and antidepressants... secretly to cope... it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self."" This describes chronic self-neglect and substance abuse causing physical harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, despair, chronic pain, paranoia, sleeplessness, body dysmorphia, anorexia, melancholia, brain fog, inability to concentrate, neglect, loneliness, trauma, bullying, abandonment, crippling depression, infuriation, feeling like an ""absolute failure,"" and ""never deserved anything.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details a method of self-harm: abuse of paracetamol leading to liver/digestive damage, and starvation. This is a description of past and ongoing harmful actions.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The description of paracetamol abuse and starvation causing physical damage (""damaged my liver my digestive system"") is a clear historical experience of self-harm behavior, even if not explicitly labeled a ""suicide attempt"" by the user.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" ""wanting to end it.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wanting to end it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self."" This describes a method of self-harm that has caused physical damage.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The description of ongoing addiction and self-starvation indicates a continuous pattern of self-harm.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post begins with ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" indicating current suicidal intent. It then extensively details past traumatic experiences and current struggles, including the past *behavior* of paracetamol abuse and starvation (""It damaged my liver...""). This past behavior is presented as a contributing factor to the current suicidal ideation.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? The detailed account of paracetamol abuse and starvation causing physical harm (""damaged my liver my digestive system"") is a description of historical self-harm *behavior*. The user does not explicitly label it a ""suicide attempt,"" but it clearly falls under ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   'ideation': Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression *and* a detailed description of past self-harm behavior.
    *   'behavior': This category fits well. The post has ""explicit suicidal expression"" (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"") and ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (paracetamol abuse leading to liver damage, starvation). The self-harm described (paracetamol abuse, starvation) also indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm.""
    *   'attempt': While the self-harm described is severe and has caused physical damage, the user does not explicitly state it was a ""suicide attempt"" that failed or was interrupted. They describe it as an addiction/coping mechanism that led to damage. The 'behavior' category specifically includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour,"" which aligns perfectly with the description of paracetamol abuse and starvation.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression and the detailed description of past self-harm behaviors that caused physical harm, the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate classification.

""cutting myself again"" (specific method, implies past behavior and current inclination).
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"" and ""I was getting over my suicidal thoughts"" refer to past *ideation*. ""I feel like cutting myself again"" refers to past *self-harm behavior*, not a past *suicide attempt*.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" This outlines a specific method (train) and location (train station/tracks). ""cutting myself again"" also mentions a method (cutting).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station"" indicates a current thought process towards enacting a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post expresses current suicidal intent (""I really want to fucking kill myself"") and current/future plans (""I'm thinking about running away to the train station...""). It also refers to past self-harm behavior (""cutting myself again"") and past suicidal thoughts.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, past *suicidal thoughts* and past *self-harm behavior* are mentioned, but not past *suicide attempts*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I really want to fucking kill myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by describing a specific plan for suicide (""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head"").
    *   It also mentions a tendency to act out self-harm and historical experience of self-harm behavior (""I feel like cutting myself again"").
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   'ideation' is explicit suicidal expression *without* a plan or tendency. This post *has* a plan and tendency.
        *   'behavior' is explicit suicidal expression *with* a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or* mentioned historical experience of self-harm behavior. This post fits all parts of this definition.
        *   'attempt' requires explicit expression concerning a recent suicide attempt or mentioned historical experience of a suicide attempt. This post describes past self-harm behavior, but not a past *suicide attempt*. The current plan is a *plan* for suicide, not an *attempt*.

Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""end my own life,"" and ""I'm going to try again."" It also mentions ""failing,"" which in context refers to a past suicide attempt.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user states, ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of."" While the exact method is not named, it describes its characteristics, implying a specific, more lethal approach. There's also a mention of potential timing (""tommorow maybe,"" ""next week, maybe next month, maybe next year"") and a contingency (""unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off"").
    *   **References to past attempts:** The phrase ""I feel shame for failing"" directly implies a past suicide attempt that was not successful. ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real"" also suggests a history of such actions or thoughts.

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""end my own life,"" ""I'm going to try again.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The entire post revolves around this desire and intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not by name, but a *type* of method is described (""different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of,"" ""bc my math is off""). This indicates a conceived method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method"" indicates a clear intent to prepare and act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""I feel shame for failing"" refers to a past event (a failed attempt). ""I'm going to try again"" refers to a current intention for a future act.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the ""failing"" explicitly describes a historical suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It describes a clear plan/tendency to act out suicide (""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method""). This fits the 'behavior' category.
    *   Crucially, the post also explicitly mentions ""failing,"" which in the context of ""trying to kill myself"" means a past suicide attempt. The definition of 'attempt' includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
    *   Since the post explicitly states a historical suicide attempt (""failing""), it directly meets the criteria for the 'attempt' category. While it also describes future plans (which would fit 'behavior'), the explicit mention of a past attempt places it in the 'attempt' category, which represents the highest level of risk due to a history of acting on suicidal thoughts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this."" ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital."" ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it."" ""I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""lost"", ""alone"", ""no one understands me"", ""hurts so much"", ""hate myself"", ""living hell"", ""unbearable"", ""more mistakes and ruin"". These indicate extreme hopelessness, despair, self-loathing, and feeling like a burden.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tool, location, substance) are mentioned. No signs of preparation.
   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it"" indicates a desire to have acted, but explicitly states a fear that prevented it, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""I would have done it already"", ""if I did it"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this."" ""I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No. The post mentions fear of ""botching it"" but no specific method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The core suicidal thoughts are current (""I can't anymore"", ""I'm on the edge"") and contemplate future action (""if I did it""). The ""I would have done it already"" refers to a hypothetical past action that was *prevented* by fear, not an actual past attempt.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I can't anymore"", ""I'm on the edge"", ""I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it"", ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it"").
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned.
   - There is no indication of a *tendency* to act, as the fear of ""botching it"" is explicitly stated as a barrier preventing action.
   - There are no mentions of historical self-harm behavior or suicide attempts.
   - This fits the definition of 'ideation': explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide.

I can afford my bills (barely) but we have food and a roof over our head. But even before he was born I have had depression. I'm sure his mom cheating on me and leaving us 4 years ago didn't help. ( Not doctor diagnosed but I assume do to always been looking at things as glass being empty and not wanting to live.) Now as I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life. Of course I will wait till he's an adult but I just can't seem to get my life together. Every job I have ever wanted I can't get because my experience is in different fields. Females don't like me because of the dad bod. I feel I'm at the point of just no success. I'm over being a failure. But I don't have motivation. I have tried but i just feel like a waste of space. This thing called a life is too much. I would say I'm suicidal but I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that. 11 more years then yes I could be there but for now he just has a non successful dad that he is probably ashamed of. How do I deal with the pain of life.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""not wanting to live"", ""comfortable with leaving this life"", ""leaving this life"", ""I would say I'm suicidal"", ""Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""hating myself"", ""depression"", ""glass being empty"", ""no success"", ""over being a failure"", ""waste of space"", ""pain of life"", ""failure to my son, my parents, and everyone around me"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The post explicitly states ""I don't have the balls to actually do it."" and ""Of course I will wait till he's an adult"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly denies immediate action: ""I don't have the balls to actually do it."" and ""Of course I will wait till he's an adult"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings (""I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life"") and a future, conditional intention (""Of course I will wait till he's an adult but I just can't seem to get my life together. ... 11 more years then yes I could be there""). No past attempts are described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I would say I'm suicidal"", ""not wanting to live"", ""comfortable with leaving this life"").
   - However, it explicitly states ""I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that. 11 more years then yes I could be there"". This indicates a lack of immediate plan or tendency to commit suicide. The deferral of action until a future point (when his son is an adult) and the stated lack of courage to act now clearly place it within the 'ideation' category, as there is no current plan or tendency to act out.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I'm struggling to hold on,"" ""I just want off this life"" refer to current feelings and intentions. ""Been depressed and feeling like shit for years & years"" provides historical context for the current state.

   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method.

""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends"" (internal conflict, fear of consequences for others).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The question ""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends"" indicates a thought process about the impact of suicide, but not a concrete plan for the act itself.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes (""I need to kill myself"", ""me killing myself"").

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I need to kill myself"", ""life just isn't worth it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on the presence of a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". While the user expresses a strong desire/need to die, they do not mention a specific method, time, or location, nor any concrete steps of preparation. The internal conflict (""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family"") suggests contemplation rather than immediate, planned action. Without a concrete plan or clear steps towards acting out, it fits the definition of 'ideation' more closely than 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'll be gone"" (implying death/suicide), ""no point in trying anymore"", ""tired of fighting this constantly"".
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness (""no possible way to turn my life around"", ""no point in trying anymore"", ""can't escape""), exhaustion (""so tired of fighting this constantly"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method, but a clear *timeframe* (""By this time next week"").
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, but ""I'll be gone"" is a very strong indirect expression of suicidal intent.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'll be gone"" and ""no point in trying anymore"" clearly indicate a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation, but the statement ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" indicates a concrete intention to act within a defined timeframe, which implies a plan is forming or has been made, even if the method is unstated.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""By this time next week I'll be gone"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'll be gone"", ""no point in trying anymore"").
   - The phrase ""By this time next week I'll be gone"" indicates a clear *tendency to act* within a specific, near-future timeframe. This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts of suicide) and suggests a decision to act, aligning with the ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" criteria for the 'behavior' category. While a specific method isn't named, the temporal commitment elevates the risk significantly from passive ideation.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly discusses ""suicide attempt,"" ""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" and actions taken ""with the intention of dying."" It also mentions ""self-harm"" implicitly through the description of actions.
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses struggle (""struggle to not think about,"" ""struggle to categorize,"" ""genuinely bothered me,"" ""weighing on me,"" ""bothering me"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: While the specific method isn't detailed, the user describes ""testing my method"" and ""went until shortly before the point of no return,"" indicating engagement with a specific means. For the second event, they ""went in with the intention of dying,"" implying a plan was in place.
   - References to past attempts: The post describes two specific past events. The first was ""testing my method"" and stopping ""shortly before the point of no return."" The second was going ""in with the intention of dying"" but stopping oneself. The user is questioning whether these constitute ""a suicide attempt.""

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide attempt"" is the central theme of the post.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, for the second event, the user states, ""I went in with the intention of dying.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific tools/substances are named, but the *process* of engaging with a method is described (""testing my method,"" going ""until shortly before the point of no return,"" ""went in with the intention of dying"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the descriptions of ""testing my method"" and ""went in with the intention of dying"" imply preparation and engagement with a means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post primarily refers to past events (""in the past year or two,"" ""Both of these happened long enough ago""). The current state is described as ""tenuously better,"" but the past events are ""weighing on me.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, two distinct events are described where the user engaged in actions with suicidal intent or testing a suicidal method, one of which explicitly states ""I went in with the intention of dying"" but stopped. The user is questioning if these are ""attempts,"" but the description of the second event aligns with an interrupted suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression and detailed descriptions of past actions.
   - 'ideation': Incorrect. The post goes beyond mere thoughts; it describes concrete actions taken towards self-harm/suicide.
   - 'behavior': This category includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The first event (""testing my method,"" stopping before the point of no return) clearly falls under ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
   - 'attempt': This category includes ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The second event, where the user states, ""I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself,"" describes an interrupted suicide attempt. Even though the user is unsure how to categorize it, the description itself constitutes a ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The key is the *description* of the event, not the user's self-labeling. An interrupted attempt is still an attempt.

Given the explicit description of an action taken ""with the intention of dying"" that was then stopped, this aligns directly with the definition of a historical suicide attempt (specifically, an interrupted one).

Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

It also includes the rhetorical question ""So what do I have to live for?"" implying a desire for non-existence. The phrase ""I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions"" indicates a desire for emotional numbness, not physical self-harm.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Strong feelings of hopelessness (""Why exactly should I even have hope anymore?"", ""nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals""), despair, profound sadness, anger (""Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself.""), resentment towards others (friends, family, girls), and self-loathing (""I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I probably deserve to suffer."").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There are no mentions of specific plans (e.g., a time, place), methods (e.g., tools, substances), or preparations for suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts. The mention of ""I bullied other kids"" refers to past actions against others, not self-harm or suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through direct expressions like ""I really want to die.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I really want to die."" and ""Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The desire to die is expressed as a current feeling (""I really want to die""). The reasons for this feeling are rooted in past experiences (childhood, relationships), but the suicidal ideation itself is present. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I really want to die"", ""I'd rather die""), which rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or clear tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. The desire to ""kill off my emotions"" is about emotional numbness, not a physical self-harm behavior. The thought ""Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself"" is an expression of anger/revenge, not self-harm.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the description of 'ideation' because it has explicit suicidal expression but lacks a plan or clear tendency to commit suicide.

    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""looking up how to do it"" suggests researching methods, which falls under a tendency or preparation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post refers to current contemplation (""contemplating suicide"", ""looking up how to do it"") and future desires/intentions (""wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because it mentions specific methods (""jump in front of a car"", ""stab myself"") and a clear tendency/research (""looking up how to do it""). The definition of 'ideation' states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"".
    *   The presence of specific methods and the act of ""looking up how to do it"" aligns with the 'behavior' category, which includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical *attempt*, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression, the mention of specific methods, and the act of ""looking up how to do it"" (indicating a tendency or research into a plan), the post best fits the 'behavior' category.

If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I don't want to be here anymore"", ""I want out so bad"", ""I want to leave and never come back"", ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all"", ""If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nothing Is Beautiful"", ""All my life has been is work, be alone, disappointment and failure""), despair (""I'm so fucking done with this shit""), anger/frustration (""Fuck the entire human race"", ""I hate this so much""), self-loathing (""I'm so fucking stupid"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific personal plan or method is mentioned. The wish for a nuclear bomb is a general, apocalyptic desire, not a personal suicide plan.
   - References to past attempts: No references to past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I don't want to be here anymore"", ""I want out so bad"", ""I want to leave and never come back"", and the wish for a nuclear bomb to ""kill us all"" and ""Rest In Peace"" are strong expressions of a desire for non-existence or death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *personal* method is mentioned. The ""nuclear bomb"" is a general, external event, not a personal means for self-harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post expresses current feelings and a desire for a future state of non-existence or death. Past events (ex-partner leaving) are mentioned as a source of pain, but the desire to ""not be here anymore"" is current.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""I don't want to be here anymore"", ""I want out so bad"", ""I want to leave and never come back""). This means it's not 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific personal plan or method for suicide. The wish for a nuclear bomb is a general desire for collective death, not a concrete personal plan.
   - There is no mention of historical experience of self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""It will all be done after I die."", ""I want to die"", ""pull the trigger"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""so much pressure"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""pull the trigger"" (implies a gun as a method).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pull the trigger"" clearly indicates a method (a gun).
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation, but the mention of a specific method (""pull the trigger"") indicates a tendency to act out.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""It will all be done after I die."", ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - It also contains a specific method (""pull the trigger"") and a clear intention/tendency to act out (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""). This moves it beyond mere 'ideation' (which has no plan or tendency).
   - There is no mention of a *recent* or *historical* suicide *attempt*, only a current intention with a method. Therefore, it does not fit 'attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan/tendency to act out self-harm or suicide fits the definition of 'behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I hurt myself two months ago,"" indicating past self-harm. It also states, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal ideation.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys feelings of neglect (""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""It's like she doesn't care for my Problems""), hopelessness (""nothing happend""), pain (""couldn't hide my pain""), and exhaustion (""tired all the time,"" ""tired of putting a mask on"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan or method for suicide is mentioned. The ""wounds"" mentioned are a result of past self-harm, not preparation for a future suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I hurt myself two months ago"" is a direct reference to a past act of self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" is a direct expression of wanting to die or seeking freedom through death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for *suicide* are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation for *suicide* are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to a past event (""I hurt myself two months ago"") and expresses a current desire/ideation concerning death (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? A past *self-harm* incident is described (""I hurt myself two months ago""). The phrasing doesn't explicitly state it was a ""suicide attempt.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""), which rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post also mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""I hurt myself two months ago"").
    *   The 'ideation' category states ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" While there's no *current* plan for suicide, the mention of past self-harm moves it beyond simple ideation.
    *   The 'behavior' category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*."" This perfectly matches the post, as it has explicit suicidal ideation and a clear mention of past self-harm.
    *   The 'attempt' category requires ""recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The post says ""I hurt myself,"" which is self-harm, but not explicitly stated as a ""suicide attempt."" The 'behavior' category's inclusion of ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" is a more precise fit for ""I hurt myself.""

Based on the explicit suicidal ideation and the mentioned historical self-harm behavior, 'behavior' is the most appropriate classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" multiple times (""the more suicidal I get"", ""twice as suicidal""), ""suicide"" multiple times (""conversations with myself about suicide"", ""think about suicide every day"", ""seriously consider it"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""want help and to get better"", ""can't tell anyone"", ""wouldn't feel so alone"", ""sad all the time"", ""sit alone in my room"", ""worried I would go to hell"", ""can't afford that"", ""so much to carry alone"", ""It's too much"". These indicate feelings of hopelessness, isolation, despair, and being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states: ""I write detailed plans in my journal"". This is a direct indication of a plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. It mentions the thoughts have been present for ""seven years"" but not attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implied by ""the more suicidal I get"" and ""seriously consider it"", despite the subsequent statement ""But I know I would never do it"". The *consideration* and *planning* are present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *methods* are detailed in the post, but the *existence* of plans is clearly stated: ""I write detailed plans in my journal"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the act of ""writing detailed plans"" in a journal is a form of preparation or formulation of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   **indicator:** Ruled out. There is explicit suicidal expression and ongoing issues, not resolved ones.
    *   **ideation:** Ruled out. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the definition of ideation states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"". This post explicitly mentions ""I write detailed plans in my journal"", which indicates a plan.
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best. The post has explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal"", ""suicide""). Crucially, it also states ""there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" as evidenced by ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" and ""almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal"". The act of writing detailed plans is a concrete step that goes beyond mere thought, aligning with the ""plan or tendency to act out"" aspect of the 'behavior' category. The user's internal barrier (""I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did"") does not negate the existence of the detailed plans or the frequent consideration.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out. There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""commiting suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just want it to be over"" strongly implies a desire for life to end. ""Don't want to do this anymore"" in context of hating life suggests not wanting to continue living.
   - Emotional indicators: ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit"" (self-loathing, despair), ""Don't want to do this anymore"" (exhaustion, desire to cease), ""I don't want to be alone any more"" (loneliness, despair), ""I hate every part of my life"" (hopelessness, misery), ""I'm sick and tired"" (exhaustion), ""Please please please"" (desperation, plea for an end).

   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act out.
   - There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - Based on the definitions:
     - 'indicator' is ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression.
     - 'behavior' is ruled out because there is no plan/tendency to act out or historical self-harm.
     - 'attempt' is ruled out because there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times."" The 'attempt' category description includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This phrase directly matches the content of the post.

I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming.

    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Primarily current feelings and future intentions/considerations regarding suicide. ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"" and the detailed discussion of methods refer to a current struggle with the *how-to*.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death,"" ""End it now""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation because there is a detailed discussion of specific methods (""shotgun,"" ""handguns...shooting myself through my upper palate,"" ""overdosing"") and an explicit statement of having ""looked into other options."" This indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" by actively researching and considering means and methods. The fear expressed is about the *process* and *outcome* of death, not a lack of desire for death itself.
    *   There is no mention of a recent suicide attempt or historical experience of a suicide attempt by the poster, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.
    *   The detailed consideration of methods and the implied research (""I've looked into other options"") aligns with the 'behavior' category's description of having a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out?

This moves it beyond simple ideation.
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best.

This is an active internal struggle with an urge to engage in behavior that could lead to harm, demonstrating a disregard for personal safety.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out. No mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the explicit suicidal expressions and the expressed ""tendency to act out self-harm"" through the urge to wander off with a disregard for consequences, the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate.

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The user expresses a desire for ""the constant anxiety and sadness... to stop by crashing into another car,"" and states they are ""afraid that I won't die on impact and that I'll just end up with pain that doesn't kill me."" This clearly indicates a desire for death as a means to end suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""constant anxiety and sadness,"" ""pointless situation,"" ""afraid.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method is mentioned: ""crashing into another car."" The phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates a recurrent tendency or near-action towards this plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit past attempts are mentioned, but ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests a history of nearly acting on the suicidal plan.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (desire for death via car crash).
    *   A specific plan/method (""crashing into another car"") is identified.
    *   There is a clear ""tendency to act out"" this plan, as indicated by ""frequently come close to doing it."" This goes beyond mere contemplation (ideation) into a pattern of near-action. The fear of *not* dying reinforces the seriousness of the intent behind the contemplated action.

    *   Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: ""Death is an option"", ""thinking death is an option"", ""suicidal thought"", ""die (not suffering)"", ""not the worst outcome"".

    *   References to past attempts: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, by asking ""Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought?"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression of wanting to die. The post explicitly states ""I won't commit"" and discusses death as a non-negative outcome *if it happens accidentally*, not as something actively desired or planned.

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current conceptual thought (""Death is an option. Does thinking...""). It explicitly denies future intention (""I won't commit"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly mentions ""death"" and ""suicidal thought"" as a concept.
    *   However, it immediately qualifies this with ""I won't commit,"" which is a clear statement of no current intent or plan to act.
    *   The scenario of death is framed as an ""accident,"" not a self-inflicted act.
    *   The definition of 'indicator' includes ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" The statement ""I won't commit"" directly indicates that any potential suicidal issue raised by the initial thought is resolved or not present as an active intent. It's a philosophical contemplation or a question about a thought, rather than an active suicidal ideation.
    *   'Ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression *without* a plan or tendency. While ""Death is an option"" could be seen as an expression, the immediate denial (""I won't commit"") negates the ""tendency to commit suicide"" aspect, pushing it away from active ideation towards a resolved or non-active state.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""finally kill me"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.

   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Tonight is the last chance I have to finally kill me"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""finally kill me""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by clearly stating a specific timeframe (""Tonight is the last chance""), a long-term plan (""Its been a year since i planned this""), and active preparation (""I even have the stuff prepared and everything""). This indicates a strong ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical *attempt*, only the intention and preparation to act. Therefore, 'attempt' is not the correct category.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear plan and preparation aligns perfectly with the definition of 'behavior'.

   - References to past attempts: No.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""this just ends"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""stop eating all together and starve myself"". This is a concrete method of self-harm intended to lead to death.

   - It details a specific plan or tendency to act out self-harm/suicide (""I've decided to stop eating all together and starve myself"").
   - It does not describe a past or recent suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'behavior' category which includes explicit suicidal expression with a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.

293,"Here's the deal. I'm not ok. I haven't been ok for a very long time. Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch. In my past I've had everything that made me who I am stripped away from my character time and time again. It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive. But for now, in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness I've come to befriend over the last few months, but I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** No direct mentions of ""suicide,"" ""self-harm,"" ""death,"" or ""dying."" The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is the closest, implying a fleeting thought of not wanting to be alive, but it's immediately qualified (""don't always wish to be gone"") and not a direct expression of wanting to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness."" These indicate significant emotional distress, despair, and loneliness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No. The post mentions past hardships (""dragged my face through the muds of life,"" ""experiencing some of the worst things"") but not past suicide attempts or self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct, strong expressions. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is a qualified, indirect mention, indicating that sometimes the thought crosses their mind, but it's not a clear or consistent desire to die. The overall tone is one of profound distress and loneliness rather than explicit suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post primarily describes current feelings (""I'm not ok,"" ""all I feel is that somber loneliness"") and past experiences of hardship. There are no expressed future intentions of self-harm or suicide. The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" refers to a general, qualified state of mind, not a current or future intention.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses significant emotional pain, loneliness, and a sense of being overwhelmed by life. However, it explicitly lacks direct, explicit suicidal expression, plans, or mentions of past attempts/behavior.
    *   The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" is the only potential hint of suicidal ideation, but it is very mild and qualified (""don't always""), and the post also contains elements of resilience (""somehow I'm still standing,"" ""I know how precious that is"") and a plea for connection (""I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading"").
    *   Given the lack of explicit suicidal expression or intent, and the presence of resilience and a desire for connection despite profound distress, the post best fits the 'indicator' category. It indicates distress but not explicit suicidal risk as defined by the other categories.

I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Work is killing me"" (metaphorical, but contributes to despair), ""Suicide becoming more enticing"", ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life"", ""end myself"", ""best I head out before it gets worse"", ""the fuck am I getting up in the morning for?"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""Nothing is happening in my life"", ""Nothing is happening and I don't believe my environment facilitates forward moment"", ""stagnant""), despair, feeling trapped (""can't quit"", ""can't stop working""), physical exhaustion/pain (""destroyed my body"", ""body is not getting enough time to even recover"").

    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. Phrases like ""Suicide becoming more enticing"", ""take my own life"", and ""end myself"" are explicit.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The user states ""Suicide becoming more enticing"" and ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life"", indicating a consideration of ending their life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?

There are no mentions of past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Suicide becoming more enticing"", ""take my own life"", ""end myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, nor any signs of preparation. This rules out 'behavior' which requires a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". While the user is considering suicide, they do not express an immediate ""tendency to act out"" or a concrete plan.
    *   There is no mention of any past or recent suicide attempts. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   The post fits the definition of 'ideation' because it has explicit suicidal expression but lacks a concrete plan or an immediate tendency to act on the thoughts. The user is contemplating suicide as a potential future action if circumstances don't change, rather than describing an active plan or immediate intent.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I just slit my wrists"", ""my death will only benefit people"", ""wont have much time to live"", ""Goodbye"". This clearly indicates self-harm and suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: ""so distant to everyone"", ""not a good person"", ""want to get it over with"". These show despair, self-loathing, and a desire for the situation to end.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I looked at many different pictures and graphs of where the radial artery is. i marked where the my artery should be and i Took my dremel and put the saw atachment on and followed the lines."" This is a very detailed description of preparation and method.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit past attempts are mentioned, but ""it took me years o decide this"" indicates long-term suicidal ideation leading up to the current action.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through the act of ""slit my wrists"", the phrase ""my death"", and ""wont have much time to live"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""my death will only benefit people"", ""want to get it over with"", ""Goodbye"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""slit my wrists"" using a ""dremel and put the saw atachment on"" targeting the ""radial artery"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""looked at many different pictures and graphs"", ""marked where the my artery should be"".

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The key phrase ""I just slit my wrists"" is in the past tense, indicating a very recent completed action. ""I typed this out before and will post it once i have done it"" and ""if you are seeing this then its already too late"" confirm that the act has already taken place just prior to the post. This is a description of a recent event.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly states ""I just slit my wrists"" which is a direct description of a self-harm act with suicidal intent that has *just occurred*. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'attempt', which covers ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt"". The detailed method and preparation further support the severity and intent behind the described action.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself. Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself."" It also mentions a friend who is ""suicidal.""

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, for the person writing the post.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm suicidal myself"", ""I don't want to keep going myself"").
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or any indication of a tendency to act on these thoughts. The focus is on the internal conflict and the struggle of supporting a friend while experiencing similar feelings.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself""), so it is not 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*. The statement ""If I become worse and do something bad or kill myself"" is a conditional future statement, not a description of a past attempt or an immediate plan/tendency.
   - The definition of 'ideation' is ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This aligns perfectly with the post's content. While there's a conditional mention of acting out, it lacks the specificity of a plan or immediate tendency required for 'behavior'.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of"" implies that means were considered or available and subsequently removed, which is a sign of preparation or a perceived risk of acting. The phrase ""I could do it right now"" indicates a perceived immediate capability or tendency to act, despite the lack of named specific means.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': Ruled out due to explicit suicidal expression.
    *   'ideation': While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post goes beyond mere ideation. The phrase ""I could do it right now"" indicates a strong *tendency* or immediate capability to act, even if fear is preventing it. The parents' action of ""taken any means they can think of"" also points to a perceived risk of *behavior* by others.
    *   'behavior': This category states ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post clearly has explicit suicidal expression. The statement ""I could do it right now"" strongly indicates a *tendency* to act, and the mention of parents removing ""means"" implies a previous consideration or perceived risk of acting out. This fits the ""tendency to act out"" criterion.
    *   'attempt': Ruled out as no recent or historical attempt is mentioned.

Based on the strong *tendency* to act (""I could do it right now"") and the implication of means being removed due to perceived risk, the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate fit.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""I want to kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to die"", ""no point in me being alive"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The post explicitly states that fear of death is preventing action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I want to die"", ""I want to kill myself"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die"", ""I want to kill myself"").
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act out. In fact, the post explicitly states that the fear of death is the only thing keeping the person alive, indicating a lack of immediate intent or tendency to commit suicide.
   - There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - This aligns with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm better off dead.""
    *   Emotional indicators: ""Nothing feels right,"" ""broken human being,"" ""My being in itself is a prison,"" ""cause anguish and pain,"" ""Can't stand this anymore."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I'm better off dead.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I'm better off dead"" and ""Can't stand this anymore"" refer to current feelings and a desire for a future state (death).
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    Based on the analysis:
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm better off dead""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for self-harm or suicide. This rules out 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.

As in, my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself"", ""killing myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: Past ""desperate"", ""extraordinarily painful"". Current state is positive: ""I'm still here"", ""made the decision to live"", ""no longer as desperate"", ""light at the end of the tunnel is almost here"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""my letters were written"", ""had a set plan which I was days away from going through with"". These refer to past preparations.
   - References to past attempts: The post describes coming ""extraordinarily close"" and having a ""set plan"" that was *not* carried out (""I keep living past that date""). This indicates past planning/preparation, not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""killing myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post explicitly states the opposite: ""I made the decision to live"", ""I'm still here"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, substance) is mentioned, but significant preparation is described: ""my letters were written"", ""had a set plan"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""my letters were written"" and ""had a set plan which I was days away from going through with."" These refer to past preparations.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The detailed planning (""letters were written"", ""set plan"", ""days away from going through with"") refers to past events. The current state is one of resolution and overcoming: ""I'm still here and I made the decision to live."", ""Now my situation is no longer as desperate as it once was.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, the post describes coming ""extraordinarily close"" to an attempt and having a plan, but explicitly states these plans were not carried out (""I keep living past that date"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (past intent and planning: ""came extraordinarily close to killing myself"", ""had a set plan"").
   - It also explicitly states resolved suicidal issues: ""I'm still here and I made the decision to live."", ""Now my situation is no longer as desperate as it once was.""
   - The 'indicator' category definition states: ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression *or* has explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" Since the post has ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues"", it fits the 'indicator' category.
   - The 'behavior' category definition states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression *and* there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or* mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post describes past explicit suicidal expression and detailed historical planning/preparation (""letters were written"", ""set plan""), which fits the criteria for 'behavior'.
   - This presents an ambiguity as the post fits both 'indicator' (due to resolution) and 'behavior' (due to detailed past planning/preparation). However, the 'indicator' category specifically accommodates posts with ""explicit expression of resolved suicidal issues."" Given that the primary message of the post is about overcoming a past crisis and making a decision to live, the current state of resolution is paramount. The details of past planning serve to contextualize the journey to resolution, rather than indicating a current risk. In risk assessment, if a user explicitly states resolution, the current risk level is considered lower.

And I'm angry that it would be considered selfish by so many",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The phrases ""not doing it years ago,"" ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" and ""just done it the first time I thought about it"" all strongly imply suicidal thoughts and the act of suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm angry at myself,"" ""angry that it would be considered selfish."" This indicates significant distress and a sense of being trapped or misunderstood.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post explicitly states ""not doing it years ago"" and ""just done it the first time I thought about it,"" which means the person *did not* attempt suicide. Instead, they express regret for *not* having acted on past suicidal thoughts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, through phrases like ""not doing it"" and ""just done it"" in the context of wanting to be dead.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""wished I wasn't alive"" and ""wanted things to be over.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It primarily refers to past and ongoing *thoughts* and *wishes* (""since about 2012,"" ""years ago,"" ""first time I thought about it""). It expresses regret for *not* having acted in the past, rather than a current intention or plan to act. There is no mention of current intent to commit suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" regret for ""not doing it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a current plan or tendency to commit suicide, nor is there a description of a past self-harm behavior or suicide attempt. The regret is about *not* having acted on past thoughts.
    *   The persistent wishing to not be alive and wanting things to be over since 2012, combined with regret for *not* having ended things, clearly falls under the definition of suicidal ideation – explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to commit suicide, or a past attempt/behavior.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicide"", ""wanting to die"", ""depressed and suicidal"", ""killing myself"", ""get ready to die"", ""dead"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed"", ""sucks so much"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine"" (this is a clear preparation/suicide note). ""get ready to die"" suggests readiness to act.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"", ""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""still wanting to die"", ""get ready to die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, location) is mentioned.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine"" is a significant sign of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current intentions and preparations (""I'm depressed and suicidal"", ""I have past the point where i have written a note"", ""everytime i think about killing myself"", ""get ready to die"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal"", ""wanting to die""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond just ideation by mentioning a concrete step of preparation: ""written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine"". This constitutes a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The phrase ""get ready to die"" further reinforces this tendency.
   - There is no mention of a past or recent *attempt*, only preparation for one. Therefore, 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - Based on the explicit suicidal expression and the clear sign of preparation/plan (the suicide note) and tendency to act, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category.

They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The primary focus is on current contemplation and future intentions (""I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life,"" ""the emotional pain that I will cause future people... is not worth my current existence,"" ""I want to check I'm making the right decision""). There is a reference to past self-harm (""never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression and no clear plan, the post also mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone"" implies damage to self/property when alone). This pushes it beyond simple ideation.
    *   **behavior:** The post *has explicit suicidal expression* (""end my own life,"" ""suicide,"" ""killing myself"") AND it *mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour* (""never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone,"" which implies self-inflicted damage to self or property). This perfectly matches the second part of the 'behavior' definition.
    *   **attempt:** Incorrect, as no recent or historical suicide attempts are mentioned.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression combined with the mention of past self-harm, the 'behavior' category is the most appropriate fit.

I won't ever be happy in this world and how it is now. Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure. I'm from the UK, so i can't get hold of a gun which would solve everything. Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I don't want it anymore"", ""my thoughts always just come back to this"", ""won't ever be happy in this world"", ""solve everything"" (referring to a gun), ""end it all"", ""don't want to be here"". These phrases strongly indicate suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm so tired"", ""hopelessness"", ""despair"", ""Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions ""a gun which would solve everything"". While stating they *can't* get one, the specific mention of a method and the desire for it is present. Also, ""Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?"" indicates a search for or desire for a method.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, phrases like ""end it all"", ""don't want to be here"", and ""a gun which would solve everything"" are explicit references to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want it anymore"", ""don't want to be here"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""a gun"". The user is lamenting the inability to access this method. The question about ""a good option for us to end it all"" also implies a search for a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation, but the active contemplation and desire for a specific method (even if unobtainable) points towards a tendency.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions and ongoing struggle (""I don't want it anymore"", ""I won't ever be happy"", ""end it all"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""ideation"").
   - It goes beyond simple ideation by mentioning a specific method (""a gun"") and expressing a desire for ""a good option for us to end it all."" This indicates a ""tendency to act out"" if means were available, or an active search for means. This aligns with the 'behavior' category which states ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The user is not just thinking about suicide, but actively considering *how* to do it and expressing frustration about the lack of accessible means.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not. I believe in God but sometimes he feels so far away. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to.,1,ideation,"<thinking>

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself."" ""I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself""

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times, ""die prematurely,"" ""end my life,"" and ""wanting to end my life."" The author discusses suicide as a ""solution"" and a ""means of escape.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys a sense of conviction about suicide as a personal choice, frustration with societal stigma, and a feeling of being unheard (""No one is really listening to any of us,"" ""There is no support""). The author states, ""I'm tired from working another long shift last night,"" but this seems to be a concluding remark about their current physical state, not the primary emotional driver for the suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There are no specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) mentioned. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts or self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, repeatedly and directly.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. The author includes themselves among ""those people... who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives."" They state, ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it."" and ""talking about wanting to end my life.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post discusses current beliefs and a strong future intention (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life""). It frames suicide as a future ""solution"" and a ""personal decision.""
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** This category requires ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" The post *does* have explicit suicidal expression. However, the statement ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it"" indicates a strong *tendency* or firm intent, which contradicts the ""no tendency to commit suicide"" part of the 'ideation' definition.
    *   **behavior:** This category requires ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post has explicit suicidal expression. While there is no specific plan or historical behavior mentioned, the phrase ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it"" strongly conveys a ""tendency to act out"" or a firm intent to commit suicide. This goes beyond passive ideation and suggests a strong resolve for future action, fitting the ""tendency to act out"" part of the 'behavior' definition.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out, as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    Based on the definitions, particularly the distinction regarding ""tendency to commit suicide"" between 'ideation' and 'behavior', the strong statement of intent in the post (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it"") places it in the 'behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""cutting"" and ""self harm"" multiple times. It describes a past incident where the user ""used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain"" by self-harming, which resulted in visible injury (""she saw my arm and freaked out""). The user also states, ""I've had issues with self harm in the past"" and ""Btw theres about a dozen scars."" The phrase ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" indicates suicidal ideation.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired"", ""numb and empty inside"", ""pain"", ""cried myself to sleep"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan or method for *suicide* is mentioned by the poster. ""Cutting"" is mentioned as a method for *self-harm*.

This is a historical experience of self-harm behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, indirectly through ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore,"" which is a clear expression of questioning the value of life, indicating suicidal ideation.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" strongly implies this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** For suicide, no. For self-harm, yes (""cutting"").
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No, not for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

        *   Past events: The post clearly describes a ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside... used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."").
        *   Current intentions: ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" refers to current suicidal ideation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains ""explicit suicidal expression"" (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"").
    *   Crucially, it also ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."").
    *   According to the definitions, the 'behavior' category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*.""
    *   The described past incident is self-harm, not a suicide attempt, as the stated intent was to ""relieve some of the pain.""

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No explicit suicide *plan* or *method* (e.g., ""I will jump off a bridge,"" ""I will take pills""). However, daily heroin use is mentioned, which is a severe self-harming behavior that can be lethal. The user does not frame heroin use as a direct suicide method, but as an ongoing self-destructive action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. There is a mention of past negative experience with anti-psychotics, but not a past suicide attempt.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

The heroin use is current and ongoing (""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily""). The forced institutionalization is a future event (within 4 weeks) that is causing distress. Past experience with anti-psychotics is mentioned.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** This is incorrect as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post goes beyond mere thoughts. The user is actively engaging in a severe self-harming behavior (daily heroin use) which, coupled with the death wishes, indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm.""
    *   **behavior:** This category requires ""explicit suicidal expression *and* there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   Explicit suicidal expression: Yes (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead"").
        *   Plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide: The daily heroin use is a clear and ongoing ""self-harm behaviour."" This active, self-destructive behavior, combined with the desire for death, fits the ""tendency to act out self-harm"" criterion.

    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The question ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem"" is a direct inquiry about the practical execution of a specific method, indicating a clear tendency or preparation to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** This refers to current and future intentions. The question ""What position... is best"" implies a present consideration for a future action.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I don't care... I genuinely do not care,"" and the implied intent to die by gun).
    *   Crucially, it goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""gun"") and asking for specific technical details about its execution (""What position... is best for hitting the brain stem""). This demonstrates a clear plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.
    *   There is no mention of a past attempt.
    *   Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category as it covers explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan/tendency to act out.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""thought about killing myself"", ""self harm scars"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""everything just keeps getting worse"", ""nothing to be upset over and i'm dramatic"" (implies despair, invalidation).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific plan or method for suicide is mentioned. Past self-harm is indicated by ""scars"".
   - References to past attempts: No explicit suicide attempt is mentioned. Past self-harm is mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""thought about killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""thought about killing myself"", ""it wont leave my head"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for suicide.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, not for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head."" indicates ongoing, current suicidal ideation. ""my mum saw my self harm scars"" refers to a past event of self-harm.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No suicide attempts are described. Past self-harm is mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression (""thought about killing myself""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - While there is no *plan to commit suicide*, the post explicitly mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""my self harm scars"").
   - The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*.""
   - The post fits both the ""explicit suicidal expression"" and the ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" criteria for the 'behavior' category.
   - It does not describe a recent or historical *suicide attempt*, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.
   - 'Ideation' is too narrow as it explicitly excludes a ""plan or tendency to commit suicide"" and doesn't account for historical self-harm as 'behavior' does.

    *   There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   The phrase ""Let's just do it"" strongly indicates a *tendency to act out* self-harm or suicide, even without a detailed plan. This goes beyond mere ideation (thinking about it) and suggests an immediate impulse or readiness to act.
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'ideation' is ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
        *   'behavior' is ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
    *   The presence of ""Let's just do it"" fulfills the ""tendency to act out"" criterion for the 'behavior' category.

My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm going to attempt again"", ""I want to die"", ""people only care when your dead"", ""mind that wants to die"", ""Goodbye"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""so tired"", ""hate every little thing about myself"", ""terrifying"", ""pain, the loneliness"", ""give up"", ""My body has lost the fight and my mind has won"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Just a few more hours. Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again."", ""tried to overdose three times"".
   - References to past attempts: ""My first attempt at the beginning of this year"", ""tried to overdose three times since I've got out"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""attempt again"", ""first attempt"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I want to die"", ""I don't want to live in anymore"", ""mind that wants to die"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""overdose"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""Just a few more hours"" indicates a time-bound intention to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. The post explicitly mentions ""My first attempt at the beginning of this year"" and ""tried to overdose three times since I've got out"" (past attempts). It also states ""Just a few more hours... I'm going to attempt again"" (current/future intention).
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""first attempt"" and ""tried to overdose three times"".

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression and a clear intention to act (""I'm going to attempt again"" with a timeframe ""Just a few more hours""). This points towards 'behavior' or 'attempt'.
   - Crucially, the post explicitly mentions ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year"" and ""tried to overdose three times since I've got out"". The definition for 'attempt' includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"". Overdosing with the intent to end one's life is a suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, the presence of explicit historical suicide attempts directly aligns with the 'attempt' category. The current intention to ""attempt again"" further reinforces this.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" strongly implies a desire to cease existing or die as a means to escape overwhelming suffering.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned by the user about themselves. (The mother's condition is not a reference to the user's past attempt).

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" in the context of such severe distress is a strong, explicit (though indirect) expression of wanting to die or cease to exist.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current overwhelming pain and a present desire (""I just want this pain to end""). It refers to past traumatic events and ongoing difficult circumstances that contribute to the current state.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No, not by the user about themselves.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to end suffering, which in this context is a form of suicidal expression (""I just want this pain to end"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation to act on this desire.
   - There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts by the user.
   - This fits the definition of 'ideation' because there is explicit suicidal expression but no plan or tendency to commit suicide (i.e., no actionable plan or intent to carry it out).

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me.

I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society.

I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry.

   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't know what's wrong with me."", ""I'm sorry to the people i know in advance.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Mentions a *conditional* timing (""at 30 or 25""), but no specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) or immediate preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""killing myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""Adios i can't. It's not worth it."", ""this life for me isn't it."").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The mention of ages 25/30 is a future, conditional timeframe, not a current preparation. The user explicitly states, ""I still have a long time to rethink my decisions. I can still seek out help over the course of the passing years.""

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions, conditional on how they feel at a specific age (25 or 30). It's a long-term consideration, not an immediate one.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""killing myself"", ""this life for me isn't it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' is crucial. 'Behavior' implies a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". While there's a *conditional future plan* (at age 25/30), there is no *immediate* plan or *tendency to act out*. The user explicitly states they ""still have a long time to rethink my decisions"" and ""can still seek out help"". This indicates persistent suicidal thoughts (ideation) but a lack of immediate intent or a concrete, actionable plan to commit suicide. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation' more accurately.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide rate."" The phrase ""teetering on the edge lately"" implies being close to a breaking point, and in the context of the subsequent discussion about suicide, strongly suggests being on the verge of suicidal thoughts or actions.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Teetering on the edge"" indicates severe distress, instability, and being at a critical point.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""suicide rate.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** While not a direct ""I want to die,"" the phrase ""teetering on the edge lately"" when immediately followed by a discussion of ""suicide rate"" serves as an explicit, albeit metaphorical, expression of being on the brink of suicidal ideation or crisis.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" refers to a current, ongoing state of distress.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression through the phrase ""teetering on the edge lately"" contextualized by the mention of ""suicide rate."" This indicates the poster is experiencing significant distress and is close to suicidal thoughts.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act out self-harm/suicide.
    *   There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   It's more than an 'indicator' because ""teetering on the edge"" in this context is a strong, current expression of being on the verge of suicidal thoughts, not a resolved issue or general distress without suicidal undertones.
    *   It fits 'ideation' because there is explicit suicidal expression (being on the edge of suicide) but no plan or clear tendency to commit suicide described in terms of action.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicide is a coward way to go out"", ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Sarcasm (""Thanks mom.""), despair, sadness ("":(""), empathy for others (""I wish the best for you all out here struggling."").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method or tool is mentioned. However, ""gone within 24 hours"" indicates a very specific and imminent timeframe for an action.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""suicide"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours."" directly implies an intention to end their life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No specific preparations are mentioned, but the very short timeframe (""within 24 hours"") indicates a strong tendency to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current/future intentions, specifically very imminent (""within 24 hours"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicide"", ""gone within 24 hours""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because it includes a specific, very short timeframe (""within 24 hours"") for the implied action. This indicates a strong ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide,"" even without a specific method. The imminence suggests a move beyond just thinking about it.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, the explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear and imminent temporal intention to act fits the definition of 'behavior'.

   - However, there is no explicit suicidal expression, no mention of wanting to die, no plans for self-harm or suicide, and no history of such actions.
   - The phrase ""it's killing me"" is a common idiom for intense suffering and does not indicate literal suicidal intent.
   - The user's stated desire is to obtain a restraining order and move out, which are actions aimed at self-preservation and escaping the abusive situation, not self-harm.
   - Based on the definitions, 'indicator' is the correct category as there is ""no explicit suicidal expression.""

332,"Three Days Changes Everything. I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend. It started with an old trigger, then every little problem, every panic attack I had learned to power through, ended with my harming. I swore to my family I could stop, I swore to the love of my life I would stop, I told myself I would stop. Now after four months I'm self harming again. What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""self harm"", ""harming"", ""bloodying myself up"", ""kill myself"", ""suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: Despair, hopelessness, relapse, feeling overwhelmed (""every little problem, every panic attack... ended with my harming""), a sense of inevitability (""It's a matter of time before I kill myself""), and an immediate impulse (""I should do it now and save time"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""bloodying myself up now"" indicates current self-harm behavior. While no specific *suicide* method is detailed, the immediate desire to ""do it now"" suggests a strong tendency to act.
   - References to past attempts: The post explicitly mentions a history of ""self harm"" and a relapse after ""four months without self harm"". This is historical experience of self-harm behavior, not a suicide attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I should do it now and save time"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *suicide* method is mentioned. However, current *self-harm* is described (""bloodying myself up now"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? No explicit preparation for suicide, but the current self-harm and the statement ""I should do it now and save time"" indicate an immediate tendency to act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
     - Past: ""four months without self harm"", ""learned to power through"", ""old trigger"". This describes a history of self-harm.
     - Current: ""Now after four months I'm self harming again"", ""I'm bloodying myself up now"". This describes active self-harm behavior.
     - Future: ""It's a matter of time before I kill myself"", ""I should do it now and save time"". This expresses future suicidal intent and an immediate impulse.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? The post describes a history and current relapse of *self-harm behavior*, not a past *suicide attempt*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"", ""suicide"", ""I should do it now"").
   - It describes current self-harm behavior (""I'm bloodying myself up now"").
   - It mentions a historical experience of self-harm behavior (""four months without self harm, until this weekend"").
   - It expresses a strong tendency to act on suicidal thoughts (""It's a matter of time before I kill myself"", ""I should do it now and save time"").
   - All these elements align perfectly with the definition of the 'behavior' category: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""

I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""someone blow my head off"", ""im fucking done"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me"". The phrase ""before i hurt someone"" could refer to harming others or self-harm, but in the context of ""please kill me"", it leans towards a desperate desire for cessation of suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""im fucking done"", ""tired if these stupidass ignorant people"", ""deserve death"". Strong feelings of despair, hopelessness, self-loathing, and frustration.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""blow my head off"" is a method, but it's phrased as a plea to *someone else* (""someone blow my head off"", ""please kill me""). There are no signs of the poster preparing to act on this themselves.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""blow my head off"", ""deserve death"", ""please kill me"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""im fucking done"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my head off"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The methods are framed as a plea for external action, not a self-initiated plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions/desires (""im fucking done"", ""deserve death"", ""please kill me"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""someone blow my head off"", ""i fucking deserve death"", ""please kill me""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" by the *person writing the post*. While a method (""blow my head off"") is mentioned, it's framed as a plea for *someone else* to act (""someone blow my head off"", ""please kill me""). This indicates a strong desire for death and distress, but not a concrete, self-initiated plan or tendency by the poster to commit suicide. If the post said ""I'm going to blow my head off"" or ""I have a gun and I'm going to do it"", that would fit 'behavior'. As it stands, it's a cry for cessation of life, but without a self-initiated plan or tendency to act.

Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit, as there is explicit suicidal expression but no clear self-initiated plan or tendency to commit suicide described by the poster.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it all"", ""I want to die"", ""if I was gone"", ""hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""failure"", ""can't stand the person looking back at me"", ""despise myself even more"", ""hate myself"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"".
   - References to past attempts: ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"", ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again"".

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""end it all"", ""I want to die"", ""hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"", ""if I was gone"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act of taking the pills with the stated intent is a clear sign of acting on a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to very recent past events (""failed twice in the last 4 days"", ""Yesterday I took...""). It also expresses current suicidal ideation (""I want to die"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the post explicitly describes a recent, unsuccessful suicide attempt (""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"", and the detailed account of taking pills ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post clearly describes a recent, unsuccessful suicide attempt. The phrases ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and the detailed description of taking a large number of pills with the explicit hope of not waking up, followed by the realization of still being alive, directly fit the definition of an 'attempt'.

And of course I can't consoling about it because I know some Petersonain victim blamer is going to come here and tell me to work harder; even though I am doing all the right things.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post uses strong negative language about life (""horrible life"", ""life sucks"", ""total curse"") but does not mention death, dying, or suicide.
   - Note emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, frustration, anger, victimhood, feeling trapped, injustice, isolation. The user feels their life is unfair, they are doing everything right but still suffer, and they are constantly attacked when they complain.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses extreme dissatisfaction with life but not a direct wish to end it.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes ongoing current struggles and past experiences of bullying/harassment. There are no future intentions related to self-harm or suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and negative feelings about life. However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide*, direct expressions of wanting to die, or any plans/methods/past attempts. According to the definitions, 'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression, 'behavior' requires explicit suicidal expression with a plan/tendency or historical self-harm, and 'attempt' requires explicit expression of a recent or historical suicide attempt. Since none of these explicit elements are present, despite the high level of emotional distress, the post falls under 'indicator'.

    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** Yes, ""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute"" and ""the first time I actually attempted.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It describes a specific plan/method (jumping in front of a train) and knowledge of the means (train schedule, proximity to tracks). This points towards 'behavior' or 'attempt'.
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly states ""the first time I actually attempted"" and ""the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks in and i jump away at the last minute."" The definition of 'attempt' includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" This directly matches the content. While there is also current ideation and a plan, the explicit mention of past *attempts* is the strongest classifying factor.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None.
   - Emotional indicators: ""People tell me I'm a burden."" This suggests feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, and potentially despair. The description of a sedentary, isolated lifestyle (""haven't left the house since I was 14,"" ""don't have a job,"" ""still live at home,"" ""lay in bed all day"") indicates severe distress, potential depression, and social withdrawal.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.

   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.

CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post describes significant personal distress, social isolation, and feelings of being a burden, which are risk factors for mental health issues. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, wanting to die, or any plans/attempts. Therefore, it falls under the 'indicator' category, which covers posts with no explicit suicidal expression.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""It's settled"", ""can't anymore"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, implied by ""researching tall bridges"" and ""a few methods to try"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes: ""researching tall bridges"", ""decided to push through the holiday but commit when i get home"" (temporal plan), ""I've already drafted my suicide notes"" (preparation of means).

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions and ongoing preparations: ""decided to push through the holiday but commit when i get home"", ""I have a few methods to try"", ""I've already drafted my suicide notes"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""commit"", ""suicide notes""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post clearly describes a plan (""researching tall bridges"", ""decided to push through the holiday but commit when i get home"") and preparations (""drafted my suicide notes"", ""a few methods to try""). This goes beyond mere 'ideation' which lacks a plan or tendency to commit.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt*. The content describes future intent and current preparation for an act.
   - Therefore, the post fits the 'behavior' category, which is defined as having ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""want to kill myself"", ""I need to kill myself"", ""constantly suicidal"", ""allowed assisted suicide"", ""stay and suffer"".
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme frustration, despair, hopelessness, feeling misunderstood (""How the fuck am I supposed to get better"", ""Seriously?"", ""Fuck."", ""It's all bullshit."", ""People like me are sick."", ""twice as worse to tell me to stay and suffer."").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. The mention of ""assisted suicide"" is a desire for a *type* of method, but not a personal plan or preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. (""want to kill myself"", ""I need to kill myself"", ""constantly suicidal"", ""assisted suicide"").

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expressions, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan (e.g., how, when, where) or a tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. The desire for ""assisted suicide"" is a wish for a facilitated end, not a personal action plan.
   - There is no mention of a recent suicide attempt or historical experience of self-harm or suicide attempt, ruling out 'behavior' (for historical self-harm) and 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'ideation' as it has explicit suicidal expression but no concrete plan or tendency to act.

All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:**

        *   ""My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it."" (explicit mention of suicide, current suicidal urge)
        *   ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" (describes past self-harm/suicidal actions)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Lonely,"" ""constantly feeling alone,"" ""didn't really make much friends,"" ""felt that the only reason they play with me...was just for my brother,"" ""no one didn't really want to be my friend,"" ""friends that I made just drifted away,"" ""I just don't fit in,"" ""they would just be better off without me there,"" ""I feel like an inconvenience,"" ""I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it."" (Strong feelings of isolation, low self-worth, despair, and self-criticism).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""knife to my wrist"" is a specific method mentioned in the context of past actions. The current ideation of ""seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood"" implies a method like cutting.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This clearly describes past actions taken with suicidal intent, even if the attempts were not completed (i.e., no injury occurred). The act of placing a knife to the wrist with the intent to cut is an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead,"" ""I feel like I just need to do it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""knife to my wrist"" (in past actions) and implied cutting/bleeding out (current imagery).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The past actions of ""had a knife to my wrist 3x"" indicate preparation and initiation of a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to past events (""When I was in kinder..."", ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life"") and current/future intentions (""I'm Lonely... I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead... I feel like I just need to do it."").
    *   Past attempts are specifically described: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This is a historical experience of an attempted suicide/self-harm, even if not completed.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I feel like I just need to do it"") and describes a specific method (implied cutting, and past actions with a knife). Most importantly, the statement ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut"" directly describes a ""historical experience of suicide attempt."" While the attempts were not completed (no injury), the action of placing the knife to the wrist with suicidal intent constitutes an attempt. This fits the definition of the 'attempt' category.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, implied by the word ""again"", indicating a historical experience of a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""end myself"", ""end it""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific plan/method (""overdose"") and an immediate timeframe (""tonight"").
    *   The phrase ""end myself again"" directly indicates a historical experience of a *suicide attempt*.
    *   Comparing 'behavior' and 'attempt':
        *   'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*."" The post fits the first part (plan/tendency). While ""end myself"" could be seen as self-harm, it's more accurately a suicide attempt.
        *   'attempt' includes ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, *or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*."" The ""again"" clearly points to a ""historical experience of suicide attempt"".
    *   Given that the post explicitly mentions a past *suicide attempt* (""again""), the 'attempt' category is the most precise and highest-risk classification, even though there's also a current plan. The presence of a past suicide attempt is a critical factor in the 'attempt' category.

These are clear expressions of impending death, implied to be self-induced.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I can't fight anymore, I can't try anymore,"" ""so tired that your eyelids feel as heavy as boulders, that's how I feel with life and its pain,"" ""tortured soul."" These indicate profound hopelessness, exhaustion, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned. No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described. The timeframe ""in the next month or two"" is mentioned, but not linked to a specific action. The cat analogy describes a passive withdrawal, not an active method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** While the word ""suicide"" is not used, the phrases ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" and ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die by their own hand, indicating suicidal ideation.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, clearly.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to current feelings and a perceived future intention/outcome (""coming to an end in the next month or two"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""My death will release my pain""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, nor any concrete signs of preparation or a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" in terms of a defined action. The timeframe ""next month or two"" indicates a perceived end, but not a plan for *how* that end will occur through a specific suicidal act. The analogy of a dying cat suggests a passive decline rather than an active, planned suicide attempt.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds .

352,Even when the 'fog' has lifted I still have no interest in modern life. I get windows of relief which is nice.but yet suicidal thoughts constantly round and round. I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day. What's really worrying is I'm 26 now and each year has got worse yes there's lots of factors but there's levels of depression I didn't think we're possible.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""no interest in modern life,"" ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible,"" ""worrying.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user states, ""I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day."" While no *specific* method is named, the constant contemplation of *methods* is a significant indicator. No signs of preparation are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly through ""suicidal thoughts"" and the contemplation of methods.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping"") is mentioned. However, the phrase ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" indicates a strong and constant mental engagement with the *means* of suicide.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The language (""constantly round and round,"" ""over 100 times a day"") clearly refers to current and ongoing intentions/preoccupations.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts""), the definition for 'ideation' states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" The phrase ""contemplate method over 100 times a day"" goes beyond simple ideation. It indicates a persistent and intense mental engagement with the *how* of suicide, which suggests a stronger inclination towards action than mere thoughts.
    *   **behavior:** This category requires ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" The explicit suicidal expression is present. The constant and frequent contemplation of ""method over 100 times a day"" strongly suggests a ""tendency to act out."" While it's not a concrete plan (like ""I will use X on Y date""), this intense mental rehearsal of *how* to commit suicide indicates a significant step beyond passive ideation and points towards a strong inclination or preoccupation with the mechanics of suicide, which is a precursor to a plan or action. It implies a strong mental push towards action.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out, as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    Based on the intense and frequent contemplation of methods, the post indicates a strong ""tendency to act out,"" aligning it with the 'behavior' category.

So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post states, ""I wake up even more tired of living."" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" These are strong indicators of a desire to end their life or current state of suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with expressions of intense emotional distress: ""My mind is hell,"" ""losing"" (a mental battle), ""painful,"" ""Nothing, nothing changes,"" ""worse thoughts each time,"" ""eating my mind,"" ""tear me down every night,"" ""stupid for falling this low,"" ""weak,"" ""hopeless."" This indicates severe despair and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase ""stop it"" is vague regarding the method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors are explicitly described.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** The word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""I wake up even more tired of living"" and ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" are direct expressions of a desire to end their current state of existence/suffering, strongly implying a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.

The phrase ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" clearly indicates a future intention or a sense of urgency about ending their suffering.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""tired of living,"" ""don't have much time left before I have to stop it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on ""plan or tendency to commit suicide"" vs. ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
    *   While no specific *plan* or *method* is detailed, the phrase ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" conveys a strong sense of urgency and a nearing limit to endurance, implying an impending action. This constitutes a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide,"" even without a specified method. It goes beyond mere thoughts or desires to a declared impending action.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'behavior' category due to the explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear ""tendency to act out"" as indicated by the urgent declaration of a nearing deadline.

I want this to end but I am scared.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""I don't want to bail out anymore"" (implies not wanting to stop trying to end life), ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" (past self-harm/suicide attempt), ""I have a rope."" (means for suicide), ""I have to do it."", ""I should've done it a long time ago."" (strong intent to commit suicide), ""I want this to end"" (desire for life to end).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hate myself so much."", ""I am scared."" (despair, self-loathing, fear).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""tried with a knife"" (past method), ""I have a rope"" (current means), ""There's a building"" (considering a location).
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times."", ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through direct statements of intent (""I have to do it"", ""I should've done it a long time ago"") and descriptions of past actions (""tried with a knife"") and current means (""have a rope"") clearly in the context of ending life.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want this to end"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""knife"" (past), ""rope"" (current).
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have a rope"" (acquiring means). ""There's a building"" (considering a location).

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times."" and ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" refer to past events/attempts. ""I don't want to bail out anymore."", ""I have a rope."", ""I have to do it."" refer to current intent and future intentions.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" and ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times."" clearly describe past suicide attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It mentions specific methods and means (""rope"").
    *   Crucially, it explicitly describes ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" with phrases like ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times"" and ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This directly matches the definition for the 'attempt' category. While there are elements of 'behavior' (current plan/tendency), the presence of past attempts makes 'attempt' the most accurate and highest risk classification based on the provided definitions.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end it"" (implies ending life), ""No point to anything in life"", ""useless"", ""A fly is worth more than i am"" (extreme self-devaluation suggesting a desire not to exist).
   - Emotional indicators: ""Tired of it"", ""depression"", ""feel pain"", ""useless"", ""most useless pos known to mankind"". These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and self-loathing.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end it"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life. ""No point to anything in life"" also strongly implies a desire not to continue living.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and intentions (""I feel pain and i just want to end it"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I just want to end it"", ""No point to anything in life"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or tendency to act out self-harm/suicide.
   - There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - The issues are not resolved.
   - This fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" (desire for death), ""attempt properly again"" (explicit mention of past suicide attempt and potential future one).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Tired of being alone"", ""depressed enough"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan or method is mentioned for immediate action. The ""attempt properly again"" is conditional on future events (""Christmas probably won't be happening this year"").
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""attempt properly again"" is an explicit reference to suicide. ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?**
        *   ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" refers to a current wish for the immediate future.
        *   ""Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" refers to a potential future intention, conditional on an event.
        *   ""attempt properly again"" explicitly refers to a *past* attempt that the user might repeat.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"").
    *   Crucially, the post states ""attempt properly again,"" which directly refers to a ""historical experience of suicide attempt.""
    *   According to the definitions:
        *   'indicator': Does not fit, as there is explicit suicidal expression and a past attempt.
        *   'ideation': While there is ideation, the mention of a past attempt goes beyond mere ideation.
        *   'behavior': This category includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While a suicide attempt is a form of self-harm behavior, the 'attempt' category specifically covers ""historical experience of suicide attempt.""
        *   'attempt': This category is defined as ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The phrase ""attempt properly again"" perfectly matches the ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"" part of this definition.

    *   Therefore, the mention of a past suicide attempt is the strongest classifying factor here.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill me"", ""never get found again"", ""chop me up"", ""harvest my organs"". These are direct expressions of wanting to die and have one's body disposed of.
   - Emotional indicators: The request itself indicates extreme despair or a desire to end life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is ""looking for someone to kill me"" and explicitly details the methods: ""hide my body"", ""chop me up"", ""harvest my organs"". This is a detailed request for a method of ending life and body disposal.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""looking for someone to kill me"", ""never get found again"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""kill me"", ""hide my body"", ""chop me up"", ""harvest my organs"". These are specific actions requested to achieve death and disappearance.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The post is a direct request for someone to perform these actions, indicating an active search for a means to end life.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions: ""i am looking for someone to kill me"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill me"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation because the user is actively ""looking for someone"" to carry out the act and provides detailed methods (""kill me"", ""hide my body"", ""chop me up"", ""harvest my organs""). This demonstrates a clear ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" by seeking external assistance and detailing the desired actions. It does not mention a past attempt. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""fantasizing about my death"", ""desire to die"", ""consider it"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""fed up"", ""fighting down"", ""rock bottom lows"", ""fed up with fighting this crap"".

    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""fantasizing about my death"", ""some days I consider it"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a long-term (10 years) and ongoing struggle (""Every fucking day"", ""some days I consider it""). It refers to current thoughts and feelings.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts"", ""fantasizing about my death"", ""some days I consider it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method, nor any signs of preparation. This rules out 'behavior' based on a 'plan'.
    *   The post explicitly states, ""I have no desire to die"" and ""Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here."" This strongly indicates that there is no *tendency to commit suicide* despite the presence of suicidal thoughts and fantasies. The ""consider it"" is framed as a thought arising from being ""fed up"" with the struggle, not an inclination towards action. This aligns with the 'ideation' definition which specifies ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"".
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt. This rules out 'attempt'.

    Therefore, the post describes explicit suicidal ideation (thoughts, fantasies, consideration) but explicitly negates a desire or tendency to act on them, fitting the 'ideation' category.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" expresses a strong desire to escape the current painful experience. While it conveys immense suffering and a wish for it to stop, it is not an *explicit* statement of wanting to die or end one's life (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" ""I can't go on living""). It refers to ""this"" specific painful experience, not life in general.

    *   However, it lacks explicit suicidal expression. The statement ""I don't want to live this again"" refers to the specific painful experience rather than a direct desire to end life. It does not meet the ""explicit suicidal expression"" criteria for 'ideation'.
    *   There is no mention of a plan, method, or historical self-harm/attempt.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""No point in it all"", ""push me over the edge"", ""wasn't meant for this world"", ""question what the point of moving on is"", ""don't really see a future for myself"", ""free from it all"", ""eternal void"", ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hate being trapped in limbo"", ""disappointing"", ""sick"", ""view of the world is growing more and more dim"", ""truly happy"" (lack thereof).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method or tool is mentioned. However, ""I need something to really push me over the edge"" and ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all"" indicate a strong desire for an active step towards ending life, and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" suggests a desire to hasten death.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. Phrases like ""No point in it all"", ""wasn't meant for this world"", ""don't really see a future for myself"", ""free from it all"", ""eternal void"", ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" clearly express a desire for death/non-existence. ""Push me over the edge"" and ""One last push is all I need"" imply a desire for self-initiated action leading to death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) are mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation are mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings and future intentions/desires (""I need something to really push me over the edge"", ""I won't get anywhere"", ""I'm really starting to question"", ""I don't really see a future"", ""I'm just going to keep disappointing"", ""One last push is all I need"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and not wanting to continue living. This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a past or recent suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' is crucial here. 'Ideation' implies explicit suicidal expression *but no plan or tendency to commit suicide*. 'Behavior' implies explicit suicidal expression *and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide*.
    *   While no specific plan is detailed, the phrases ""I need something to really push me over the edge"", ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all"", and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" strongly suggest a *tendency to act out* or a readiness to take a final, active step towards ending life. This goes beyond passive contemplation and indicates a desire for an active intervention to achieve death, fitting the ""tendency to act out"" criterion of the 'behavior' category.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""People who commit suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: ""painful emotions"", ""bottled everything up"", ""snap and break down"" describe the general emotional state that *leads* people to suicide, not necessarily the author's current state or suicidal intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""People who commit suicide"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post is a general commentary on the reasons people commit suicide, not a personal expression of suicidal desire or intent from the author.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a general understanding of *why* people commit suicide (""Most of the time people get to that place because...""). It's a commentary on the general experience, not a personal declaration of current or future intent, nor a description of past actions by the author.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post discusses suicide in a general, explanatory context. It does not contain any explicit suicidal expression *from the author* (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I am going to kill myself""), nor does it mention any personal plans, tendencies, or past attempts. The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post"". Since the post is a general observation about suicide and not a personal expression of suicidal ideation or behavior, it falls under 'indicator'.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill their self"", ""end their pain"".
    *   Emotional indicators: ""end their pain"" suggests suffering and a desire to alleviate it.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.
    *   Key phrases: ""If someone wants to kill their self..."", ""(Asking for a personal reason)"". The ""personal reason"" strongly implies the hypothetical question relates to the user's own thoughts or feelings.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill their self"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly, through the question ""If someone wants to kill their self for whatever reason Maybe to end their pain why do people stop them?"" combined with ""(Asking for a personal reason)"". This indicates the user is personally contemplating or grappling with the idea of wanting to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current contemplation or hypothetical consideration (""If someone wants...""), but the ""personal reason"" makes it current for the user. It does not describe past events or attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains ""explicit suicidal expression"" (""wants to kill their self"" and ""end their pain"" linked to a ""personal reason"").
    *   However, there is ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"" explicitly stated. The user is asking a question about the *idea* of suicide and intervention, not stating an intent to act or detailing a method.
    *   It does not mention historical experience of self-harm behavior or any suicide attempts.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'ideation': explicit suicidal expression without a plan or tendency to act.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal"", ""jumping in and drowning"", ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", ""put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressed"", ""faking everything I do"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"", ""put neck on the train tracks"". The user is also asking about the effectiveness of a specific method (""will it instantly kill me"").
    *   **References to past attempts:** The user describes a past incident at age 10 or 11 where they ""thought jumping in and drowning"" but were ""convince me not to."" This indicates a past *tendency* or *ideation with a plan*, but not a completed *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""suicidal"", ""suicide by a train"".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, implied by the detailed planning and questioning about a method's lethality.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""jumping in and drowning"" (past consideration), and currently ""suicide by a train"", ""put neck on the train tracks"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" and asking about the effectiveness of the method (""will it instantly kill me"") indicates seeking information for a future action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?**
        *   Past: The incident at the lake at age 10 or 11 refers to a past *tendency* or *ideation with a plan* that was not carried out.
        *   Current/Future: ""Now I'm 16 depressed..."", ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", ""I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"", ""I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"". This clearly indicates current thoughts and a specific future plan.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No. The lake incident was a thought/plan that was not executed, so it does not qualify as an ""attempt"" based on the definition.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   ""indicator"": Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal expression and a clear plan.
    *   ""ideation"": Incorrect. While there is explicit suicidal expression, there is also a clear plan and a tendency to act (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"", ""suicide by a train is on my mind"", asking about method effectiveness).
    *   ""behavior"": This category states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   Explicit suicidal expression: Yes.
        *   Plan or tendency to act out suicide: Yes, ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" and the detailed method description (""suicide by a train"", ""put neck on the train tracks"") strongly indicate a plan and tendency to act.
        *   Mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour: The past mention of the lake incident, while not an attempt, does describe a historical *tendency* or *thought* of acting out, which aligns with the ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" part of the definition, even if not fully executed. The current plan is the primary factor for this classification.
    *   ""attempt"": Incorrect. There is no mention of a *recent* suicide attempt, nor a *historical experience of a completed suicide attempt*. The past incident was not carried out.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression, detailed future plan, and current tendency to act, ""behavior"" is the most fitting category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""tried to end his life"" (referring to someone else), ""keep thinking about it,"" ""it's now ok to try"" (referring to self).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""rougher weeks,"" ""can't really explain why I feel like this,"" ""don't want to think like this anymore.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned for the user.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The user mentions ""I´ve had some suicidal thoughts through my life,"" but clarifies these are ""thoughts,"" not attempts. An attempt by ""someone else"" is mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts,"" and the phrase ""it's now ok to try"" directly relates to suicide for the user.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly, but the phrase ""it's now ok to try"" implies a current consideration of suicide. The user also expresses a desire *not* to have these thoughts (""I just don´t want to think like this anymore"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to past ""suicidal thoughts"" but emphasizes a current struggle (""lately,"" ""since then I keep thinking about it,"" ""opens a window for me that it's now ok to try""). It describes a present shift in the user's perception of suicide.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, only past *thoughts* by the user. The attempt mentioned was by someone else.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""it's now ok to try,"" ""keep thinking about it""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. This rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt' based on current intent/action.
    *   The user explicitly mentions past ""suicidal thoughts"" but not past *attempts* or *self-harm behavior*. The attempt was by someone else, which is irrelevant for the user's classification. This rules out 'attempt'.
    *   The core of the post is the user's current struggle with suicidal *thoughts* that have become more ""real"" and ""attainable"" due to an external trigger. The phrase ""it's now ok to try"" signifies a strong form of suicidal ideation, where the idea of suicide is actively being considered as a possibility for themselves. While there's a ""tendency to commit suicide"" implied by the thought, there's no ""plan or tendency to act out"" (meaning concrete steps towards execution). This fits the definition of 'ideation' perfectly: explicit suicidal expression without a plan or concrete tendency to act out.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""nearly killing myself one night."" It also mentions a future possibility: ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses feelings of dissociation (""don't feel like i'm in my body,"" ""watching someone work and live,"" ""disconnected from life""), numbness (""don't feel really anything for it""), hopelessness, and feeling out of control.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Specific methods are mentioned for a future potential action: ""step off a building or over a bridge."" There are no signs of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The phrase ""nearly killing myself one night"" is a direct reference to a past event that was very close to a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""nearly killing myself one night"" and ""step off a building or over a bridge.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly through the desire for control via suicide: ""Maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself."" The overall tone of detachment and wanting to escape the current state also implies a desire not to be alive in this way.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""step off a building or over a bridge.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). The phrase ""without thinking"" suggests impulsivity rather than detailed planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. ""nearly killing myself one night"" refers to a past event. ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" refers to a current vulnerability and future intention.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, ""nearly killing myself one night"" describes a past event that was either a very serious near-attempt or an interrupted attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It mentions specific methods for a potential future act (""step off a building or over a bridge""), indicating a tendency or plan. This would lean towards 'behavior'.
    *   Crucially, the post states ""nearly killing myself one night."" This is a very strong indicator of a ""historical experience of suicide attempt."" The phrasing ""nearly killing myself"" implies lethal intent and that the action progressed to a very dangerous point, making it more than just self-harm behavior and aligning it with a past suicide attempt.
    *   According to the definitions, the 'attempt' category includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The phrase ""nearly killing myself"" fits this criterion directly. Since the 'attempt' category represents the highest risk level among the options and the post clearly describes an event that was a very serious near-suicide attempt, it should be classified as 'attempt'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""shits not worth it anymore"", ""i need a way out"", ""i want to take myself out"", ""i just need it to stop."" These are strong expressions of wanting to end life.
   - Emotional indicators: ""i need help"", ""don't want to deal with it"", ""disappoint and burden other people"", ""scared it'll be painful"", ""can't go to anyone"". Indicates hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, fear, isolation.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method or plan is mentioned. The user asks ""what do i do, please?"", indicating a lack of a concrete plan and a search for one.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""i want to take myself out"" is a direct euphemism for suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""shits not worth it anymore"", ""i need a way out"", ""i just need it to stop.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The user is asking for guidance on ""what to do,"" which implies they have not yet identified or prepared a method.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and future intentions (""i want to take myself out"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""i want to take myself out"", ""i need a way out"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or immediate tendency to act. The user is asking for a ""way out"" and ""what to do,"" indicating a desire but not a formulated plan. The fear of pain also suggests a barrier to immediate action without a clear method.
   - Therefore, it fits the 'ideation' category, as there is explicit suicidal expression but no concrete plan or immediate tendency to commit suicide. It does not qualify as 'behavior' because there's no plan or tendency to act out, nor any historical self-harm mentioned. It's not 'attempt' as no attempt is described. It's not 'indicator' due to the explicit suicidal expression.

All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Ending it soon"", ""ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail"", ""I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here"". This specifies a method (dextromethorphan) and active preparation (ordered, waiting for arrival, intent to consume the entire amount).

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly and strongly. Phrases like ""how people can want to live?"" and the dread of ""60 fucking years left"" are clear expressions of not wanting to be alive or seeing value in continued existence.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""passive suicidal"", ""teetering on the edge of being suicidal"", ""suicide by cop"", ""suicide"". These terms refer to the state or potential actions of *someone else* being discussed, not the poster.
    *   Emotional indicators: The post expresses concern and frustration about counterproductive actions towards suicidal individuals. It does not indicate the poster's own emotional state of hopelessness or despair related to suicide.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""suicide by cop"" is mentioned as a potential method, but it is attributed to the hypothetical ""someone who's passive suicidal,"" not the poster.
    *   References to past attempts: None for the poster.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, multiple times.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the perspective of the person writing the post. The post discusses the suicidal state of *others*.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""suicide by cop.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The method is mentioned as a hypothetical outcome for ""someone else.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a general, cautionary scenario regarding how to interact with *other* potentially suicidal individuals. It does not describe the poster's past events or current/future intentions.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly discusses suicide and suicidal tendencies, but it does so in a general, cautionary, or observational context regarding *other people*.
    *   The crucial rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
    *   From the perspective of the person writing the post, there is no explicit expression of *their own* suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt. The content is a commentary on a dangerous situation involving others.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post uses euphemisms like ""the way I choose to go"" and ""how to do it"" in the context of using insulin, clearly implying suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life"", ""hate being a burden.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""had a plan in mind ever since"" (since the potential diabetes diagnosis).
        *   Mentions ""insulin pens"" as a means.
        *   Identifies a preferred method: ""a pump if my condition goes south quick and, with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go."" This is a very specific method and quantity.
        *   ""Had a couple ideas for how to do it"" confirms multiple plans.
        *   ""getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible"" indicates active consideration and preference for a specific, accessible method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens"" suggests a past dangerous incident involving insulin misuse, which could be interpreted as self-harm behavior. ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up"" refers to past ideation and planning, but not necessarily an attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but the phrases ""the way I choose to go"" and ""how to do it"" in the context of misusing insulin are direct expressions of suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" clearly expresses a desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""insulin pens"" and specifically ""a pump... with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The person has access to insulin pens and is considering acquiring a pump, explicitly for the purpose of ending their life.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Refers to past ideation/planning (""had a plan in mind ever since,"" ""Thought about doing it a couple times"").
    *   Refers to a past dangerous incident (""almost went into shock a while back"").
    *   Refers to current and future intentions and plans (""think that might be the way I choose to go,"" ""getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by detailing specific plans, methods (insulin pens, pump, specific dosage), and a clear intention to act (""think that might be the way I choose to go"").
    *   It mentions a historical experience (""almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens"") which, in the context of explicit suicidal planning, can be interpreted as a past instance of self-harm behavior or serious misuse of means.
    *   The criteria for 'behavior' include ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" This post fits perfectly due to the explicit suicidal expression, concrete plans, strong tendency to act, and the mention of a past dangerous incident involving the means.
    *   It does not explicitly state a *recent* or *historical suicide attempt*, which would be required for the 'attempt' category. The ""almost went into shock"" is more indicative of self-harm behavior than a full-fledged, explicit attempt.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself""
   - Emotional indicators: ""☹️"", ""tired of everything"", ""Worst birthday ever"", ""like I was nothing"" (indicating sadness, despair, hopelessness, feeling worthless).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I have a chance right now"" (implies opportunity/means, but no specific method is detailed).
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill yourself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday? well I do"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? ""I have a chance right now"" suggests an immediate opportunity or means is present, indicating a current capability or inclination to act, which goes beyond mere thought.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention/desire and perceived opportunity: ""well I do [want to kill myself] and I have a chance right now.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill yourself"", ""I do"").
   - The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" indicates more than just ideation. It suggests a current opportunity, means, or readiness to act, which aligns with a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" While a detailed plan isn't present, the ""chance right now"" implies a proximity to action. This distinguishes it from 'ideation', which explicitly states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" It does not describe a past or recent attempt. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been.

CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post explicitly states ""I just attempted to end my life"" and describes the physical consequences of this attempt (""My wrists and thighs are bleeding already""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'attempt' which includes ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to,"" ""I feel like killing myself,"" and ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't."" It also mentions ""I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live"" and ""I guess I'm dying alone too,"" and ""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys significant emotional distress, feelings of being hurt by family, isolation (""haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019,"" ""all I have is my family here""), hopelessness (""I'm at a dead end,"" ""no point to it""), and a sense of worthlessness (""wanted people to see my worth""). The author mentions crying and feeling like they need to go back on medicine.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The author explicitly states a *lack* of ""guts"" to act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The author explicitly states, ""I've never actually attempted suicide,"" referring to themselves.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The words ""suicide"" and ""killing myself"" are used.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""despite wanting to"" (attempt suicide), ""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would,"" and ""no other reason to live.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The post indicates a *lack* of intent or ability to act (""but I don't"" after ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The suicidal expressions are current feelings and desires (""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts... I would""). The author explicitly states they have *never* attempted suicide.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't,"" ""despite wanting to"" attempt suicide). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide,"" ruling out the 'attempt' category for the person writing the post.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method. Crucially, the author states ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't,"" which indicates a barrier to action and a *lack* of tendency to act out. The definition of 'behavior' requires ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" Neither of these conditions are met for the author.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'ideation' category, which is defined as: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

My fat ass of a guidance councillor was too busy eating chips to check her email and pull me out of the college level class early on. What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail? I got a fifty last term and the only way to pass is to get a 80 this term. That's impossible. Plus I only have a week left.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""ending my life tonight"", ""I'll find a way"", ""written my suicide note and put it on my notes app"", ""delete everything"", ""slit my wrists with some scissors when everyone is going to bed"".
   - References to past attempts: None explicitly mentioned for the person writing the post. ""If anyone saw my last post it's a continuation"" indicates ongoing distress but not a past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. ""ending my life tonight"", ""Killing myself is the only escape"", ""slit my wrists"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I'm ending my life tonight"", ""Killing myself is the only escape"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. ""slit my wrists with some scissors"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes. ""written my suicide note and put it on my notes app"", ""delete everything"". The phrase ""tonight"" indicates a specific timeframe for action.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and immediate future intentions. ""ending my life tonight"", ""I'm gonna just delete everything and just slit my wrists"".
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""ending my life tonight"", ""Killing myself is the only escape""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post clearly outlines a specific plan (""slit my wrists with some scissors"") and details preparations (""written my suicide note"", ""delete everything"") with an immediate timeframe (""tonight""). This indicates a strong ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"", which goes beyond mere 'ideation' (which states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide"").
   - There is no mention of a *past* suicide attempt, only current intent and preparation for an imminent act. Therefore, 'attempt' is not the correct category.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal expression, a specific method, and clear preparation for an imminent act aligns perfectly with the definition of 'behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""my plan to kill myself""
    *   Emotional indicators: Frustration, anger (""what the fuck""), feeling trapped/controlled (""preventing someone to get euthanized"", ""keeping their heads up and watching me"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself,"" indicating the existence of a plan, even if the details are not provided. The family's intervention (""watching me"") is a direct response to this revealed plan.
    *   References to past attempts: No direct mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""my plan to kill myself"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""my plan to kill myself"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is detailed in the post.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""my plan to kill myself"" implies a level of thought and potential preparation beyond mere ideation. The family's reaction (""snitched... told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me"") strongly suggests the plan was perceived as serious and actionable.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a current situation (""now they're keeping their heads up and watching me"") resulting from a recently revealed ""plan to kill myself"". This indicates a current or very recent intention that led to intervention.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   'indicator': Ruled out, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   'ideation': Ruled out. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post states ""my plan to kill myself,"" which goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts/desires) and implies a concrete plan or tendency to act, even if the action hasn't occurred or was prevented. The definition of ideation states ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
    *   'behavior': This category fits. The post has ""explicit suicidal expression"" (""my plan to kill myself"") and clearly indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through the explicit mention of ""my plan"" and the subsequent family intervention.
    *   'attempt': Ruled out, as there is no mention of a completed or failed suicide attempt, only a plan that was revealed and prevented.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""I hope my baby ends up safe"" (concern for a loved one, underlying despair)
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A clear timeline (""3 weeks from now"") and a behavioral plan of withdrawal (""Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children""). This indicates a clear intention and preparation.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, a specific timeline (""3 weeks from now"") and a clear behavioral preparation (withdrawal from others for 3 weeks). This indicates a tendency to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now."").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""im gonna kill myself""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It goes beyond mere 'ideation' because it includes a specific timeline (""3 weeks from now"") and a clear preparatory behavior (withdrawal from interaction for 3 weeks). This constitutes a plan or a clear tendency to act out suicide.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
    *   Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category as it signifies explicit suicidal expression with a plan/tendency to act.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the analysis, the post expresses profound hopelessness, worthlessness, and feelings of being a burden, which are significant risk factors for suicide. However, it lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, or any plans/methods. It does not mention resolved suicidal issues. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'indicator' as it shows significant distress and potential risk without explicit suicidal expression.

These indicate deep despair, hopelessness, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I wrote a note today."" This is a significant preparatory action often associated with suicide. No specific method is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions, ""I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours."" This describes a past crisis leading to hospitalization/intervention, but it is not explicitly stated as a ""suicide attempt."" It indicates a history of severe mental health crises requiring emergency care.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""I wrote a note today."" Writing a note is a common preparatory step for suicide.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   The post refers to both past struggles (""struggling my whole life,"" ""reached out for help last night,"" ""ER all night,"" ""in patient treatment... outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years"") and current/future intentions (""I wrote a note today,"" ""Lately It seems like that light has disappeared,"" ""I'm at the end of my rope,"" ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this,"" ""I think this is my last chance""). The ""note"" is a *current* action.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No, the hospitalization is described as a crisis and intervention, not explicitly a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Not applicable, as there is clear explicit suicidal expression (indirectly) and signs of preparation.
    *   **ideation:** Not applicable. While there is explicit suicidal expression, the presence of a preparatory action (""I wrote a note today"") moves it beyond mere ideation.
    *   **behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal expression (indirectly, through phrases like ""can't keep going,"" ""fear of non existence doesn't deter""). Crucially, it includes a clear sign of preparation or ""tendency to act out... suicide"" by stating, ""I wrote a note today."" This is a concrete action taken towards potential self-harm or suicide. The past hospitalization also indicates a history of severe crisis, aligning with the ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" aspect, although the ""note"" is the stronger current indicator of behavior.
    *   **attempt:** Not applicable. The post does not describe a recent or historical suicide *attempt*. The hospitalization was an intervention during a crisis, not explicitly an attempt described by the user.

    The phrase ""I wrote a note today"" is the key element that elevates this from 'ideation' to 'behavior', as it signifies a concrete step or preparation towards ending one's life.

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""end my life"" is a clear reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The repetition ""Tried didn't work. Tried... Didn't work."" indicates ongoing distress and a failed attempt.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Not explicitly mentioned, but the action ""Tried"" implies a method was used.
   - References to past attempts: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" explicitly states a past action to end life that was unsuccessful. The word ""again"" confirms it's a repeated historical event.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""end my life"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Tried to end my life again"" implies a desire to die by action.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to past events: ""Tried didn't work. Tried... again. Didn't work.""
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, the post describes a historical experience of trying to end one's life, which is a suicide attempt.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Incorrect, as there is explicit suicidal expression and mention of past actions.
   - 'ideation': Incorrect, as the post describes actions taken, not just thoughts or expressions without a plan/tendency to act.
   - 'behavior': This category includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While ""end my life"" is self-harm, it's more specifically a suicide attempt.
   - 'attempt': This category includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The phrase ""Tried to end my life again. Didn't work."" directly describes a historical, unsuccessful suicide attempt. This fits the definition most precisely.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: None. The post details a chronic medical condition (post-concussion syndrome) and the user's extensive efforts to find relief.
   - Note emotional indicators (hopelessness, despair, etc.): The user states, ""Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much."" This indicates significant frustration, despair, and hopelessness, but specifically in the context of their unresolved medical symptoms and lack of effective treatment.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The hopelessness is tied to their physical symptoms and the failure of treatments, not a desire to end their life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a past injury (7 months ago) and the ongoing, current struggle with symptoms and treatments. The feeling of hopelessness is current, related to their ongoing medical situation.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post expresses profound frustration and hopelessness, but this is entirely focused on the user's chronic health issues and the perceived failure of medical interventions.
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or a desire to die.
   - The emotional distress, while significant, does not cross the threshold into suicidal ideation or behavior as defined by the categories.
   - Therefore, it aligns with the 'indicator' category, which covers posts with no explicit suicidal expression.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme self-loathing, hopelessness, despair, feeling like a burden, lack of desire to get better.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post explicitly states: ""I have no plans"". While methods are mentioned (""bullet in my head"", ""stomp me out"", ""slit my fucking throat""), they are framed as something the user *deserves* or *wishes someone else would do to them*, not as a plan they intend to execute themselves. There are no signs of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, through phrases like ""I deserve to die"", ""deserve a fucking bullet in my head"", ""slit my fucking throat"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I deserve to die"", ""I just deserve to be dead"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""bullet in my head"", ""stomp me out"", ""slit my fucking throat"".
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.
    *   Crucially, the post explicitly states, ""I have no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway"". The methods mentioned are desires for external action, not internal plans for self-harm.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and desires. No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I deserve to die"", ""deserve a fucking bullet in my head""), which rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post explicitly states ""I have no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway"". While specific methods of death are mentioned, they are presented as desires for external action or things the user *deserves*, not as a plan or tendency for the user to act out self-harm or suicide themselves. This lack of a self-initiated plan or tendency to act out differentiates it from 'behavior'.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post has explicit suicidal expression but clearly states there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide by the person writing the post. This fits the definition of 'ideation'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I will die alone."", ""I'm only alive by obligation."", ""My parents don't deserve to bury their child."", ""But the second they're gone, so am I."" (strong implication of suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, despair, self-loathing (""hideous fucking mutant"", ""fat retard""), profound sadness (""just a fucking sad man""), emptiness (""sick of this emptiness"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None explicitly mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? The word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""the second they're gone, so am I"" is a very strong and direct expression of a conditional intention to end their life. ""I'm only alive by obligation"" implies a desire not to be alive.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""the second they're gone, so am I"" and ""I'm only alive by obligation.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current feelings (""I'm only alive by obligation"", ""I'm just a fucking sad man"", ""sick of this emptiness"") and a clear future intention/condition for suicide (""But the second they're gone, so am I."").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression.
   - 'ideation': This category requires explicit suicidal expression *but no plan or tendency to commit suicide*. While there's no immediate, detailed plan, the statement ""But the second they're gone, so am I"" expresses a clear *tendency* or *intention* to act, albeit conditional on a future event. This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) and into a stated intent to act.
   - 'behavior': This category requires explicit suicidal expression *and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide*. The statement ""But the second they're gone, so am I"" represents a conditional plan/tendency to act out suicide. It's a declared intention for a future action, making it more than just ideation.
   - 'attempt': Not applicable, as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the analysis, the conditional statement of intent (""the second they're gone, so am I"") signifies a ""tendency to act out suicide,"" even if contingent on a future event. This aligns best with the 'behavior' category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal ones"", ""self destructive ones"", ""killing myself"", ""suicide"" (referencing a tumblr post and its aftermath).
   - Emotional indicators: ""bad urges"", ""guilty downward spiral"", ""hate myself for thinking of killing myself"", ""don't know what I want anymore"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Explicitly states ""I have a plan but no date set kind of bad"". This is a direct mention of a plan.
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past *suicide attempts*. Mentions ""bad urges tonight. not even just suicidal ones, self destructive ones in general as well. they've been happening again for a while now"" which suggests ongoing self-destructive urges/behaviors.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal ones"", ""killing myself"", ""suicide"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly through the ""bad urges"" and the mention of having a plan.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is detailed.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the post explicitly states ""I have a plan but no date set"". This indicates a concrete plan, even if the details are withheld.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current urges and future intentions (""I have a plan but no date set""). ""they've been happening again for a while now"" refers to ongoing urges.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal ones"", ""killing myself"").
   - Crucially, it states ""I have a plan but no date set"". This directly indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" as per the 'behavior' category definition.
   - It does not describe a recent or historical suicide *attempt*.
   - It is more than 'ideation' because a plan is present.
   - It is not 'indicator' as there is explicit, unresolved suicidal expression.
   Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff"", ""starts to happen more and more frequently"", ""grave I dug myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""less likely to talk about"", ""massive issue"", ""lot of stress"", ""tough enough"", ""not sure if I'm strong enough"". These indicate distress, struggle, and a feeling of being overwhelmed.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The phrase ""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself"" is a strong metaphorical expression of feeling trapped and overwhelmed by a life-threatening situation, implying a struggle with the desire to escape or end the current state, which is linked to the escalating ""suicidal thoughts.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current and escalating experiences (""starts to happen more and more frequently"", ""not sure if I'm strong enough"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and indicates they are becoming ""more and more frequently,"" suggesting a current and worsening state of suicidal ideation.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or intent to act on these thoughts. The ""grave"" metaphor describes a state of being overwhelmed, not an action or plan.
   - There is no mention of past or recent self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation' as it contains explicit suicidal expression without a plan or clear tendency to commit suicide.

""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"" and ""I fucking hate living"" refer to *current* feelings and explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** ""nearly killing myself"" strongly suggests a past severe suicidal crisis or a failed/interrupted suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I fucking hate living"").
    *   Crucially, it mentions a historical experience: ""nearly killing myself"". This phrase implies being on the very edge of committing suicide, which aligns with ""historical experience of suicide attempt"" even if the act was not completed, it was attempted or very nearly so.
    *   Comparing 'behavior' and 'attempt':
        *   'behavior': ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
        *   'attempt': ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
    *   ""Nearly killing myself"" is a more severe indication than general ""self-harm behaviour"" and points directly to the intent and proximity of a suicide attempt. Therefore, it fits the 'attempt' category better due to the historical context of being on the verge of suicide.

    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The statement ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" expresses the *idea* of suicide as a solution, but not a concrete ""plan or tendency to act out.""
    *   There is no mention of a recent suicide attempt or historical experience of a suicide attempt, which rules out 'attempt'.
    *   There is no mention of historical self-harm *behavior*, only historical *feelings* and *thoughts*. The post describes a general feeling and a thought about suicide as a solution, not a specific ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
    *   Therefore, the post fits the 'ideation' category: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

408,"About depression. It makes it hard to keep going. Every day feels like the previous one, hearing the voice in death stranding ""*keep on keeping on. *"" over and over. It's even harder for friends or close people to understand how badly mangled (psychically) you are. Feels like only depressed people can understand each other, as a closed circle. It slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away. I wonder if a long-term cure even exists.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: No direct mentions of suicide or self-harm. The phrase ""death stranding"" refers to a video game, not a literal wish for death.
   - Emotional indicators: ""hard to keep going"", ""Every day feels like the previous one"", ""badly mangled (psychically)"", ""slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away"", ""I wonder if a long-term cure even exists."" These indicate profound depression, hopelessness, a feeling of being trapped, and a struggle for endurance.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The phrase ""hard to keep going"" expresses difficulty enduring life with depression, not a direct wish for death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and ongoing struggle with depression.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   Based on the analysis, the post describes severe and chronic depression, leading to feelings of hopelessness and difficulty coping (""hard to keep going""). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, self-harm, or any plans/methods. It expresses the profound suffering of depression but does not cross the threshold into explicit suicidal ideation or behavior. Therefore, it fits the 'indicator' category, as it describes a state of mind without explicit suicidal expression.

I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post contains numerous direct mentions of suicide and self-harm, primarily through quotes from the user's parents. Examples include: ""kill yourself,"" ""disappeared,"" ""shoot yourself,"" ""try to kill yourself again,"" and ""cut your wrists again.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys extreme emotional abuse, neglect, and mockery from the parents towards the user, indicating a highly distressing and damaging environment. While the user's *own* direct emotional expression is limited to one question, the content strongly implies deep pain and suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The parents suggest methods (""gun,"" ""shoot,"" ""cut wrists""), but the *user* (the person writing the post) does not express any personal plan, method, or preparation for suicide or self-harm in the present.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The parents' quotes explicitly refer to the user's *past* suicide attempts and self-harm behaviors: ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"", and ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"".

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, repeatedly, primarily by the parents in their quoted statements to the user.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No, not from the *person writing the post* themselves. The post is a recounting of parental abuse.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, by the parents (""gun,"" ""shoot,"" ""cut wrists"").
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No, not from the user.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   This post primarily describes ongoing and past verbal abuse. The references to suicide and self-harm (""again"") clearly indicate *past* behaviors or attempts by the user, as mocked or perceived by the parents. There is no indication of *current* or *future* suicidal intent from the user themselves.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post does not express current suicidal ideation or plans from the user. However, it explicitly *mentions historical experience of suicide attempt* (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to try to kill yourself again?"") and *historical experience of self-harm behaviour* (""Are you going to cut your wrists again?"").
    *   The 'behavior' category includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
    *   The 'attempt' category includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
    *   Since the post contains explicit references to *past suicide attempts* by the user, which is a more severe classification than general self-harm behavior, the 'attempt' category is the most appropriate fit. The rule states that the risk corresponds to the person writing the post, and the parents' quotes provide direct evidence of the user's past attempts.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""kill yourself"", ""Kim's"" (likely a typo for 'kill myself').
   - Emotional indicators: Desperation, urgency (""I just need a way"", ""someone just give me a straight up answer""), rejection of intervention (""I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is actively asking for ""the least painful way to kill yourself"", which is a direct inquiry about methods. This indicates a search for a plan.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill yourself"", ""Kim's"" / kill myself).
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, by asking for ways to ""kill yourself"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, but the user is explicitly *asking for* specific methods (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""). This indicates a strong intent to find and potentially use a method.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The active search for a method is a significant step towards preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I just need a way to Kim's"", ""someone just give me a straight up answer"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill yourself"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by actively seeking information on methods (""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?""). This active search for a method signifies a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" by seeking means to do so. It's not just a thought, but an inquiry into execution.
   - It does not mention a recent or historical suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, it best fits the 'behavior' category, which includes explicit suicidal expression and a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""suicidal note""
   - Emotional indicators: ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside"" indicates severe distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again."" Writing a suicidal note is a preparatory act often preceding suicide.
   - References to past attempts: The word ""again"" suggests past instances of writing suicidal notes, which is a form of preparatory behavior.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicidal note"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not directly, but the intention to write a suicidal note strongly implies this.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? The act of ""writing a suicidal note"" is a specific preparatory step.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the intention to ""write a suicidal note"" is a sign of preparation.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a future intention (""I think I'm going to write..."") and past behavior (""again"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Not an attempt, but past *behavior* (writing notes) is implied.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression and a clear intention to act.
   - 'ideation': Not applicable, as there is not just ideation but also a stated intention to engage in a preparatory act (""write a suicidal note"") and a reference to past similar behaviors.
   - 'behavior': This category fits. The post has explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal note""). There is a ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" (writing a suicidal note is a preparatory step indicating a tendency to act). It also mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""again"" implying past note-writing).
   - 'attempt': Not applicable, as the post describes an intention to write a note, not a recent or historical suicide attempt itself.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""slaying myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide or self-harm. ""committing a massacre"" refers to violence but is not self-directed in its primary meaning, though it sets a dark tone.
   - Emotional indicators: The language suggests distress, violent thoughts, or a sense of hopelessness leading to such thoughts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""slaying myself"" implies a method (violent self-harm), but no specific tool, location, or detailed preparations are mentioned. It's a general statement of intent.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""slaying myself"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""slaying myself"" expresses a desire to end one's life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? A general method (""slaying myself"") is mentioned, but no specific tools (e.g., ""with a knife,"" ""by jumping""), locations, or detailed steps are provided.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I will end up..."" and ""or maybe just slaying myself"" refer to future possibilities or intentions.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""slaying myself""), which immediately rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on the presence of a *plan* or a *tendency to act out*. While ""slaying myself"" is a form of self-harm, the statement ""or maybe just slaying myself"" presents it as an alternative thought or contemplation, rather than a concrete, specific plan with details (like *how* or *when*) or a strong, immediate tendency to act. It lacks the specificity and immediacy typically associated with 'behavior' (e.g., ""I'm going to jump tonight"" or ""I have the pills ready""). Therefore, it falls under explicit suicidal expression without a concrete plan or clear tendency to commit suicide.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states, ""my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody."" It also explicitly states, ""I don't want to die— I want to live"".
   - Emotional indicators: Loneliness (""I wish I had friends""), frustration/laziness (""Why can't I do anything?"", ""I'm lazy as hell""), feelings of inadequacy/shame (""I feel so stupid"", ""I feel constantly out classed by my peers"", ""shame I have of not being anybody""), overwhelm (""everything is overwhelming"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The post focuses on internal struggles and a desire for change, not on any action related to self-harm or suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""my suicidal ideation"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post explicitly states, ""I don't want to die— I want to live"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and struggles, and a desire to overcome them and live. The ""suicidal ideation"" is presented as a current internal state, but one the user is actively resisting and trying to understand its root cause, rather than a desire to act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation,"" which is a direct form of explicit suicidal expression.
   - Crucially, the post states ""I don't want to die— I want to live,"" indicating there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.
   - There are no mentions of past self-harm or suicide attempts, nor any current plans or preparations.
   - Based on the definitions:
     - 'indicator' is for no explicit suicidal expression or resolved issues. While there's a desire to live, the ""suicidal ideation"" is explicitly stated as present, not necessarily resolved.
     - 'ideation' is for explicit suicidal expression but no plan or tendency. This perfectly matches ""my suicidal ideation"" combined with ""I don't want to die— I want to live.""
     - 'behavior' requires a plan or tendency to act, or historical self-harm, none of which are present.
     - 'attempt' requires a recent or historical attempt, none of which are present.
   - Therefore, 'ideation' is the most fitting category.

I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""shoot myself in the head"", ""don't die"", ""suicide hotline"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hesitation, fear of disability (""permanently disabled"", ""crippled""), distrust of help (""not calling a suicide hotline"", ""shitty experiences"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"" is a specific method and a stated desire to acquire the means.
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""shoot myself in the head"", ""suicide hotline"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the initial statement ""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"" expresses a desire to end life.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""dad's handgun"" and ""shoot myself in the head"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The statement ""I wanna get my dad's handgun"" indicates a desire to acquire the means, which is a clear step towards a plan, even if followed by hesitation about the outcome.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I wanna get..."", ""shoot myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""shoot myself in the head"").
   - It also describes a specific plan/method (""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head"") and a stated intention to acquire the means, which indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
   - While there is hesitation, it's about the *outcome* (disability) rather than the existence of the plan or the desire to carry it out. The presence of a specific method and the stated desire to acquire means pushes it beyond mere ideation.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category as it involves explicit suicidal expression with a plan and tendency to act.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal expression (""my life isn't worth living anymore"", ""I can't see myself having a life worth living"") but lacks any mention of a plan, method, or tendency to act on these feelings. It also does not mention any past self-harm or suicide attempts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation'.

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

   - The post expresses a clear intention and sets a timeline (""soon"", ""by February""), indicating a ""tendency to act out suicide"" and a ""plan"" regarding timing, even without a specific method. This goes beyond mere 'ideation' which implies no plan or tendency to commit.
   - The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". The post fits this description due to the explicit intention and the established timeline.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not appropriate.

        *   Future: The ""final test"" and the condition ""cannot live if i fail"" refer to a future contingency. ""how I'll do it"" refers to a future action if the condition is met.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** Past self-harm (""blades i used to cut"") is described, but it's not explicitly stated as a suicide *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, albeit conditional (""cannot live if i fail"").
    *   It explicitly mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""blades i used to cut"").
    *   The definition for 'behavior' states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, *or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour*.""
    *   Even though the current sentiment is more positive and there is no *current* plan, the presence of historical self-harm behavior, combined with the conditional suicidal ideation, fits the 'behavior' category. The ""or"" clause in the definition is crucial here.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

    *   **References to past attempts:** No. The post explicitly states, ""But I don't do it. I don't deserve to."" This indicates a current decision *not* to act, despite having plans. The mentions of ""past events"" refer to the duration of suicidal thoughts and attempts at coping mechanisms, not past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die because I hate myself"").

The detailed planning (""contemplated and devised"") is described as an ongoing ""hobby."" The current state is ""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans."" While the *action* is currently being withheld due to a personal philosophy (""I don't do it. I don't deserve to. I must remain and suffer.""), the plans themselves are current and well-developed. No past attempts are mentioned.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   The post goes far beyond mere ideation by detailing specific methods, calculations, and preparations (""calculated how much,"" ""tested the strength,"" ""figured out how to ensure""). The user explicitly states, ""I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself."" This presence of detailed plans aligns with the 'behavior' category, which states ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan *or* tendency to act out self-harm or suicide."" Even though the user states they are currently *not* acting on the plans due to a personal belief, the existence and detail of the plans themselves are sufficient to meet the ""plan"" criterion for 'behavior'.

The phrase ""i know i might end up in hell / that whatever comes after this might be worse"" also implies a belief in an afterlife, consistent with contemplating death by suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living""), despair, internal conflict regarding farewells (""not sure if that would like, haunt people more or something"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates a timeline for an intended act. The contemplation of ""calling my grandparents,"" ""telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother"" are strong indicators of farewell gestures, which are a form of preparation for an imminent suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned. ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"" indicates long-standing ideation, not a past attempt.

    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes. ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates a chosen, imminent timeline. The internal debate about making farewell calls/gestures (""calling people?"", ""telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother"") strongly suggests preparation for an imminent act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Primarily current/future intentions. ""the day i chose is very soon"" refers to an imminent future event. The contemplation of calls/hugs is for the present/immediate future. ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to a long-standing desire (past ideation), but the *intent to act* is framed as current and imminent.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""shouldn't kill myself"", ""wanted to do this for over a decade"", ""not cut out for life"").
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation because there is a clear indication of a plan and tendency to act out. ""the day i chose is very soon"" implies a concrete timeline. The contemplation of farewell gestures (calling loved ones, hugging brother) indicates preparation for an imminent act, which falls under ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific methods (e.g., tool, location, substance) are mentioned. No signs of preparation for suicide are mentioned. ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" indicates social withdrawal, which is a risk factor, but not a direct plan or preparation for suicide itself.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of past suicide attempts. It mentions ""most suicidal I've been In a couple months,"" which refers to the intensity of past suicidal *feelings* or *ideation*, not past *attempts*.

    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to current feelings and future intentions of withdrawal (""feel like abandoning everyone"", ""I Just want to be out of my misery"", ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while""). It also references the intensity of past suicidal *feelings* (""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""most suicidal I've been"", ""want to be out of my misery""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan (e.g., how, when, where, with what means) or a clear tendency to act out self-harm or suicide. The withdrawal mentioned is a concerning sign but not a direct plan or action.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, nor any historical self-harm *behavior*. It only mentions the intensity of past suicidal *ideation*.

   - Emotional indicators: Extreme anger, hostility, desire for retribution.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None related to the poster's own harm.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not by the poster regarding themselves.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the poster is expressing a wish for someone else to die.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for the poster's own harm.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (account banned) and a current/future wish for *another person*.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The key rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".
   - The post contains no suicidal expression or indication of self-harm intent from the person writing the post. It is a hostile expression directed at someone else.
   - Therefore, it does not fit 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt'. It falls into 'indicator' as it shows no self-harm risk from the poster.

437,"I will kill my bullie. Hello guys, for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill  only yourself, but others. I have a problem, this women is bullying me and other people with her for couple of years now. I will kill her. I tried every possible thing to make her stop, but she is the most jealous person I have ever met in my life, so I will kill her, to finally live my life in peace. Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post repeatedly mentions ""kill my bullie"", ""kill her"", and ""murder her"". It also references ""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others,"" which is a discussion of murder-suicide, but the explicit intent described by the poster is to kill another person, not themselves.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Frustration, desperation, desire for peace (""I tried every possible thing to make her stop"", ""finally live my life in peace"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user asks for ""suggestion of how to murder her,"" indicating a search for methods and a clear intention to plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past suicide attempts or self-harm attempts are mentioned. ""Tried every possible thing to make her stop"" refers to attempts to stop bullying, not self-harm.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used in a general discussion about a type of suicide that involves killing others. However, the *poster's own intent* is explicitly stated as killing the bully, not themselves.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The poster expresses a desire to kill someone else to achieve peace for themselves (""to finally live my life in peace""). There is no expression of wanting to die or not be alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method is mentioned, but the post explicitly asks for ""suggestion of how to murder her,"" which indicates active planning and seeking of methods for homicide.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Seeking suggestions for how to commit murder is a form of preparation/planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""I will kill her"" indicates a clear future intention. ""I tried every possible thing"" refers to past actions to resolve the bullying.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No past *suicide* or *self-harm* attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The core of the post is about the poster's intent to commit homicide against another person, not suicide or self-harm against themselves.
    *   The rule states: ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned"".
    *   While the word ""suicide"" appears, it's in the context of a general concept (murder-suicide) and not an expression of the poster's own suicidal intent. The poster's explicit desire is to kill the bully, not to end their own life.
    *   Since there is no explicit suicidal expression *from the poster about themselves*, despite the concerning homicidal content, it does not fit 'ideation', 'behavior', or 'attempt' as these categories require explicit suicidal expression *of the poster*. Therefore, it falls under 'indicator' because it has ""no explicit suicidal expression"" by the poster regarding their own life.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""on the verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end it all"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""cannot do this anymore"", ""mental health really bad"", ""stress"", ""disappointment and failure"". These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I know exactly what to do."" This strongly implies a specific plan or method is formed in the user's mind, even if not detailed in the post.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""on the verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No explicit method (tools, locations, substances) is described.
   - Are there signs of preparation? The phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" is a strong indicator of a formed plan or method, moving beyond general thoughts to a concrete intention.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm on the verge"", ""I seriously cannot do this anymore"", ""I know exactly what to do"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""on the verge of suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end it all""), ruling out 'indicator'.
   - The statement ""I know exactly what to do"" indicates the presence of a plan or a clear tendency to act, even if the specifics of the plan are not detailed. This differentiates it from 'ideation' where there is ""no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
   - The definition of 'behavior' includes ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"". This aligns perfectly with the post's content.

   - Note emotional indicators: ""tired of being unhappy lost and alone"", ""tired of being depressed and always rejected"", ""unhappy life"", ""struggle with that again"", ""take all thoughts away from my mind"", ""everything negative out my life"". These indicate significant emotional distress, despair, and a desire for relief from suffering.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire for current struggles and negative feelings to cease (""take all thoughts away from my mind"", ""everything negative out my life"") and to be ""normal"", but not a direct wish for death or to not be alive.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to ongoing current distress and a plea for future change/relief (""am tired of..."", ""please help me"", ""do a miracle""). No past attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post conveys extreme emotional distress and a desire for relief from suffering. However, it *lacks any explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or any suicidal ideation*. The user is pleading for a change in their circumstances and internal state, not for an end to their life. According to the definitions, 'ideation' requires explicit suicidal expression, which is absent here. 'Behavior' and 'attempt' also require explicit suicidal expression or actions, which are not present. Therefore, the post falls under 'indicator' as it has no explicit suicidal expression.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The word ""suicidal"" is explicitly mentioned in the question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"".
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses significant frustration and hopelessness due to chronic, unresolved knee pain (""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts,"" ""no change in sight,"" ""It's been 8 months"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicidal"" is used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While it's phrased as a question (""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?""), it directly brings up the concept of being suicidal in relation to the poster's own suffering, implying they are experiencing or contemplating such feelings themselves. This constitutes explicit suicidal expression.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to an ongoing, current struggle with pain (""It's been 8 months, with no change in sight"") and a current state of mind or feeling (""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"").

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

- The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal"").
- There is no mention of a specific plan or method.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life"" and connects it to the poster's own comfort in potentially seeing them again, implying their own suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes. ""I don't think I can go on much longer"", ""I'm over life"", ""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"".

    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** Yes, ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" suggests a pre-suicidal task or a final condition before acting, indicating a *tendency to act out* or a form of preparation.

The reference to someone else's suicide is past, but its connection to the poster's feelings makes it relevant to their current suicidal ideation.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No past attempts by the *poster* are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm over life"", ""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" goes beyond mere ideation. It implies a condition or a final task before the act, indicating a *tendency to act out* or a preparatory step. While not a detailed plan, it suggests movement towards action.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide *attempt* by the poster, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The presence of explicit suicidal expression combined with a clear *tendency to act out* (implied by the ""one last record"" statement as a condition for the end) fits the definition of 'behavior'.

    *   Emotional indicators: ""make my mom feel pain"", ""Everything she says is just stupid"", ""She belittles me everytime she speaks"", ""feel pain and hurt"", ""worth it"". These indicate strong negative emotions like anger, resentment, and despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it"" refers to the *impact* of the death, not a method or preparation for it.

    *   **indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out as no recent or historical attempt is mentioned.
    *   **behavior:** This category requires explicit suicidal expression *and* a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour. While there is explicit expression, there is no specific plan mentioned (e.g., method, time, location) nor any clear ""tendency to act out"" beyond the expressed desire. The post focuses on the *desire* and the *motivation* for that desire, not on the steps towards enacting it.
    *   **ideation:** This category states ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" This fits perfectly. The user explicitly states ""I want to die,"" which is suicidal expression. However, there is no mention of a specific plan (how, when, where) or any indication of steps being taken or a clear tendency to act out immediately.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses a clear desire to die but lacks any specific plan or indication of immediate action, fitting the definition of ideation.

   - It also discusses other specific methods (""hanging myself"", ""access to a gun"") and a preference for one, indicating a clear plan and tendency to act out.
   - This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) and describes an active ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" through current actions and future intentions with specific methods and timelines. It does not describe a past or recent failed attempt, but rather an ongoing behavior and future intent. Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category.

But everytime I try I fail. Today I failed because my best and only friend wants to have dinner with me on sunday and I can't leave him alone down here. I was raped for 10 years by my father and grandfather and it was recorded. I was at the police but the didn't even inform the suspect, there was no trial. nothing.

Today was a Fwb visiting me and I felt so dirty and I didn't feel secure and he touched me but stoped when I didnt react. I didn't feel like talking so I kept everything to myseld.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states ""I've been suicidale all my life."" It mentions ""wanna go to the angels,"" ""tried to cut my wrists,"" ""laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over,"" ""jumped in front of a train,"" and ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" It also says ""I can't go on like this"" and ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Hopelessness (""I can't go on like this,"" ""my life is just full of rape, abuse and suffering""), despair, feeling ""dirty,"" ""not secure,"" ""nobody,"" ""God left me alone.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The phrase ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" describes a specific method (hanging) and an action taken towards it, even if not completed. ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"" indicates a current intention to act after a specific event.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post explicitly details multiple past actions: ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists,"" ""When I was 19 I laid on a road in the dark hoping a car would run me over,"" ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, directly (""suicidale"") and indirectly through descriptions of actions and intentions (""rope around my neck,"" ""do it,"" ""wanna go to the angels,"" ""can't go on like this"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""wanna go to the angels,"" ""I can't go on like this"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, hanging (""rope around my neck""), cutting wrists, lying on a road to be hit by a car, jumping in front of a train.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" describes an immediate, physical action taken towards a method. The current thought ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"" indicates a current plan to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both.
        *   **Past events:** The post describes several past actions that are clearly suicide attempts: ""When I was eleven I tried to cut my wrists,"" ""When I was 19 I laid on a road... hoping a car would run me over,"" ""When I was 24 I jumped in front of a train.""
        *   **Current/future intentions:** ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" refers to a very recent, uncompleted action. ""Today I failed because..."" indicates a recent attempt. ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"" expresses a current, albeit hesitant, intention.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It describes *multiple historical experiences of suicide attempts* (""tried to cut my wrists,"" ""laid on a road... hoping a car would run me over,"" ""jumped in front of a train""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'attempt'.
    *   It also describes a *recent action taken towards suicide* (""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck""), which, even if not completed, indicates a recent attempt or very strong behavioral manifestation of an attempt. The phrase ""Today I failed"" further confirms a recent attempt.
    *   Given the explicit mention of historical suicide attempts and a very recent, described action towards suicide, the 'attempt' category is the most fitting.

As of right now I don't have any plans to end it, but I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come. Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier. I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post directly asks ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"". It contains phrases like ""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come"", ""die at 50 or earlier"", and ""not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I feel like I'm at the point..."", ""future is really grim"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user states ""As of right now I don't have any plans to end it"". However, they mention a passive action: ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's"". This is a form of self-neglect.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, by directly asking ""Is it suicidal..."".
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come"", ""not worth pushing my life further"". This indicates a passive death wish or acceptance of death.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No active methods for *causing* death are mentioned. The user explicitly denies having ""any plans to end it"".
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** The action of ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" is a passive form of self-neglect or a cessation of life-preserving actions, which can be interpreted as a tendency towards self-harm.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to current feelings and behaviors (""I feel like I'm at the point..."", ""I have stopped visiting the doctor's"") and future acceptance (""willing to accept when my time has come"", ""if I die then I die"").
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains **explicit suicidal expression** (""if I die then I die"", ""willing to accept when my time has come""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The user states ""I don't have any plans to end it"", which might suggest 'ideation'. However, the 'behavior' category includes ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
    *   The action ""stopped visiting the doctor's"" is a concrete, albeit passive, behavior. Self-neglect, such as refusing medical care, can be considered a form of **self-harm**. This action, combined with the expressed passive acceptance of death, indicates a ""tendency to act out self-harm"" (by neglecting one's health). While not an active plan to *cause* suicide, it's a behavior that demonstrates a disregard for one's own well-being and aligns with the passive death wish. This moves it beyond mere ideation (thoughts without action/tendency to act).

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned. ""starve myself or something"" is mentioned as a potential extreme method for weight loss, which could be interpreted as self-harm, but is not explicitly framed as a suicide method.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hate myself,"" ""depressed,"" ""too much of a coward"" (indicating a desire to die but lack of courage to act), ""too ugly,"" ""too lazy,"" ""my thyroid is too fucked up"" (feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, self-loathing).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No concrete plan or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" explicitly states a *lack* of intent to act despite the suicidal thoughts. ""starve myself or something"" is presented as a hypothetical, extreme measure for weight loss, not a direct suicide plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** Yes, ""kill myself.""
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, the phrase ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" implies a desire to die or escape, but a stated inability/unwillingness to act on it.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** ""starve myself or something"" is mentioned, but in a context that does not indicate a current, actionable suicide plan. It's presented as an extreme, almost hypothetical, option for weight loss, and is immediately preceded by a statement of being ""too much of a coward to kill myself.""
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Refers to current feelings and a perceived inability to act on suicidal thoughts. ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" describes a current state of mind.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   However, the crucial phrase ""I'm too much of a coward to kill myself"" indicates that despite the suicidal thoughts, there is no current plan or tendency to commit suicide. The mention of ""starve myself or something"" is ambiguous and less indicative of a concrete plan than the explicit statement of being a ""coward"" to act.
    *   There is no mention of a concrete plan, preparation, or a clear tendency to act.
    *   There is no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   Therefore, the post expresses suicidal thoughts (ideation) but explicitly states a lack of intent or courage to act, fitting the 'ideation' category.

Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""thinking about suicide"" in the context of a ""friend who is struggling.""
   - Note emotional indicators: The post is informative and offers advice on how to help others. It does not convey personal distress, hopelessness, or despair from the author.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned by the author for themselves or for the friend. The post focuses on emotional support (hugs, support).
   - Check for references to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned for the author. A ""friend"" is mentioned as ""struggling and thinking about suicide,"" but this refers to someone else.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the word ""suicide"" is used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the author. The author is discussing how to help *others* who might be thinking about suicide.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to general advice for helping others who are currently struggling. It does not describe past events or current/future intentions of the *author* regarding suicide.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post discusses suicide, but it is entirely in the context of providing advice on how to help a friend who is struggling with suicidal thoughts.
   - According to the rules, ""The suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post, not other people potentially being mentioned.""
   - The author of the post is not expressing any personal suicidal thoughts, plans, behaviors, or past attempts. The mention of suicide is external to the author's own state.
   - Therefore, for the person writing the post, there is ""no explicit suicidal expression"" that indicates personal risk. The content is about understanding and resolving issues for others. This aligns with the 'indicator' category.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme hopelessness, despair, loneliness, self-blame, feeling trapped and isolated.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned. The mention of ""took my last Ativan today"" and ""doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me"" indicates a loss of a coping mechanism, leading to increased distress, but not a plan to use Ativan for suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts mentioned.
    *   **Other relevant details:** Stopped medication, drinking heavily (relapse), fear of commitment hindering open communication with professionals. These are risky behaviors contributing to the mental state but are not described as self-harm *actions* or part of a suicide *plan*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicide is their life's purpose"", ""killing myself"").

    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current feelings and future intentions (""no reason to live"", ""finally becoming content with that"", ""will only drive me further to killing myself""). The breakup is a past event, but the suicidal thoughts are current and intensifying.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""no reason to live"", ""suicide is their life's purpose"", ""killing myself""). This immediately rules out 'indicator'.
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or concrete steps being taken towards suicide. The user expresses a growing acceptance of suicide as a purpose and a strong desire to die, but without outlining *how* they would act on it.
    *   The 'behavior' category requires ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" While the user is engaging in risky behaviors (stopping meds, heavy drinking), these are described as coping mechanisms failing, leading to increased distress and ideation, rather than direct actions *of* self-harm or *as part of a suicide plan*. There is no historical experience of self-harm behavior mentioned. The desire to ""kill myself"" is expressed as a future outcome of their current state and fear of seeking help, not a present, actionable plan.
    *   The post fits 'ideation' because it has explicit suicidal expression and a strong inclination towards suicide, but it lacks the concrete plan or clear tendency to *act out* a specific method required for 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""not to kill myself"", ""postpone any suicide attempts"".
    *   Emotional indicators: Positive (excitement for Star Wars) but within a context of suicidal thoughts/tendencies. The positive emotion is presented as a *reason* to *not* act on underlying suicidal urges.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: ""postpone any suicide attempts"" strongly implies a history of considering or having a tendency towards suicide attempts, even if not explicitly stating a past event.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""suicide attempts"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the expression is the opposite – a reason *not* to die – but it explicitly acknowledges the presence of suicidal thoughts/tendencies that need to be postponed.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/future intentions (""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so""). The phrasing also implies a continuous or recurring consideration of suicide attempts.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
    *   ""indicator"": The post *does* have explicit suicidal expression, so it's not an indicator.
    *   ""ideation"": The post has explicit suicidal expression. However, the phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" indicates more than just ideation; it suggests an active *tendency* or a history of considering/planning attempts that are now being put off. This goes beyond mere thoughts.
    *   ""behavior"": The post has explicit suicidal expression (""kill myself"", ""suicide attempts""). The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" clearly indicates a *tendency to act out self-harm or suicide* (i.e., a tendency towards attempts) that is being temporarily suppressed. It doesn't explicitly state a past attempt, but the *tendency* is evident. This fits the definition of 'behavior'.
    *   ""attempt"": The post does not explicitly state a recent or historical suicide attempt, although it implies a history of considering them. It's about *postponing* future attempts, not describing a past one.

The key phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" signifies an ongoing struggle or a clear tendency towards suicidal actions, which is being temporarily halted. This aligns best with the 'behavior' category's description of ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post mentions ""smell of a Dead Body,"" but this is a perceived external event (""My landlord called for the smell of a Dead Body""), not related to the poster's own self-harm or suicidal intent. There are no direct mentions of suicide, self-harm, or wanting to die.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm so tired,"" ""My heads messing with me,"" ""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""it's hard to deal,"" ""I cant take this torture from these people,"" ""I want to leave,"" ""I have no money to just walk out,"" ""I dont know what options I have left,"" ""I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs."" These indicate extreme exhaustion, distress, paranoia, hopelessness, feeling trapped, and a desire to escape a difficult situation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None. The desire to ""leave this place"" refers to the physical location/situation, not life itself.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The expressions of being ""tired"" and wanting to ""leave"" refer to exhaustion and wanting to escape the current living situation, respectively, not a desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** The post describes current severe distress, paranoia, and a desire to escape the present difficult living situation.
    *   **Are past attempts specifically described?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly conveys severe distress, paranoia, a feeling of being trapped, and hopelessness regarding the current situation.
    *   However, it *lacks any explicit suicidal expression*. There is no mention of wanting to die, self-harm, or any suicidal plans or past attempts. The desire to ""leave"" is directed at the living situation, not life itself.
    *   Based on the definitions, the absence of explicit suicidal expression, despite high levels of distress, places it in the 'indicator' category.

""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope'."" ""I don't even know who I am anymore if I'm being honest."" These indicate feelings of isolation, hopelessness, self-worth issues, and internal conflict regarding life/death.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""Possible suicide date is in July."" This is a specific temporal plan, indicating a tendency to act out by setting a potential date. No specific method (e.g., tool, location) is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""Possible suicide date is in July.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the phrase ""Possible suicide date is in July"" and ""debating it because of my friends"" strongly implies a desire to die and an active consideration of suicide.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the mention of a ""Possible suicide date is in July"" indicates a specific temporal plan or a tendency to act out by setting a timeline.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Possible suicide date is in July"" refers to a future intention/plan.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""Possible suicide date is in July""). This rules out 'indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a ""Possible suicide date,"" which constitutes a plan (even if only temporal) or a clear tendency to act out suicide. It's not just thinking about it; it's considering a specific time for the action.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide..."" The mention of a specific date fits this definition.
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, which would classify it as 'attempt'.

Based on the explicit mention of suicide and the presence of a temporal plan (""Possible suicide date is in July""), the post falls into the 'behavior' category.

It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""makes me suicidal"", ""suicidal thoughts"", ""never kill myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""sad"", ""hurts so much"", ""loser"", ""never make friends"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""suicidal"", ""kill myself"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""makes me suicidal"", ""suicidal thoughts"". However, it also includes a strong negation of acting on these thoughts: ""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and thoughts. The future intention to act is explicitly negated.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""suicidal thoughts"", ""makes me suicidal""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a plan or tendency to commit suicide; in fact, the post explicitly states a reason *not* to commit suicide (""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person""). This indicates the presence of ideation without a plan or tendency to act.
   - There is no mention of historical or recent self-harm or suicide attempts, ruling out 'behavior' (which requires a plan/tendency or historical self-harm behavior) and 'attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'ideation' perfectly: explicit suicidal expression but no plan or tendency to commit suicide.

These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, self-blame, and extreme isolation.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve."" - This indicates a specific *time* for the action. ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" - This explicitly states *preparation* (suicide notes) and a heightened, current intention to act.
    *   **References to past attempts:** ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year"" - This refers to past *preparations* or *ideations with preparatory steps*, not past completed attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide notes"", ""ending it all"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm thinking of ending it all"", ""can't fucking do another year"".

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., tool, substance) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" indicates a temporal plan. ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"" indicates active preparation (writing notes) and a strong current intent to proceed.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both past struggles and preparations (""awful year"", ""made 3 other suicide notes"") and very clear current/future intentions (""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"", ""this is the one"", ""can't fucking do another year"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No, ""made 3 other suicide notes"" describes past preparatory *behaviors*, not completed attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""ending it all"", ""suicide notes"").
    *   It goes beyond mere ideation by indicating a ""plan or tendency to act out suicide"":
        *   A specific timeframe is given: ""on new year's eve"".
        *   Preparation is explicitly mentioned: ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one."" This indicates a current, serious intent to use a suicide note, which is a preparatory *behavior*.
        *   The phrase ""this is the one"" strongly implies a current, serious intent to proceed with the plan, distinguishing it from past notes that were not acted upon.
    *   The mention of ""made 3 other suicide notes this year"" also aligns with ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" in the context of preparatory actions for suicide.
    *   It does not describe a recent or historical *completed attempt*.

    Therefore, the presence of a temporal plan (""new year's eve"") and explicit preparation (""this is the one"" regarding the suicide note, and the history of writing them) places it in the 'behavior' category.

   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""cut myself"" (method of self-harm)
   - References to past attempts: ""tried to cut myself last night"" (description of a recent, past self-harm action). ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" indicates this was a first-time occurrence.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No. The act described is self-harm, not explicitly suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The motivation stated is ""wanted to feel something real.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut myself"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? The act implies means were available, but no explicit preparation is detailed.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""tried to cut myself last night"" refers to a past event.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, a past self-harm action is described.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes a past action of self-harm (""tried to cut myself last night"").
   - The definition of 'behavior' includes ""mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
   - The definition of 'attempt' includes ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt.""
   - The user's stated motivation (""wanted to feel something real"") and phrasing (""cut myself"") points more towards self-harm behavior rather than an explicit suicide attempt. Therefore, it fits the 'behavior' category which specifically covers historical self-harm.

   - However, the phrase ""plan to kill myself"" indicates a serious intention to act, which aligns with having a ""plan or tendency to act out"" as per the 'behavior' definition, even if the specific method is not detailed. It's a statement of an active intention to execute.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""plan to kill myself"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""plan to kill myself"", ""no purpose to live"").
   - The key distinction is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.
     - 'ideation' is ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
     - 'behavior' is ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - The statement ""I plan to kill myself"" directly indicates a ""plan or tendency to act out suicide"". It's not merely a thought or a wish to die (ideation), but a declared intention to undertake the act. While a specific method is not detailed, the explicit statement of ""plan to kill myself"" signifies a concrete decision and intention to act, fitting the ""plan or tendency to act out"" criteria for the 'behavior' category.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

    *   Emotional indicators: ""too much of a coward"" indicates a feeling of inability or fear to act on the desire to die, suggesting internal conflict and possibly despair.
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used, but ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die"" is a clear and direct expression.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No. The statement ""I'm too much of a coward to do it"" implies a *lack* of preparation or immediate intent to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current desire/intention (""I want to die"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I want to die"").
    *   However, it also explicitly states ""I'm too much of a coward to do it,"" which indicates there is no plan or immediate tendency to commit suicide.
    *   This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
    *   It does not fit 'indicator' because there is explicit suicidal expression.
    *   It does not fit 'behavior' because there is no plan or tendency to act out, nor mention of historical self-harm *behavior*.
    *   It does not fit 'attempt' because there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

But now i am at peace, no longer in pain, locked in the bathroom while my friends text me endlessly about how im ""ignoring"" them, but in reality i dont have the confidence to even say a word to them knowing it might as well be my last.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I'm gonna commit suicide"", ""twist my dick off"" (implies self-harm/mutilation), ""die of blood loss"".
   - Emotional indicators: Not explicitly stated, but the content suggests extreme distress and intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""twist my dick off"" (method), ""die of blood loss"" (outcome/method). ""I'm gonna wait it off"" suggests a timeline for the method. ""I'm gonna try here"" indicates immediate intent to act.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I'm gonna commit suicide"", ""die of blood loss""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by describing a specific, albeit unusual, method (""twist my dick off"", ""die of blood loss"") and a clear intention/tendency to act (""I'm gonna try here"", ""I'm gonna wait it off"").
   - It does not describe a past or recent suicide attempt, so it's not 'attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal expression combined with a described plan/method and a tendency to act out self-harm/suicide aligns directly with the definition of 'behavior'.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Sayonara"" (farewell, implying an end), ""I will eventually die in a much painful way"", ""no reason to live"". The phrase ""no reason to live"" is a strong indicator of suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""painful way"", ""physical pain"", ""mental depression"", ""lonely"", ""no reason to live"". These convey deep despair, hopelessness, and suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific suicide method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The dying is attributed to a ""disease"".
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Sayonara"" and ""I have no reason to live"" are direct expressions of wanting life to end or not continue.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific methods for *suicide* are mentioned. The post references dying from a disease.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No signs of preparation for suicide.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker"" (current/ongoing). ""I will eventually die"" (future, but attributed to disease). ""I endured... for years"" (past). ""I am lonely and have no reason to live"" (current state of mind). The ""no reason to live"" expresses a current desire for life to end.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire for life to end (""Sayonara"", ""no reason to live""). This aligns with ""explicit suicidal expression"".
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or method to *commit* suicide, nor any active tendency to act it out. The dying is presented as a consequence of disease, not an active self-inflicted act, but the desire for life to end is present.
   - There are no mentions of past suicide attempts or self-harm behavior.
   - Based on the definitions, 'indicator' is incorrect because there is explicit suicidal expression. 'Behavior' is incorrect because there is no plan or tendency to act out suicide. 'Attempt' is incorrect as no attempt is mentioned.
   - The post fits 'ideation' because it has explicit suicidal expression (""no reason to live"", ""Sayonara"") but lacks a concrete plan or tendency to commit suicide.

For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly states, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times."" It also expresses a feeling of being at the end of their coping ability: ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore."" The phrase ""the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother"" implies a struggle to stay alive.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""crushed by stress,"" ""cried myself to sleep,"" ""anxiety,"" ""crippled by stress and anxiety,"" ""no motivation,"" ""bottled up in me,"" ""I need help and I can't get it from anywhere."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""I thought of killing myself multiple times.""
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, implicitly through ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore"" and the past thoughts of suicide, combined with the statement about the brother being the only thing keeping them alive.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past suicidal thoughts (""thought of killing myself multiple times"") and current, escalating distress (""it has been getting much worse,"" ""I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore""), indicating ongoing suicidal ideation.
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I thought of killing myself multiple times"").
    *   There is no mention of a specific plan or method to commit suicide.
    *   There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts.
    *   The user expresses current distress and a feeling of being unable to cope, which aligns with ongoing suicidal thoughts rather than resolved issues.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""how to die"", ""definitely die"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I don't care if it's slow or painful or both"" indicates extreme desperation and disregard for personal well-being.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is actively seeking information on ""how to die"", which is a step towards identifying a method or forming a plan.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""how to die"", ""definitely die"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to definitely die"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned, but the user is explicitly asking ""Where can I find out how to die"", which indicates a search for a method or a plan. This is a clear tendency to act out by seeking means.
   - Are there signs of preparation? Seeking information on ""how to die"" is a preparatory step towards acquiring means or forming a plan.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and future intentions (""I just want to definitely die"", ""Where can I find out how to die"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I just want to definitely die"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by actively seeking information on ""how to die"". This search for a method or means constitutes a ""tendency to act out"" or a step towards forming a plan, as described in the 'behavior' category. It's not just thinking about suicide; it's actively looking for ways to do it.
   - There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, 'behavior' is the most appropriate category because it indicates explicit suicidal expression and a tendency to act out by seeking a method/plan.

While no specific method is detailed, there's a clear future intention and a belief in the success of a future attempt, indicating a level of planning or certainty.

    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"" indicates a future timeline and ""I've made enough plans to look forward to"" suggests a deliberate delaying action before a planned future event. The statement ""I'm not going to fail"" implies a certainty about a future, successful attempt, which often comes with planning.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both: a past suicide attempt (""if I do attempt again"") and future intentions/plans (""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"", ""I'm not going to fail""). The current state is one of persistent suicidal ideation and exhaustion.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression, ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It contains more than just ideation; there is a stated plan/tendency (""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"", ""I'm not going to fail"") and, critically, a mention of a past suicide attempt.
    *   The definition of 'behavior' states: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" This post fits the ""plan or tendency"" part.
    *   The definition of 'attempt' states: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" The phrase ""if I do attempt again"" directly matches ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"".
    *   Since the post explicitly mentions a *past suicide attempt*, the 'attempt' category is the most precise and severe classification according to the provided definitions, as it specifically covers historical suicide attempts. While elements might also fit 'behavior' (plan/tendency), the explicit mention of a past *suicide attempt* elevates it to the 'attempt' category.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

    *   It clearly mentions specific methods (""gun to the head"", ""kitchen knife"") and, more importantly, expresses a strong ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" (""Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there""). This goes beyond mere ideation (which has no plan or tendency to commit suicide).
    *   There is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
    *   The presence of explicit methods and the immediate urge/temptation to act places it firmly in the 'behavior' category.

   - Are there signs of preparation? No. The questions about inpatient care and medication are about seeking help, not preparing for an act.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The ""thoughts of suicide"" appear to be current or ongoing. The user is expressing a current struggle (""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"") and seeking information for future steps to address these thoughts.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
Based on the analysis:
- There is explicit suicidal expression (""thoughts of suicide"").
- However, there is no mention of a specific plan or a clear tendency to commit suicide. In fact, the user is actively seeking help (""Does inpatient care help?"", ""trying to find the courage to actually live"").
- There is no mention of past or recent attempts, nor any self-harm behavior.
This aligns directly with the definition of 'ideation'.

   - Emotional indicators: ""hard"", ""hardest decisions"".
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track"" (implies a specific method and a way to maintain focus on it). ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" (suggests active steps or overcoming mental barriers towards suicide). ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" (indicates planning for the aftermath, a concrete step related to the act).
   - References to past attempts: No explicit mention of past attempts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""when I do it"", ""before I go""). ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" refers to a recent step *towards* suicide, not a past attempt.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""kms"", ""when I do it"").
   - It goes beyond mere ideation by mentioning a specific method (""hangman's noose"") and demonstrating clear signs of planning and a tendency to act:
     - Setting the wallpaper to ""stay on track"" with the noose.
     - ""Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms"" implies active progression towards the act.
     - ""Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it"" indicates concrete planning for the outcome.
     - ""One of the hardest decisions I've taken in my life"" implies a decision has been made or is actively being finalized.
   - There is no mention of a past or recent suicide *attempt*.
   - Therefore, the post fits the ""behavior"" category, which includes explicit suicidal expression with a plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die,"" ""suicide note,"" and ""dying."" It details multiple past actions with the intent to die (aspirin overdose, gun purchase/attempt, rope/hanging attempt) and current preparations (""exit bag,"" ""turned that gas valve"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""scared,"" ""despair,"" ""numb,"" ""empty,"" ""panicked,"" ""lonely,"" ""anxious,"" ""sad,"" ""alone,"" ""exhausted.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   Past: ""120 extra strength aspirin pills,"" ""purchased a gun,"" ""found where to aim it,"" ""chambered my round,"" ""purchased rope,"" ""read up on partial suspension hanging,"" ""got into a remote location.""
        *   Current: ""I've made an exit bag,"" ""exit bag set up,"" ""turned that gas valve.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** Yes, the post provides detailed accounts of three distinct past suicide attempts:
        *   At 15: Aspirin overdose, leading to hospitalization.
        *   At 21: Gun purchase and attempt, leading to hospitalization.
        *   Recently: Rope/partial suspension hanging attempt, resulting in physical injury (""face purple and blotched"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes. The post uses the word ""suicide"" multiple times and describes actions taken with the intent to die.
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""desire to die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. Aspirin, gun, rope/hanging, and currently an ""exit bag"" with gas.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes. For past attempts: research, acquiring means, going to a remote location. For current: ""I've made an exit bag,"" ""exit bag set up,"" ""turned that gas valve.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. The post details multiple past *attempts* (""At 15, I took..."", ""At 21, I purchased..."", ""Just recently, I purchased rope... went with the plan""). It also describes current preparation and a very recent action (""Today, I have an exit bag set up,"" ""When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? Yes, in great detail, including the methods, circumstances, and outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, physical injury).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    The post clearly describes explicit suicidal expression, current plans/preparations, and a tendency to act. However, the most prominent and detailed aspect of the post is the recounting of multiple, distinct *historical suicide attempts* (aspirin overdose, gun incident, rope hanging). The definition for the 'attempt' category explicitly states: ""The post content has explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, *or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt*."" The detailed descriptions of the aspirin, gun, and rope incidents perfectly fit the ""mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt"" criterion. While there is also current preparation (which might lean towards 'behavior'), the explicit and extensive recounting of *past attempts* makes 'attempt' the most accurate and encompassing classification.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**

        *   'attempt' is not applicable as it does not describe a recent or historical attempt.
        *   'ideation' is defined as ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide."" The statement ""I'm about to kill myself"" clearly indicates a *tendency to commit suicide*, therefore, it does not fit the 'ideation' category based on this specific wording.
        *   'behavior' is defined as ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour."" The post has explicit suicidal expression and the statement ""I'm about to kill myself"" indicates a clear ""tendency to act out suicide.""

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" directly refers to death caused by a substance.
   - Emotional indicators: Implied distress, planning a potential future act.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""duloxetine"" (a specific medication/method). ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" indicates acquiring and storing means, which is a form of preparation for a future act.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, the question ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" in the context of ""saving for later"" strongly implies considering suicide by overdose.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not a direct statement, but the intent is clear from the combination of the question and the preparation.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""duloxetine"" (a specific drug).
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes, ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" indicates acquiring and holding onto the means.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""saving for later"" refers to a future intention. The question is current.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - 'indicator': Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal expression and preparation.
   - 'ideation': Not applicable, because there is a clear plan/tendency to act (saving pills, asking about lethality for a future purpose). 'Ideation' implies no plan or tendency.
   - 'behavior': This category fits well. There is explicit suicidal expression (implied intent to use duloxetine to die) and there is a clear ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" demonstrated by acquiring and ""saving"" the pills for a future purpose, along with inquiring about their lethality.
   - 'attempt': Not applicable, as there is no mention of a past or recent attempt.

Based on the explicit suicidal expression combined with the clear signs of preparation and intention to act (saving pills, asking about lethality), 'behavior' is the most appropriate category.

   - Emotional indicators: ""stop feeling this way"", ""It's hell"", ""Not anymore"", ""feel so empire"" (likely 'empty'), ""So out of place""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: ""haven't yet"" indicates a desire but no past attempt.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, not the word ""suicide"", but ""I just want to end"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Today's a great day. It's hell."" refers to current feelings. ""I just want to end but haven't yet."" refers to a current desire without past action or immediate future plan.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No. The phrase ""haven't yet"" explicitly states that no attempt has occurred.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I just want to end"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan or tendency to commit suicide. The phrase ""but haven't yet"" reinforces that the desire has not translated into action or a plan.
   - There is no mention of historical experience of self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - This fits the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""could be dead by the end of the day today"", ""cant off myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: The post conveys a sense of hopelessness and struggle (""Living by procrastination"", ""too tired to do the things I need to do"", ""distracts from life pretty well"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A method is thought about (""buy the gas""), but the post explicitly states the inability to act on it (""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas""). There are no signs of active preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""could be dead"", ""cant off myself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today.""

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""buy the gas"".
   - Are there signs of preparation? No, the post explicitly states the *lack* of preparation or ability to acquire the means due to fatigue/procrastination (""cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - This refers to current/future intentions (""could be dead by the end of the day today"") but emphasizes the *inability* to act on them due to ongoing fatigue and procrastination. There are no past attempts mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""ideation"").
   - A method is mentioned (""buy the gas""), but the post clearly states that the individual is *unable* to act on this method or develop a plan (""I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas""). The procrastination is presented as a barrier preventing action, not a step towards a plan.
   - Therefore, there is no ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" as required for the 'behavior' category. The thoughts are present, and a method is considered, but the execution is explicitly stated as being prevented by current circumstances (fatigue, not leaving the house).
   - It does not describe a past or recent attempt.
   - This fits the 'ideation' category: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

490,"I should stop being a pussy and do it. I post about suicide constantly, I should just suck it up and do it already.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""do it"" (referring to suicide), ""post about suicide constantly"", ""suck it up and do it already"".
   - Emotional indicators: Frustration, self-deprecation (""pussy""), a sense of urgency or pressure to act on suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None. ""Do it"" is vague.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts mentioned. Past *posting* about suicide is mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""post about suicide constantly"". The phrase ""do it"" in this context clearly refers to suicide.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrases ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" express a strong desire and internal pressure to act on suicidal thoughts.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""should stop"", ""should just suck it up and do it already"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression.
   - There is no specific plan or method mentioned, and no past attempt is described.
   - However, the phrases ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" indicate a strong internal pressure and *tendency to act out* the suicidal thoughts, moving beyond mere contemplation. This aligns with the ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" part of the 'behavior' category definition. It's not just ideation; it's an expressed urge to move to action.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself)"", ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January"", ""now it time to stop the lie and end it"", ""I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm done and happy"", ""felt like a big relief"", ""done with everything"", ""I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time."" The emotional state is complex, but the intent is clear.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""planned to kill myself in the forest in January"" (past plan), ""plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"" (current plan). ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"".
   - References to past attempts: ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't"". This explicitly states a past *plan* that was *not* acted upon, so it's not a past attempt. However, there is a clear mention of past *self-harm* (""I started to cut my rights leg more and more"").

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""hang myself"", ""end it"").
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""I'm done"", ""end it"").

   - Are specific methods mentioned? Yes (""hang myself in the highest tree of the forest"", ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"").
   - Are there signs of preparation? Yes (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"").

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
     - Past events: ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more"" (past self-harm behavior). ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't"" (past suicidal ideation/plan, not acted upon).
     - Current/future intentions: ""now it time to stop the lie and end it."" ""I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"". This indicates a clear current intention with a detailed plan and means.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I plan to hang myself"", ""end it"").
   - It details a specific plan (""hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"") and indicates preparation (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""). This falls under ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"".
   - It also mentions ""historical experience of self-harm behaviour"" (""I started to cut my rights leg more and more... it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself"").
   - The criteria for 'behavior' are met: ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide, or mentioned historical experience of self-harm behaviour.""
   - It does not describe a recent or historical suicide *attempt* (the past plan was not acted upon).

They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: What are the key elements in this post?
   - Identify any mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"", ""I wish I was never born"", ""don't really want to die"", ""no point for us being here"".
   - Note emotional indicators: Questioning the point of life, feeling it's ""the dumbest shit ever"", wishing they were never born, feeling there's ""no point"". These indicate existential despair, hopelessness, and a sense of meaninglessness.
   - Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - Check for references to past attempts: None.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No, the word ""suicide"" is not used.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wish I was never born"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive. However, it is immediately followed by ""but at the same time don't really want to die,"" indicating ambivalence. The statement ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"" questions the value of life itself.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current feelings and existential questioning. No past events or attempts are mentioned.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, which category fits best?
   - The post contains explicit expressions of not wanting to exist (""I wish I was never born"") and questioning the value of life. This constitutes explicit suicidal expression.
   - There is no mention of a plan, method, or tendency to act on these thoughts.
   - There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts.
   - The ambivalence (""don't really want to die"") indicates that while the ideation is present, there is no clear intent to act, nor a plan.
   - Therefore, the post fits the description of 'ideation' as it has explicit suicidal expression but no plan or tendency to commit suicide.

   - This refers to past actions (buying the item, starting Nofap) and current/future anxieties (starting a new school, fear of judgment). There are no references to past suicide attempts or current suicidal intentions.

5. CATEGORY REASONING: Based on the above analysis, the post expresses significant emotional distress (shame, fear, feeling disgusting) and asks for help regarding a social problem. However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, wanting to die, or any plans/behaviors related to suicide. The distress is related to social embarrassment and anxiety about future social interactions. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'indicator' as it has no explicit suicidal expression.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""kill yourself"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""they don't let you kill yourself"" implies a desire to do so, and ""why do you want me to suffer"" indicates a wish to end suffering, which is linked to wanting to die.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
Based on the analysis:
- There is explicit suicidal expression (""kill yourself"", desire to end suffering).
- There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation to act on these thoughts.
- There is no mention of historical self-harm or suicide attempts.
This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'ideation': ""The post content has explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post contains ""im going to do it"" (implying suicide in context) and ""pls fucking end me"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""lonely"", ""nobody fucking cares"", ""Nobody cares ever"", ""spoiled piece of shit"". These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and self-worth issues.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., tool, location, substance) is mentioned. No signs of preparation are noted.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""im going to do it"" and ""pls fucking end me"".
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""pls fucking end me"".

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:

   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/future intentions (""im going to do it"", ""pls fucking end me before the day"").
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post has explicit suicidal expression (""im going to do it"", ""pls fucking end me""). This rules out 'indicator'.
   - The post does not mention a past or recent suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - The distinction between 'ideation' and 'behavior' hinges on ""plan or tendency to commit suicide"" for ideation versus ""plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" for behavior.
   - While no specific *method* or *plan* is detailed, the phrase ""im going to do it"" is a direct declaration of intent to act, and ""pls fucking end me before the day"" implies urgency and a strong desire for action. This constitutes a ""tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" even without a concrete method specified. It goes beyond mere thoughts or wishes (ideation) to a stated intent to act.

Therefore, 'behavior' is the most fitting category due to the explicit statement of intent to act and the urgent plea, which indicates a ""tendency to act out"".

    *   **Emotional indicators:** Desire to avoid ""shame in the family"".
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Mentions ""stabbing"" as the desired method of death, framed as an external event. No active plan to self-harm, but a strong wish for a specific, violent end.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""with a suicide"".
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hope it'll be me next.""

    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal expression (""I hope it'll be me next"", ""with a suicide""), ruling out 'indicator'.
    *   It does not describe a recent or historical suicide attempt, ruling out 'attempt'.
    *   The choice is between 'ideation' and 'behavior'.
    *   'Ideation' is ""explicit suicidal expression but there is no plan or tendency to commit suicide.""
    *   'Behavior' is ""explicit suicidal expression and there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide...""
    *   The post expresses a strong, specific desire for a particular, violent method of death (""stabbing"") and hopes it happens soon. While not a *plan* to self-harm, the phrase ""I hope it'll be me next"" combined with the specific method and the explicit mention of ""suicide"" indicates a clear *tendency* towards ending their life in a specific, violent way, even if passively desired. This specificity and intensity of the death wish, linked to a method, goes beyond mere abstract ideation. It suggests a specific inclination or tendency towards a particular outcome.

While a specific *suicide method* isn't detailed, there is a clear *plan* to prepare the circumstances for suicide by disappearing and isolating themselves. This is a preparatory thought process.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes (""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all"").
    *   Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes (""want to put an end to it all"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *suicide* method (e.g., specific tool, substance) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation? Yes, the user is actively seeking advice on *how* to disappear (""how to run from everyone"", ""how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc"") specifically *in order to* commit suicide peacefully and secretly. This indicates a clear ""tendency to act out"" by planning the necessary pre-conditions for the act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?"", ""i want to put an end to it all"", ""how can i just disappear?"").
    *   Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal expression.
    *   **ideation:** While there is explicit suicidal expression, the post goes beyond mere thoughts. The user is actively seeking a *plan* or *method* to facilitate the act by disappearing and isolating themselves. This moves it beyond pure ideation.
    *   **behavior:** The post has explicit suicidal expression. There is a clear ""tendency to act out"" by asking for a specific plan to disappear and create the conditions for suicide. This is a form of preparatory planning, even if the final method is not chosen. The phrase ""there is plan or tendency to act out self-harm or suicide"" fits well here.
    *   **attempt:** Ruled out as there is no mention of a recent or historical suicide attempt.

Based on the analysis, the user's explicit suicidal expression combined with active questioning about *how* to achieve the necessary conditions (disappearing) to commit suicide points to a ""tendency to act out"" or a ""plan"" to facilitate the act, which aligns with the 'behavior' category.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:

This directly aligns with the definition of 'attempt' which includes ""explicit expression concerning recent suicide attempt, or mentioned historical experience of suicide attempt."" While the post also includes current plans for future attempts (which could fall under 'behavior'), the clear description of a *past suicide attempt* makes 'attempt' the most accurate and specific classification according to the provided categories.

   - Emotional indicators: ""Just don't want to get out of bed,"" ""soooo tired,"" ""feel empty,"" ""worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔"". These indicate fatigue, emptiness, and concern about a depressive relapse.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None.
   - References to past attempts: No past suicide attempts mentioned. ""another depressive episode"" refers to past experiences with depression, not suicidal acts.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Is suicide explicitly mentioned? No.
   - Are there direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. ""I just want to sleep 24/7"" indicates extreme fatigue/desire for escape, not a direct wish for death.

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - Are specific methods mentioned? No.
   - Are there signs of preparation? No.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to current feelings (""don't want to get out of bed,"" ""soooo tired,"" ""feel empty"") and future worries (""worried about ruining my friendships""). Mentions ""another depressive episode"" indicating a history of depression.
   - Are past attempts specifically described? No.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post describes symptoms consistent with depression (fatigue, emptiness, withdrawal, worry about relapse) but contains no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or wanting to die.
   - It also highlights positive aspects of the person's life, which suggests a struggle with mental health rather than a direct suicidal intent.
   - Based on the definitions: ""indicator"" states ""The post content has no explicit suicidal expression"". This aligns perfectly as there is no explicit suicidal expression, only signs of distress and potential depressive episode.
