*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** ""ending my life again"", ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"".
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""Never will find love,"" ""mental breakdown,"" ""everything in my life is crap even me,"" ""I wish I was even attractive enough for someone,"" ""I hate being gay and I hate being myself."" These indicate severe despair, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""go to a bridge and jump off"" is a specific method and location.
*   **References to past attempts:** ""ending my life again"" implies a past consideration or desire, but does not describe a past *initiated action* (attempt). It refers to the *thought* recurring.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""ending my life again"" and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" are explicit suicidal thoughts/desires.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' N/A, intent is clear.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump off a bridge.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No explicit preparation or action taken is mentioned.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' The specific plan ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" indicates a concrete desire to act on a method, moving beyond mere ideation.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current thoughts and future intentions (""Kind of thinking about ending my life again,"" ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No. ""ending my life again"" refers to the *thought* or *desire* recurring, not a past initiated action.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""ending my life again"") and a specific plan/method (""I want to go to a bridge and jump off""). This combination fits the definition of 'Behavior', which includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan or method. It does not describe a past *initiated action* to qualify as 'Attempt'. It goes beyond mere 'Ideation' due to the specific plan.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Key elements:** ""inconsolable"" (emotional distress), ""I'm going to die soon"" (strong implication of wanting to end one's life).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""inconsolable"" indicates severe despair and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""I'm going to die soon"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent, indicating a desire for death.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'm going to die soon"" directly implies a desire for death.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: Severe distress (""inconsolable"") combined with ""I'm going to die soon"" clearly indicates implied suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? ""Soon"" indicates a timeframe, but it's not specific enough (like ""tonight"" or ""now"") to push it into 'Behavior' without a plan or action. It expresses a strong desire for death without detailing *how* or *when* precisely in a way that suggests immediate action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm going to die soon"").
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses a clear, strongly implied suicidal thought (""I'm going to die soon"") combined with severe distress (""inconsolable"").
    *   It does not describe a specific plan, method, preparations, or actions taken, nor does it refer to a past attempt.
    *   This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., 'I want to die,' 'I’m going to die soon') without specific plans or actions."" The provided example for 'Ideation' is also ""I’m inconsolable. I’m going to die soon.""

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
- The post expresses strong negative feelings about life (""I hate living"").
- It contains a rhetorical question about existence (""sometime i think about why i have to live until now""), implying a desire for life to end or a questioning of its value.
- There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
- Emotional indicators include despair and frustration (""fuck"").

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""I hate living"" strongly implies a desire not to be alive. ""why i have to live until now"" further questions the necessity of continued existence.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I hate living.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? No.
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, ""sometime i think about"" suggests recurring thoughts rather than immediate action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/recurring thoughts and feelings (""sometime i think about"").
- Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
- The post clearly expresses a desire not to live (""I hate living"") and suicidal thoughts (""sometime i think about why i have to live until now""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
- However, it lacks any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing, which would classify it as 'Behavior'.
- It does not describe a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
- Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without concrete steps or plans.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide**: ""kill myself"" is explicitly stated.
*   **Emotional indicators**: The plea for ""help"" implies severe distress and desperation.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: ""barbiturates/Nembutal"" is a specific method. The request ""help me find"" indicates an active step towards acquiring the means, which is a preparation.
*   **References to past attempts**: None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicit.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Help me kill myself.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""barbiturates/Nembutal.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""help me find"" implies an active step towards acquiring the means, which is a form of preparation or action taken towards the plan.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The direct plea for help to ""kill myself"" and find specific drugs suggests a strong, current intent to act.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Help me kill myself,"" ""help me find"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly states suicidal intent (""kill myself"") and includes a specific method (""barbiturates/Nembutal"") along with a request for assistance in obtaining them. This request to ""find"" the drugs constitutes a preparation or action taken towards the suicidal act. This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', which includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan/method or preparations/actions taken. It goes beyond mere ideation by including a concrete method and an active step to acquire it. It does not describe a past attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever""). However, it does not mention a specific plan, method, preparations, or an imminent timeframe. It's a contemplation of death and a desire to find a way to die painlessly, which fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions."" It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) but does not include a plan or action (Behavior) or a past attempt (Attempt).

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly mentions ""want to kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" and questions ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves."" It repeatedly discusses the idea of life being pointless and the desire to end it.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""pointless,"" ""huge waste of time."" The underlying emotion is a sense of nihilism and despair regarding the meaning of life, which leads to suicidal thoughts.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. The phrases ""want to kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" and ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"" are explicit.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No. The language is philosophical and reflective (""why shouldnt *we* just kill ourselves,"" ""I still have this feeling that I should do it anyways""), indicating persistent thoughts rather than an immediate plan or action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current, persistent thoughts and feelings (""for a year straight I was constantly thinking,"" ""I still have this feeling"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and desires (""want to kill myself,"" ""want to die"") but lacks any mention of specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent. It describes a persistent state of suicidal ideation stemming from a sense of meaninglessness. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation'. It goes beyond 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal intent, but does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (no plan/action/imminent intent) or 'Attempt' (no past attempt described).

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it""). Crucially, it includes strong intent with imminent timing (""tonight""), which, according to the definitions, moves it beyond 'Ideation' and into 'Behavior' even without a specific method. The definition for 'Behavior' states: ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts plus either: ... (3) strong intent with imminent timing (e.g., 'I want to be gone tonight') even without a method."" This post perfectly matches this criterion. It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'. It is far more than general distress, so not 'Indicator'.

*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains an explicit mention of suicidal thoughts (""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself""). However, it immediately follows with a clear denial of intent or desire (""but I don't actually want to""). The post describes intrusive thoughts causing distress, tiredness, and loneliness, rather than a genuine desire to end one's life. According to the definitions:
*   'Ideation' requires explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts *or feelings*, which typically implies a desire or intent to die, even if passive. The explicit negation of wanting to die (""but I don't actually want to"") differentiates this from ideation.
*   'Indicator' is defined as lacking explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent, showing general distress, sadness, or vague references to death ""without a clear desire to die."" While the thought is explicit, the *desire* to act on it is explicitly absent. The distress stems from the intrusive nature of the thoughts, not from a desire to die. Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category as it shows significant distress and the *presence* of suicidal thoughts without the *intent* or *desire* to act on them.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

*   **Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")?** No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains a strong, implied expression of suicidal thought (""I'd leave myself if I could"") which indicates a desire for non-existence or to not be alive. This goes beyond general distress or vague references to death, placing it beyond 'Indicator'. However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing, which rules out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most fitting category as it describes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without concrete steps.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""i plan to kill myself at 21."" It also contains strong expressions of hopelessness and despair (""this is very unhealthy,"" ""it's not fixable, there is no hope,"" ""this is hell."").
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with indicators of severe distress, including ""not ok,"" ""severely codependent,"" ""can't think for myself,"" ""no sense of self,"" ""constant anxiety, self doubt, and mistrust,"" ""feel really small, like a child,"" ""apathy and passive,"" ""no creativity,"" ""constant loneliness,"" ""anhedonic and dissociative,"" and ""braindead.""
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific *timing* for a plan is mentioned (""at 21""), but no specific *method* (e.g., pills, jumping) or *preparations* (e.g., writing a note, gathering items) are described.
*   **References to past attempts:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes**, ""i plan to kill myself at 21.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes**, the explicit statement of planning suicide, coupled with phrases like ""it's not fixable, there is no hope,"" and ""this is hell.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? **No**. The intent is explicitly dated for the future (""at 21,"" while the user is 18 now).

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a **future intention/plan** (""i plan to kill myself at 21"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? **No**.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
*   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there is explicit suicidal intent and a stated plan.
*   **Ideation:** While there are strong suicidal thoughts, the post includes a ""specific plan"" regarding the timing (""at 21""). The definition of Ideation states ""without specific plans or actions."" The explicit future plan moves it beyond mere ideation.
*   **Behavior:** This category applies when there are suicidal thoughts *plus* a specific plan or method, preparations, or imminent intent. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a ""specific plan"" regarding the timing (""at 21""). Although it lacks a method or imminent timing, the explicit declaration of a future-dated plan (""at 21"") fits the ""specific plan"" criterion of the Behavior category. It's a concrete decision for a future action, not just a vague thought.
*   **Attempt:** Ruled out as there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? **No.** The repeated phrases ""I don't really have the guts to do it"" and ""I can't seem to go through with it"" indicate a lack of imminent intent or ability to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   It mentions a specific method (""hanging"") but immediately qualifies it with a clear statement of *inability* to act or go through with it (""I don't have the guts,"" ""I can't seem to go through with it"").

This ranges from passive thoughts... to stronger desires to end life, but stops short of concrete steps."" The mention of a method that cannot be acted upon falls under ""stops short of concrete steps.""

The desire to kill oneself persists (""My desire to kill myself has not [died down]"") and there's a willingness to die (""I'd honestly choose that at this point""), indicating ongoing ideation, but not a *new* imminent action or plan.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. The post describes current/ongoing suicidal ideation (""My desire to kill myself has not"") and explicitly details *past* suicide attempts (""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, clear descriptions of past attempts (""attempted an overdose"").

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post clearly describes *past suicide attempts*. The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" This post fits perfectly as it explicitly mentions multiple past attempts and also expresses ongoing suicidal ideation.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" refers to a medical/identity need, not a desire to end life. There are no strong implications of wanting to end one's life.
*   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme fear (""fucking horrified,"" ""so fucking scared""), panic (""panic attacks""), despair (""too much,"" ""going insane""), worry, shame.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No. The post expresses overwhelming distress and fear related to perceived health issues and family judgment, but not a desire to die.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly conveys severe distress, fear, and feeling overwhelmed (""going insane,"" ""too much,"" ""so fucking scared""). However, it lacks any explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent. The focus is on coping with perceived health problems and family issues, not on ending life. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator', which describes general distress without a clear desire to die, and where severe hopelessness alone isn't enough to move beyond this category.

I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method for suicide is mentioned (e.g., ""I'll take pills,"" ""I'll jump""). The post states, ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet,"" indicating no action has been taken *yet* towards suicide.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The ""cuts I have all over myself"" refers to past/ongoing self-harm, but it is not described as a suicide *attempt*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No. ""I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet.""
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes. ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" This strongly suggests imminent intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current distress, recent suicidal thoughts, and future intentions (""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""this will probably be my last post ever"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No. The cuts are self-harm, not described as an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** While there are explicit suicidal thoughts, the post goes beyond mere thoughts. The phrase ""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."" indicates a strong, imminent intent, which moves it beyond passive or active ideation alone.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I'm going to kill myself"") and demonstrates ""strong intent with imminent timing"" (""this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye."") even without a specific method or preparations. The user is at a critical decision point, and the farewell implies a potential immediate action.
    *   **Attempt:** Not applicable, as no past initiated suicidal action is described.

*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No. The post explicitly states ""i just can't commit to it.""
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, the lack of commitment (""can't commit to it"") and the distance to the location (""4-5km"") indicate no imminent intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and consideration of a future, but uncommitted, action. No past attempts.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal,"" ""kill myself""). It also mentions a specific method (""a good clif"") and its feasibility (""possible to get there""). However, the crucial phrases ""i can't kill myself"" and ""i just can't commit to it"" indicate a clear *lack of commitment or intent to act* on the thought or method. While a method is identified, the absence of a firm plan, preparations, or imminent intent means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. It falls squarely into 'Ideation' because it describes strong suicidal thoughts and consideration of a method, but without the active planning or commitment required for 'Behavior'.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, ""Well shit how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"". This is a direct rhetorical question implying a desire to die.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""depressed 16 year old"", feeling unaccepted (""catering to the interests of others and stripping yourself of individuality"", ""family doesn't like a depressed 16 year old, but doesn't even deal with him""). Shows despair, hopelessness, and feeling unwanted.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** No references to past attempts.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""how about i die then"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""how about i die then"".

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No, the phrase ""how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"" is a rhetorical question expressing a thought or desire, not an indication of immediate action or a specific timeline.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current/future intentions, expressed as a rhetorical question.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""how about i die then"") which goes beyond general distress, ruling out 'Indicator'. However, it does not include any specific plan, method, preparations, or strong indication of imminent action, which would be required for 'Behavior'. It also does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'. The explicit expression of wanting to die without concrete plans or actions fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Key elements:**
        *   ""killing myself will happen,"" ""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life"": Explicit and definitive statements of suicidal intent.
        *   ""There is no hope. All is lost."": Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair.
        *   ""I have this on my computer wallpaper now. It is my daily reminder that killing myself will happen."": Suggests a constant reinforcement of the suicidal thought, but not a physical preparation for an act.
        *   ""Nothing anyone can do or say can save my life save for someone putting $1,000,000 in my bank account or if I were to win the lottery."": Reinforces the definitive nature of the intent, as the conditions for not dying are highly improbable.
        *   ""When it will happen I am unsure, but I do know that I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023)."": Indicates a future intention, but lacks imminence or a specific timeframe for the act itself.
        *   ""It is pointless, meaningless, and a waste of energy to even keep trying. At least I DID try."": Expresses a sense of futility and past efforts to cope, not past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""killing myself will happen,"" ""taking my own life.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No specific physical preparations or actions taken. The wallpaper is a mental reinforcement, not a physical step towards an attempt.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, the user states ""When it will happen I am unsure"" and provides a vague future timeframe (""not live to see my 40th birthday"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and future intentions (""will happen,"" ""will be taking,"" ""will not live"").
    *   Are past attempts described? No. ""At least I DID try"" refers to trying to live, not a suicide attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit and very strong suicidal thoughts and intent (""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life""). This immediately rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   It does *not* describe a past suicide attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
    *   It lacks a specific plan or method, concrete preparations/actions, or imminent timing. While the intent is very high, the absence of these elements prevents it from being classified as 'Behavior'. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a specific plan/method, preparations/actions taken, or strong intent *with imminent timing*. The post explicitly states the timing is ""unsure.""
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' because it expresses explicit and strong suicidal thoughts and desires (""stronger desires to end life"") but ""stops short of concrete steps"" (i.e., specific plans, methods, or imminent actions).

*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific current plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The ""perfect opportunity"" 6 months ago is not detailed as a method or action.
*   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a past *missed opportunity* to kill oneself (""I had the perfect opportunity... and I was a pussy. I shouldn't have talked myself down""). This implies that the person *did not initiate* a concrete action; rather, they *prevented* themselves from doing so by ""talking myself down."" This does not meet the definition of an 'Attempt', which requires a concrete action to have been initiated.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicit.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No, not for current intent.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No, ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"" suggests ongoing desire rather than immediate, imminent action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to a past *missed opportunity* and ongoing *current desire* (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No, the post describes *not* acting on an opportunity (""I shouldn't have talked myself down""), which means a concrete action was *not initiated*. This does not fit the definition of an 'Attempt'.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit, ongoing suicidal thoughts and desires (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"") and regret over a past missed opportunity to die. However, it does not describe a current specific plan, method, or preparation, nor does it describe a past *initiated* suicide attempt (as the action was prevented by ""talking myself down""). This fits the definition of 'Ideation', which includes explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions.

    *   It *lacks* any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent, a desire to die, or any thoughts about ending life. The focus is on the pain of the social dynamic and self-perception, not on death or suicide.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

*   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm scared,"" ""I worry,"" ""tired of always being afraid and upset over little things,"" ""tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation,"" ""live every moment in shame."" These indicate significant distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" is a strong implication/euphemism for suicidal thoughts.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the ""sewer slide"" thoughts, combined with ""it's tempting a lot of the time,"" directly imply a desire to end life.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: Severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The emotional distress is severe, and the implied intent is clear.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, it describes recurring thoughts (""still get the... thoughts,"" ""tempting a lot of the time"") rather than an immediate plan or timing.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/ongoing thoughts and feelings.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly conveys suicidal thoughts through the euphemism ""'lol kermit sewer slide' thoughts"" and states that these thoughts are ""tempting a lot of the time."" However, it does not describe a specific plan, method, preparations, actions taken, or imminent intent. This fits the definition of 'Ideation', which covers explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts without concrete steps towards an attempt.

Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it?

It also includes a specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and indicates a strong desire to act on these thoughts (""It's looking pretty good,"" ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?""). The mention of ""end of life stuff"" shows consideration of practical steps related to a plan, even if they are currently obstacles.

- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly states suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself,"" ""everyone would be better off with me dead"") coupled with intense emotional distress. However, it does not describe a specific plan, method, preparations, or a past attempt. It fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or actions. It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no specific plan, method, or clear imminent timing beyond the general expression of desire.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   **Indicator**: This category is too low, as there is explicit suicidal ideation with a specific method.
*   **Ideation**: While it includes suicidal thoughts, the definition of Ideation states ""without specific plans or actions."" This post *does* include a specific method (""slitting my wrists"").
*   **Behavior**: The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""thought about slitting my wrists"") *plus* a specific plan or method (""slitting my wrists""). Even though no action was taken (""but i didnt do it""), the presence of a specific method within the thought aligns with the ""Behavior"" definition's first criterion: ""(1) a specific plan or method.""
*   **Attempt**: This category is incorrect because the post explicitly states ""but i didnt do it,"" meaning no action was initiated.

The presence of a specific method (""slitting my wrists"") within the suicidal thought, even if not acted upon, elevates it from general Ideation to Behavior, according to the provided definitions.

I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""suicidal feelings"" directly implies a desire or thought of ending one's life.

While the user expresses doubt about the efficacy of these methods, they are explicitly named and discussed as potential means to die. This detailed consideration of specific methods, even with uncertainty, aligns with the 'Behavior' category, which includes ""a specific plan or method"" even if not fully decided or acted upon.

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No. The post discusses the possibility of admitting oneself to a psych ward and mentions being ""scared of messing it up,"" which suggests hesitation and a lack of imminent intent rather than a strong push towards immediate action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current feelings (""I want to die"") and future considerations (admitting self to a psych ward).
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""I want to die""). However, it explicitly states the *absence* of a specific plan (""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"") and does not describe any actions taken or imminent intent. The fear of ""messing it up"" also indicates a barrier to action rather than active planning or behavior. This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation', which involves explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or actions. It goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicidal intent. It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there is no specific plan, action, or imminent timing. It does not meet 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide**: ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" strongly implies suicidal intent related to taking all pills.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""coward,"" ""living a life nobody loves or cares for me in"" indicate severe self-loathing, hopelessness, and loneliness.
*   **Specific plans/methods/preparations**: ""count my pills"" explicitly mentions a method (pills) and a recurring preparatory action (counting them). ""take them all"" refers to the intended action with the method.
*   **References to past attempts**: The phrase ""why i didnt take them all"" indicates that an attempt *did not* happen, or at least was not completed. It's a reflection on *not* having acted, rather than a description of an initiated attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""take them all"" in the context of counting pills is a strong implication of suicide.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the regret over *not* taking them all, combined with the despair about their life, implies a desire to end it.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""pills.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""every night i count my pills"" is a clear, recurring preparatory action linked to the method.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? While not explicitly ""tonight,"" the daily/nightly routine of counting pills and wondering why they haven't been taken all suggests a strong, ongoing contemplation and engagement with the method.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""every night i count my pills"" and ""every day i wonder"" indicate ongoing, current behavior and contemplation. It refers to a past *inaction* (""why i didnt take them all"") but the *wondering* is current and implies a strong desire for that action. It is not describing a past completed or interrupted attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""wonder why i didnt take them all"") and identifies a specific method (""pills""). Crucially, it describes a recurring, preparatory action related to this method (""every night i count my pills""). This goes beyond mere ideation into the realm of concrete actions or preparations linked to a suicidal plan, even if the final act hasn't occurred. It does not describe a past initiated attempt. Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category.

I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""death,"" or ""dying."" However, ""The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately,"" ""major downward spiral,"" and ""Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle"" indicate severe internal distress. The phrase ""I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again"" is a very strong implication. People are typically admitted to a psych ward for severe mental health crises, often involving suicidal ideation or attempts. This strongly suggests the ""unbearably strong thoughts"" are suicidal in nature.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""unbearably strong,"" ""major downward spiral,"" ""struggle,"" ""secret,"" ""don't know what to do."" These convey extreme hopelessness, despair, and a feeling of being overwhelmed.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The phrase ""don't want to end up in the psych ward again"" indicates a past hospitalization for a mental health crisis. While this *could* have been due to an attempt, the post does not *describe* a past attempt or any action taken. It only describes the consequence (hospitalization).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied?** No explicit mention. However, the combination of ""unbearably strong thoughts,"" a ""major downward spiral,"" and the fear of being in the ""psych ward again"" (a place often associated with severe suicidal ideation or behavior) *strongly implies* suicidal thoughts. The ""thoughts"" are not just general sadness but are described as ""unbearably strong"" and leading to a ""downward spiral,"" suggesting a severe, persistent internal struggle with suicidal ideation.
    *   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Not directly stated (""I want to die""), but the overall context of severe, unmanageable thoughts and past hospitalization for a mental health crisis (implied by ""psych ward again"") points to an underlying desire to escape the pain, which often translates to suicidal ideation.
    *   **If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.'** The distress is severe. The implied intent comes from the nature of the ""unbearably strong thoughts"" and the past ""psych ward"" experience, making it more than just general distress.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation or actions taken?** No.
    *   **Does the post suggest imminent intent?** No. It talks about ""lately,"" ""past few months,"" and ""Everyday,"" not immediate timing.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to current struggles (""lately,"" ""past few months,"" ""Everyday waking up... is such a struggle"") and a current fear (""don't want to end up in the psych ward again""). It mentions a past hospitalization, but does not *describe* a past suicide attempt.
    *   **Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones?** No. Only a past hospitalization is mentioned, not the actions of an attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because the ""unbearably strong thoughts"" combined with the fear of returning to the ""psych ward"" *strongly imply* suicidal ideation, even without explicit ""I want to die"" statements.
    *   It does not include specific plans, methods, preparations, actions taken, or imminent timing, so it does not fit 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past suicide attempt, only a past hospitalization, so it does not fit 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' due to the strong implication of suicidal thoughts without concrete plans or actions.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
- The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die and having lost the will to live. This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
- However, there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or descriptions of an imminent action, which differentiates it from 'Behavior'.
- There is no description of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
- Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and feelings without specific plans or actions.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains explicit and strong expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I don't want to live anymore,"" ""when i off myself"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The phrasing ""i know that i'm going to end up... killing myself"" suggests a future likelihood or certainty, not an immediate or imminent intent (e.g., it doesn't say ""tonight"" or ""now""). It's a prediction of a future action based on current circumstances, not a concrete plan for immediate execution.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

This constitutes explicit/strongly implied suicidal thoughts and feelings. However, it does not include a specific plan, method, preparations, actions taken, or imminent timing that would elevate it to 'Behavior'.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post states ""I have overdosed,"" which is a clear self-harm action. The phrase ""I just want my suffering to be over"" implies a desire to escape pain, a common motivation for suicidal actions.

*   **Emotional indicators:** ""I regret everything,"" ""I regret it. I also don't,"" ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over,"" ""punish me for being such a nuisance,"" ""I'm sorry."" These indicate regret, ambivalence, suffering, self-blame, and apology.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I have overdosed."" ""I took 500mg Zoloft."" These are specific methods and actions taken.
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** ""I finally went through. I have overdosed."" This describes an action that has already been initiated and completed (overdosed). ""It hasn't been that long, but I'm getting a headache..."" describes the immediate aftermath of the action.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""I have overdosed"" is a direct statement of a self-harm action. While the user states ""it won't kill me,"" the act of overdosing with the intent to ""punish"" and end ""suffering"" is a concrete self-injurious action.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? ""I just want my suffering to be over"" is an implied expression of wanting to end current pain, which often underlies suicidal ideation or actions.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""I took 500mg Zoloft.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I finally went through. I have overdosed."" This describes an action that has already occurred.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a past event that has just occurred: ""I finally went through. I have overdosed."" The user describes the immediate physical effects of this past action.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, the post describes an overdose that has already taken place. The definition of 'Attempt' includes ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions."" Even if the user states the overdose ""won't kill me,"" the action itself was initiated with self-harm intent (""punish me,"" ""suffering to be over"").

This strong intent with a temporal component (""in the near future"") and a declaration of readiness to act (""I'm ready"") aligns with the 'Behavior' category's criteria of ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method.""
- There is no description of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states ""when my old high school found out i was suicidal"". This is a direct reference to a past state of being suicidal.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses frustration and anger (""counselors suck"", ""what the hell"") about how a past situation was handled.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""i was suicidal"" in the past, implying past ideation, but does not describe a suicide *attempt*.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""i was suicidal"" is explicitly mentioned.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not for the *current* moment. The expression ""i was suicidal"" refers to a past state (""it was 4 yrs ago""). The current post is about frustration over a past event.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, the event is clearly stated as being ""4 yrs ago"".

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a past event (""it was 4 yrs ago"", ""when my old high school found out i was suicidal""). There is no indication of current suicidal thoughts or intentions.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No, it describes a past state of being ""suicidal"" (ideation), not a past *attempt*.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" but it refers to a past state (""i *was* suicidal... it was 4 yrs ago""). The current content of the post expresses frustration and anger about how a past mental health issue was mishandled. There are no explicit or strongly implied expressions of *current* suicidal intent, thoughts, plans, or actions. Since there is no indication of current suicidal ideation, behavior, or an attempt, and the mention of ""suicidal"" is historical context for a complaint, the post falls into the 'Indicator' category, as it lacks current suicidal intent.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No. The phrasing ""Should I just..."" and ""Might as well just die"" indicates contemplation rather than imminent action.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: Yes. ""i should die,"" ""made up my mind to kill myself.""
    *   **Emotional indicators**: Yes. Self-loathing (""I am just rubbish sucking at everything""), despair (""I don't think it makes any sense that they have to raise me""), loneliness (""I have no friends""), anger/frustration (""I hate my family,"" ""fuck"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: Yes. ""tho I have prepared everything."" This indicates concrete steps taken towards an action.
    *   **References to past attempts**: No. The phrase ""made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything"" refers to a decision and preparation, not an *initiated* past attempt that was stopped or failed.

    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The combination of ""made up my mind"" and ""prepared everything"" suggests strong, decided intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a decision made ""a few days"" ago and preparations that are complete, indicating current readiness for a future action. It does not describe a past *attempt* that was initiated and then stopped.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and intent (""i should die,"" ""made up my mind to kill myself"").
    *   Crucially, it mentions ""prepared everything,"" which constitutes a specific preparation or action taken, moving it beyond mere ideation.
    *   It does not describe a past initiated action that was interrupted or completed, so it is not an 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category, which includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus preparations or actions taken.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The phrase ""I'm this fucking close"" suggests strong, current intent and proximity to action, but it does not specify a concrete imminent timing (like ""tonight"") that would typically push it into 'Behavior' without a method. It indicates a strong desire and feeling of being near the edge, but not a concrete step towards an action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions (""I want to die,"" ""I give up now"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit and strong expressions of suicidal thoughts and feelings (""I want to die,"" ""I give up now,"" ""I'm this fucking close""). However, it does not detail any specific plans, methods, preparations, or concrete actions taken. While ""I'm this fucking close"" indicates high distress and strong intent, it falls short of providing a specific method or an explicit imminent timeline for an action that would classify it as 'Behavior'. It clearly goes beyond general distress (Indicator) and does not describe a past attempt (Attempt). Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Ideation' due to the explicit and strong suicidal thoughts without concrete plans or actions.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Key elements**: The post explicitly mentions ""oxy and cutting an artery,"" which are specific, lethal methods of self-harm/suicide. The question ""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?"" directly inquires about the practical execution of these methods, specifically concerning pain management during the act.
    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask"" indicates distress, isolation, and a search for information related to these methods.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: Yes, ""oxy and cutting an artery"" are highly specific methods. The question about combining them for pain reduction suggests a detailed consideration of *how* to carry out such an act.
    *   **References to past attempts**: No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""cutting an artery"" is a direct and lethal method, strongly implying suicidal intent. The inquiry about pain reduction during this act further reinforces this implication.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the detailed inquiry into the practicalities of a lethal method strongly implies a desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""oxy"" (implying overdose) and ""cutting an artery."" These are concrete and lethal methods.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No explicit actions taken or preparations mentioned (e.g., ""I bought the oxy""). However, the detailed question about combining methods for pain reduction during the act goes beyond passive ideation and suggests active consideration of a specific plan's execution.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? Not explicitly ""tonight,"" but the focus on *how* to perform the act (pain reduction during execution) indicates a level of planning or detailed consideration that moves beyond general thoughts.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future consideration of a specific act.
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   **Indicator**: This is too specific for 'Indicator'. It goes far beyond general distress or vague references to death.
    *   **Ideation**: While it involves suicidal thoughts, it's more than just ""I want to die."" The post details specific methods (""oxy and cutting an artery"") and asks a practical question about their execution (pain reduction). This level of detail about *how* to carry out a lethal act moves it beyond simple ideation.
    *   **Behavior**: This category fits best. The post includes strongly implied suicidal thoughts (""cutting an artery"" and asking about pain reduction for it) and explicitly mentions ""a specific plan or method"" (""oxy and cutting an artery""). The inquiry about pain reduction during the act suggests a detailed consideration of the execution of this specific plan, bridging thoughts and potential actions.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" multiple times. However, these are direct quotes from the friend (""my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself"") or hypothetical scenarios used by the user to illustrate their hurt (""If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide""). The user themselves does not express a desire to die or end their life. Instead, they state, ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses significant hurt, upset, feeling that their friend has no faith in them, feeling like a doormat, and difficulty confronting their friend. This indicates general distress and interpersonal conflict, not necessarily suicidal despair or hopelessness about their own life ending.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned by the user.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None by the user. The friend's statement is a prediction about the user's future, not a reference to the user's past actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")?** Yes, the words ""kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" are present. However, they are *not* expressions of the user's own suicidal intent. They are reported speech from a friend or used in a hypothetical context to express the user's hurt feelings.
    *   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The user is asking for advice on how to handle a hurtful comment from a friend and navigate a difficult social situation.
    *   **If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.'** The user is in severe distress, but the distress is clearly about their friend's words and the impact on their friendship, not about their own suicidal thoughts or intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation or actions taken?** No.
    *   **Does the post suggest imminent intent?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")?** The friend's comment was ""a couple of weeks ago."" The user is currently processing it and seeking advice on how to address it with the friend. There are no current or future suicidal intentions expressed by the user.
    *   **Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post describes general distress and hurt feelings stemming from a friend's insensitive comment about suicide. While the word ""suicide"" is present, it is not an expression of the user's own suicidal intent or desire to die. The user explicitly states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness."" The core of the post is seeking advice on interpersonal conflict and emotional boundaries, not about personal suicidal thoughts or actions. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it shows general distress without explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent from the person writing the post.

71,"please please please help me. please help im at my window right now with scissors, i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out. i dont know what to do- im only a teen, my parents and siblings are asleep. i dont know what to do-",2,behavior,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
- Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life: The phrase ""jump out"" from a window strongly implies suicidal intent.
- Emotional indicators: ""please please please help me"", ""i feel like im about to"", ""i dont know what to do-"" indicate extreme distress, fear, and a plea for intervention.
- Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""at my window right now with scissors"", ""cut the screen and jump out"" describe a specific location, a tool, and an imminent action.
- References to past attempts: None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""jump out"" is a strong implication of wanting to die by suicide.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the described action is a means to end life.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""jump out"" from ""my window"".
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""at my window right now with scissors"" and the intent to ""cut the screen"" are clear signs of preparation and imminent action.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent? Yes, ""right now"", ""feel like im about to"" clearly indicate imminent intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions, specifically ""right now"" and ""im about to"".
- Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post goes beyond mere thoughts (Ideation) by including a specific method (""jump out"" from ""my window""), preparations (""at my window right now with scissors"", ""cut the screen""), and clear imminent intent (""right now"", ""feel like im about to""). It does not describe a past, initiated action that was stopped or completed (Attempt). Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

72,i'm gonna overdose on iron pills. i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it. i'm sorry,2,behavior,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death/suicide/self-harm**: ""i'm gonna overdose on iron pills"" explicitly states an intent to die by suicide using a specific method.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it"" shows severe distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape pain. ""i'm sorry"" indicates remorse or apology.
*   **Specific plans/methods/preparations**: ""overdose on iron pills"" is a specific method.
*   **Past attempts**: No mention of past attempts.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""i'm gonna overdose on iron pills"" is an explicit statement of suicidal intent.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i don't wanna deal with it"" implies a desire to escape life's pain through death.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""iron pills"" and ""overdose.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? The post states intent (""i'm gonna overdose"") with a specific method, which falls under having a specific plan. It doesn't state action *taken*, but the plan is clear.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The phrasing ""i'm gonna"" suggests a current decision and intent to act, and a method is provided.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""i'm gonna overdose"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""i'm gonna overdose"") and provides a specific method (""iron pills""). This moves it beyond mere 'Ideation' (which is thoughts without a plan) and into 'Behavior' (which includes explicit thoughts plus a specific plan or method). It does not describe a past action, so it is not 'Attempt'.

CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, ""im going to kill myself one day,"" ""might as well die,"" ""run away to a forest and fucking die.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** Severe hopelessness, despair, feeling like a failure, hatred, loneliness, desire to disappear.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" describes a specific scenario/method for ending life.
*   **References to past attempts:** No.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: Severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' (This post is clearly beyond 'indicator').

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" describes a specific method/scenario.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No explicit actions taken yet.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The phrase ""one day"" suggests less imminence for the general suicide thought, but the strong desire to ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" is a concrete, desired action that is only being stopped by a slim chance of college. This indicates a plan, even if not immediately actionable.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily future intentions (""one day,"" ""I want to run away... and die"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""im going to kill myself one day,"" ""might as well die""). Crucially, it also describes a specific method/scenario for ending life: ""run away to a forest and fucking die."" This moves it beyond general ideation into the realm of a specific plan or method, which is a characteristic of the 'Behavior' category. While the timing isn't ""tonight,"" the presence of a concrete method and the intense desire for it, with the only stopping factor being a slim chance of escape, aligns with the 'Behavior' definition of having a ""specific plan or method.""

I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" ""assisted suicide,"" and ""terminally suicidal."" It strongly implies a desire to die through phrases like ""Hoping to be murdered,"" ""I hate being alive,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me,"" ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered,"" ""to just end it all,"" and ""how much I want to die.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys extreme despair, hopelessness, and suffering (""I hate being alive,"" ""prolonging my suffering,"" ""losing more hope,"" ""useless I am and how alone I am,"" ""defective and unfit to be alive"").
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""hoping to be murdered"" and ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me"" or ""get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night."" However, these are *passive desires for an external event* to cause death, not a specific plan or method the individual intends to carry out themselves. The post explicitly states, ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself."" No preparations or actions taken by the individual are described.
*   **References to past attempts:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes. ""kill myself,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""terminally suicidal,"" ""I want to die,"" ""end it all,"" and repeated wishes to be murdered.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I hate being alive,"" ""I want to die,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me.""
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is very clear and direct.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? The post mentions ""murdered"" as a desired outcome, but this is a passive wish for an external act, not a method the individual plans to execute themselves. The individual explicitly states they lack the bravery to kill themselves.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No. Walking through sketchy areas is described as a passive hope for an external event, not a preparation for self-harm.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No imminent timing for self-initiated action is mentioned. The desire for murder is ongoing (""every night,"" ""every single day"").

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current and ongoing passive intentions (""every night,"" ""every single day"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses strong suicidal thoughts and a persistent desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" ""terminally suicidal""). This rules out 'Indicator'. While the post mentions a desired method of death (being murdered), it explicitly states the individual's *lack of ability or bravery to act on these thoughts themselves* (""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself""). The desire for murder is a passive wish for an external event, not a specific plan, preparation, or action initiated by the individual. There is no mention of a past attempt. Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts and feelings without specific plans or actions initiated by the individual.

    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""glad I'm going to die"" (paradoxical, but indicates acceptance/desire for death), ""felt unwanted,"" ""can't take no more,"" ""shithole"" (referring to life), ""joke."" High despair, hopelessness, sense of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: The phrase ""my favorite part is I'll experience it painfully"" suggests a desire for a specific *type* of death (painful) but does not name a concrete method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump"") nor describe preparations or actions taken.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes. Phrases like ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die,"" ""I think I'm going to leave,"" and ""See you all on the other side"" convey a strong sense of decision and imminent action, even without a specific method or timeline like ""tonight."" The counting of ""8,000 days"" and ""can't take no more"" reinforces a feeling of reaching an end point.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I'm going to die,"" ""I'm going to leave""). This rules out 'Indicator'. While no specific method is named, the language used (""I'm actually glad I'm going to die,"" ""I think I'm going to leave,"" ""See you all on the other side,"" ""I can't take no more"") conveys a high degree of intent and a sense of finality/imminence. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method."" This fits the post well, as the user expresses a clear decision to end their life, suggesting it is imminent, even without detailing the how. It goes beyond mere contemplation (Ideation) by expressing a definitive decision and readiness to act.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** ""I'm ready to die."" ""Hope it all ends soon."" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster."" ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I'm tired of it,"" ""I'm tired of working on healing,"" ""fucking joke.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" ""I'm quitting therapy."" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster,"" ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid"" all strongly imply a desire to die.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, indirectly but concretely: ""I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds."" This is a specific action to cease life-sustaining/improving treatment, explicitly linked to the desire to die. ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" also suggests a method of accelerating death through neglect.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I'm stopping all my meds today"" and ""I'm quitting therapy"" are concrete actions being initiated or planned for ""today"" with the stated purpose of facilitating death or ceasing efforts to live.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes, the actions (stopping meds, quitting therapy) are stated as happening ""today,"" indicating imminent intent to cease life-sustaining measures.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm ready to die,"" ""I'm stopping all my meds today,"" ""Hope it all ends soon"").
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The post goes beyond mere thoughts by detailing specific actions being taken or planned for ""today"" that are intended to facilitate death or cease life-preserving efforts (""I'm stopping all my meds today,"" ""I'm quitting therapy,"" ""Soda and junk will kill me faster""). This moves it beyond 'Ideation'.
    *   The actions described are preparations or actions taken with suicidal intent, and there is a strong sense of imminent timing (""today""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.
    *   There is no description of a past, initiated, or interrupted suicide attempt, which rules out 'Attempt'.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: ""I just want to disappear"" strongly implies a desire to cease to exist or be gone, which is a strong implication of wanting to end one's life. ""Free from all this pain"" reinforces this desire for an end to suffering.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""broken remainings of my soul,"" ""all this pain."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: None mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts**: None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""I just want to disappear"" is a strong implication of wanting to cease to exist, which is a form of wanting to die.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to disappear"" is an implied expression of wanting not to be alive.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The severe distress (""broken remainings of my soul,"" ""all this pain"") combined with the desire to ""disappear"" clearly implies suicidal intent, moving it beyond a general indicator.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current intentions (""I just want to disappear"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   The post expresses a strong desire to cease to exist (""I just want to disappear"") due to overwhelming pain, which constitutes a strongly implied suicidal thought or feeling.
*   However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or indications of imminent action.
*   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes strongly implied suicidal thoughts without specific plans or actions. It is beyond 'Indicator' due to the strong implication of wanting to end life, but does not reach 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' as there are no plans, actions, or past attempts described.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Key elements**: ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"", ""I just need a plan for suicide"".
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm**: Explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"".
    *   **Emotional indicators**: Strong implied distress and despair (rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I..."").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: The post explicitly states ""I just need a plan for suicide."" This indicates a clear intent to find or formulate a plan, which is a concrete step towards action, rather than just passive thoughts. It does not state a *specific* plan, but the active *need* for one.
    *   **References to past attempts**: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" are explicit.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" is a direct expression of considering ending one's life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Not specific actions like ""I got the pills,"" but the statement ""I just need a plan for suicide"" indicates an active mental state of seeking the means to act, which is a significant step beyond mere ideation. It implies readiness to act once a plan is identified.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The phrase ""I just need a plan"" implies that the *only thing missing* is the plan itself, suggesting a high level of readiness to proceed once a plan is formed. This active seeking of a plan indicates strong intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Why shouldn't I..."", ""I just need a plan"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   **Indicator**: This is clearly beyond 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation**: While it includes suicidal thoughts, the phrase ""I just need a plan for suicide"" goes beyond passive ideation. Ideation is defined as ""without specific plans or actions."" The *need for a plan* is an active step towards forming a plan or taking action. It's not just thinking about dying, but actively seeking the logistics to do so.
    *   **Behavior**: This category includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus (1) a specific plan/method, (2) preparations/actions taken, or (3) strong intent with imminent timing even without a method. The post demonstrates explicit suicidal thoughts and very strong intent. The active ""need for a plan"" signifies that the individual is actively engaged in the process of moving towards an attempt, even if a specific method hasn't been chosen or preparations haven't begun. This active seeking of a plan is a concrete step beyond mere contemplation and aligns with the heightened risk implied by the 'Behavior' category. It suggests the person is actively trying to bridge the gap between thought and action.
    *   **Attempt**: There is no description of a past or interrupted attempt.

Based on the explicit suicidal intent and the active pursuit of a plan (the ""need for a plan""), which indicates a step towards action rather than just passive thoughts, the post best fits the 'Behavior' category.

*   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses confusion and distress (""am I crazy or can anyone else relate?"").
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific *current* plan or method for a *future* attempt is mentioned. The ""finger gun"" is a symbolic action, not a preparation for an imminent attempt.
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** The post clearly states ""relating to my most recent failed attempt.""

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes. ""I'm going to kill myself"" is explicit.

*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No current preparations or actions for a *future* attempt. The ""finger gun"" is symbolic.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to both: current verbalizations/symbolic actions (""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""finger gun"") and a clear past event (""my most recent failed attempt"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? Yes. ""my most recent failed attempt.""

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly describes a ""most recent failed attempt."" According to the definitions, if a post describes a past suicide attempt, it falls under the 'Attempt' category. The rule also states: ""If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" This post clearly states a past attempt, overriding the current ideation and symbolic behaviors for classification.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'd rather kill myself now"") which rules out 'Indicator'. It goes beyond mere ideation because it includes a strong sense of urgency and desire for immediate relief (""now than endure another day""), which aligns with the 'Behavior' definition's criterion of ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method."" There are no descriptions of past attempts, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses fear (""I'm scared"") and internal conflict (""I don't want to leave my cats... but every single day I still have the urge"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method is mentioned: ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger."" However, the post immediately follows this with explicit statements of *inability to act*: ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already,"" and ""I can never bring myself to actually do it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No. Crucially, the post explicitly states the *inability* to take action despite the urge and thought of a method (""I can never bring myself to actually do it,"" ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already""). This indicates no concrete steps or preparations have been made, nor is there an imminent intent to execute the method.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? No, it states the opposite – an inability to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This is too strong for Indicator, as suicidal intent is explicit.
    *   **Ideation:** The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself"") and strong desires to end life, even mentioning a specific method (""blow my brains out""). However, it explicitly states ""without specific plans or actions"" and ""stops short of concrete steps"" by clearly indicating the user's *inability to act* on these urges or methods. The mention of a method is within the context of a recurring urge and thought, not a concrete plan or an imminent action.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan, preparations/actions taken, or strong imminent intent. While a method is mentioned, the explicit statements ""I can never bring myself to actually do it"" and ""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger already"" negate the presence of a concrete plan or imminent intent to execute. It describes a persistent ideation *with* a method in mind, but *without* the progression to a plan or action.
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempt is described.

Based on the explicit statements of inability to act despite the strong suicidal thoughts and mention of a method, the post falls under Ideation, as it stops short of concrete steps or a plan to execute.

*   **Emotional indicators**: ""i beg of you,"" ""horrible life"" convey extreme despair and desperation.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: A method (""murder me"") is mentioned, but it's a request for an *external* party to act, not a self-initiated plan or preparation by the poster to end their own life. The ""dm the address"" is a preparation to facilitate this external action.
*   **References to past attempts**: None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses a strong desire to die (""kill me,"" ""end my horrible life""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'. While a ""method"" (""murder me"") is mentioned, it is a desperate plea for *someone else* to perform the action, not a plan or action the individual is taking themselves. The definition of 'Behavior' specifically refers to the individual's own plan, preparations, or actions (e.g., ""I'll jump,"" ""I got the pills""). The post does not describe the individual's *own* self-harming plan or action. It is a severe form of suicidal thought and desire, seeking an external means to achieve death. Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation', which covers explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings without self-initiated plans or actions.

It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump""), or preparations (e.g., ""I wrote a note"") are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There is no mention of any past suicide attempts, incomplete or otherwise.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" is an explicit mention. ""I just want to collapse and let go"" is a strong implied expression of wanting to cease.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The strengthening of suicidal thoughts and the desire to ""collapse and let go"" directly express this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? While the thoughts are described as ""stronger and stronger,"" there is no specific timing like ""tonight"" or ""now"" that would indicate imminent action. The desire to ""collapse and let go"" is a feeling/wish, not a concrete plan for immediate action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes current feelings and strengthening current/future intentions (""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" ""i just want to collapse and let go"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and strong implied intent to cease, going beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post clearly includes ""explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings"" (""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" ""i just want to collapse and let go""). Crucially, it ""without specific plans or actions."" This aligns perfectly with the definition.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, or strong imminent intent with a concrete action implied. The desire to ""collapse and let go"" is a feeling, not a behavioral plan.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past suicide attempt is described.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: The post explicitly states ""I am planning to kill myself tonight"" and concludes with ""Rest In Peace ya'll,"" strongly implying the user's own death.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""I don't wish them any grief or guilt. This is my problem, my illness, it's on me. I expect nothing from no one."" This shows a sense of isolation, self-blame, and a desire to not burden others, often present in suicidal ideation.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: The phrase ""planning to kill myself tonight"" indicates a clear plan and imminent timing, even if a specific *method* isn't detailed. The context ""Everyone is asleep. Everyone who could help me is asleep now"" reinforces the timing and the perceived lack of immediate intervention.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing."" It also says, ""I don't belong here. I need to leave,"" which strongly implies a desire to end one's life. The phrase ""make myself suffer extraordinary pain"" suggests self-punishment, which can be a precursor to suicidal thoughts or actions.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""suffer extraordinary pain,"" ""decisions I've made in my past that have led me to where I am now,"" ""I don't belong here."" These indicate significant distress, guilt, hopelessness, and a desire to escape.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned. There is no indication of a specific way the person intends to end their life, nor any actions taken or preparations made.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The phrase ""I'm starting to think suicide is the only thing..."" indicates current contemplation and a strong desire, but it does not specify immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or a concrete step towards action. It's a thought process.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is too low. The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and a clear desire to ""leave,"" indicating more than just general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing"") and a strong desire to end life (""I don't belong here.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to ongoing actions (""I've been practicing,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing"") and strong future intentions (""can't wait for the day when I finally do it"").
*   Are past attempts described? No, ""practicing"" is preparation, not an initiated attempt to die that was stopped or failed.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes far beyond general distress (Indicator) and mere thoughts (Ideation). It includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""deserves to die,"" ""can't wait for the day when I finally do it"") *and* concrete preparations/actions taken (""I've been practicing hanging myself,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing"") towards a specific method (""hanging myself""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior', which includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus preparations or actions taken. It is not an 'Attempt' because the practicing is a rehearsal for a future act, not a past initiated action with intent to die that was incomplete or interrupted.

    *   **Indicator:** This category is too weak. The post contains explicit suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** While ""I want to die"" is ideation, the post goes beyond simple thoughts. The statement ""I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here"" indicates a critical state and a potential for imminent action, even without a specific method.

    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.'
        *   The post shows severe distress. The phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" implies a desire for things to end. However, the crucial part is the explicit denial: ""Im not suicidal or something."" This denial directly negates the interpretation of ""I just don't want to exist"" as suicidal intent. The user is distinguishing their feeling of profound weariness and wishing for their current state to cease from actual suicidal thoughts or plans.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly indicates severe emotional distress and a feeling of not wanting to exist. However, the user explicitly states, ""Im not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish."" This direct denial of suicidal intent is paramount. While ""I just don't want to exist"" could, in other contexts, imply ideation, the user's immediate clarification indicates that they are expressing a desire for their current suffering to end or for themselves to disappear, rather than a concrete intention to end their life through suicide. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' which describes general distress, sadness, or vague references to death ""without a clear desire to die,"" especially when suicidal intent is explicitly disavowed. The post describes significant risk factors and distress, but not direct suicidal intent.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No *current* specific plan or method for a *future* action is detailed. However, the post describes actions taken in a *past* attempt (""I read the draft [of the note],"" ""The moments leading up to my attempt"").
    *   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** Yes, the post explicitly states: ""I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note... (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed."" This is a clear description of a past, initiated, but failed attempt.

    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? No, the post is reflecting on a *past* attempt and current feelings *after* that attempt. While there is ongoing ideation, there is no *imminent* intent for a *new* action described.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to both. It describes a clear past attempt (""I attempted suicide last week"") and also expresses ongoing ideation (""I want to take my life"") and current feelings (""I am yet again back to square one"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? **Yes**. ""I attempted suicide last week... (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed."" This clearly describes an initiated but incomplete/failed action.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""I want to take my life"") and severe distress. However, the most defining element, according to the category definitions, is the clear description of a *past suicide attempt*: ""I attempted suicide last week... my attempt had failed."" The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" Since a past attempt is explicitly and clearly described, this is the most fitting category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Key elements**:
        *   ""How much valium does it take to kill you?"" - Implies seeking information for a lethal dose of a specific substance.
        *   ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough."" - This is the most critical element. It explicitly states that the user has already taken valium with the intent to die, and is now concerned it wasn't a sufficient amount to be fatal. This indicates an action has been initiated.
        *   ""I just want this nightmare to end."" - Expresses severe distress and a desire to escape, supporting the suicidal intent behind the action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""kill you"" is explicit. ""I just want this nightmare to end"" combined with the action taken strongly implies wanting to die.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""valium.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I haven't taken enough"" clearly indicates that valium *has been taken* with suicidal intent. This is an initiated action.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The action has already occurred.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" refers to a past action that has already occurred. The user is currently assessing the outcome of that past action.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? Yes, ""I haven't taken enough"" describes an incomplete or potentially failed attempt, where the action (taking valium) was initiated with suicidal intent.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post describes a concrete action (taking valium) that was initiated with suicidal intent (""to kill you,"" ""I just want this nightmare to end""). The phrasing ""I haven't taken enough"" indicates that this action was an attempt that the user believes was incomplete or insufficient to achieve death. This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent.""

I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""I don't want to live at all,"" and mentions ""suicide attempts"" multiple times. It details actions taken with suicidal intent (""swallowed every single one,"" ""sliced hard and fast across my neck,"" ""took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail""). The phrase ""it's like I just don't die"" implies a desire for death.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys a sense of despair and frustration with continued existence despite multiple brushes with death.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post describes past methods: ""30 unisom sleeping pills,"" ""straight razor,"" ""every prescription in the house, made a cocktail."" It also mentions a ""suicide note.""
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** The post explicitly details three distinct past suicide attempts:
    1.  Swallowing sleeping pills at age 16, accompanied by a suicide note.
    2.  Slicing across the neck with a straight razor in November 2020.
    3.  Taking a cocktail of prescription pills in November 2020.
    The post notes that these were survived or barely penetrated the skin, indicating incomplete or self-interrupted actions.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""suicide attempts,"" ""suicide note,"" ""I don't want to live at all.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I don't want to live at all,"" ""it's like I just don't die.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. Sleeping pills, straight razor, prescription cocktail.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes. Buying pills, writing a note, putting a new blade in a razor, slicing, taking prescriptions, making a cocktail. These are descriptions of past actions.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The opening ""I don't want to live at all"" suggests current ideation, but the detailed descriptions are of past events, not imminent actions.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The primary content details past events, specifically multiple past suicide attempts (""The first one came when I was 16,"" ""Next one was in November 2020""). There is also an expression of current ideation (""I don't want to live at all"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, multiple past attempts are clearly described, and the poster notes surviving them.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post clearly describes multiple past suicide attempts, including incomplete actions. The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent. If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" The post fulfills all these criteria.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: The post explicitly states, ""Tell my why I shouldn't kill myself,"" and ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it,"" and ""I just need someone to push me one more inch."" These are strong expressions of suicidal intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""All failing,"" ""feel my liver hurt,"" ""so stressed out,"" ""fucking everything up now,"" ""started crying."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: The post describes a specific method and action taken: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight.""
    *   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones**: The post clearly describes an initiated action with suicidal intent that was self-interrupted: ""Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This is a clear description of an incomplete suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""kill myself,"" ""I'm ready to be done.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' Not unclear; explicit.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight."" This describes an action initiated.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' Yes, ""tonight,"" and ""I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to a past event that occurred ""tonight"" (""I put a belt around my neck... tonight. Right before I passed out, I stopped..."") and also current/future intentions (""I'm so close to just doing it. Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch."").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? Yes, ""Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off, and started crying."" This is a clear description of an incomplete or self-interrupted attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post explicitly describes an action initiated with suicidal intent (""put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob"") which was then self-interrupted (""Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off""). This perfectly matches the definition of 'Attempt': ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent. If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" The past attempt is clear.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No. In fact, it explicitly states ""too scared to kill myself,"" indicating a *lack* of imminent intent or action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""too tired of life,"" ""kill myself""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
*   However, it explicitly states ""too scared to kill myself"" and does not mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent. This absence of concrete action or immediate intent, despite the presence of suicidal thoughts, aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.
*   It does not include a specific plan, preparations, or strong imminent intent, so it is not 'Behavior'.
*   It does not describe a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.

*   **Emotional indicators:** Anger, despair, hopelessness regarding life's purpose.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""taking a trip in April"" is stated as a specific action with a clear suicidal purpose (""to end this bullshit for good""). This indicates a plan and preparation.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings (Ideation) because it includes explicit suicidal intent (""to end this bullshit for good"") combined with a specific plan involving an action (""taking a trip"") and a timeline (""in April""). The statement ""This will be my second to last post"" further reinforces the concrete nature of the planned action. This fits the definition of 'Behavior', which includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan or preparations/actions taken. It does not describe a past attempt.

While it describes ""daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body"" and feeling ""unwanted,"" there is no direct or strongly implied statement of wanting to *end* one's life. The hypothetical ""I would fucking jump out of bed every morning"" is about being attractive, not a desire to jump to one's death.

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? No. The post expresses profound misery and a belief that life is inherently worse due to perceived unattractiveness, but it does not articulate a desire to die or end life.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The focus is on the *suffering of living* under specific conditions, not a desire to cease living.

It does not say ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to die soon,"" or similar phrases that would indicate ideation. The despair is focused on the *experience* of living as perceived, rather than a desire to end that existence. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator', which states: ""The post lacks explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent. It may show general distress, sadness, or vague references to death... without a clear desire to die. Severe hopelessness alone isn’t enough—suicidal intent must be explicit or strongly implied to move beyond this category.""

This describes a concrete action of self-harm, which is a method of suicide. While the poster states ""i dont think i want to die,"" the action itself is a highly dangerous, life-threatening act typically associated with suicidal intent.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""my stomach is hurting very badly,"" ""sweating badly and shaking too,"" ""i feel like a burden."" These indicate severe physical distress and emotional pain.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method has been used: ""took 44 paracetamol.""
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** This is a description of a *current* action that has been initiated, and the person is experiencing the immediate consequences. It fits the description of an initiated, potentially incomplete, attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied?** Strongly implied by the action of taking a large overdose of paracetamol, despite the stated ambivalence (""i dont think i want to die""). The act itself is a suicidal behavior.
*   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** The action of taking an overdose is a direct action towards ending life, even if the poster is now expressing ambivalence about the outcome. The question ""could i survive an od like this"" indicates a realization of the life-threatening nature of the action.
*   **If unclear, consider emotional context:** The severe physical distress, the initiated overdose, and the plea for help clearly indicate a crisis stemming from a life-threatening self-harm action.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   **Are specific methods mentioned?** Yes, ""44 paracetamol.""
*   **Are there signs of preparation or actions taken?** Yes, ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago."" This is an action that has been *taken*.
*   **Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method?** A method was used, and the action was taken.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** This refers to a very recent event (""almost an hour ago"") where an action was initiated, and the person is currently experiencing the consequences.
*   **Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones?** This describes an *initiated* action that is actively causing harm, fitting the definition of an ongoing or very recent attempt, potentially incomplete.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post describes a concrete action (""took 44 paracetamol"") that has been initiated with life-threatening consequences, leading to physical symptoms and a plea for help. This aligns directly with the 'Attempt' category definition: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions (e.g., 'I tried to hang myself but stopped'). A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent."" The act of taking a large overdose is a concrete action initiated with suicidal intent (even if the person is now ambivalent about the outcome).

The phrases ""I really can't handle it anymore"" and ""I'm exhausted"" indicate extreme distress and an inability to cope, but not a desire to die.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""sick and tired,"" ""vicious cycle of highs and lows,"" ""can't handle it anymore,"" ""feel like a robot,"" ""overloading,"" ""exhausted,"" ""completely hopeless,"" ""not fine."" These indicate severe emotional distress, despair, and hopelessness.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No. There are no direct statements of wanting to die or end life.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses severe distress, exhaustion, hopelessness, and an inability to cope with life's challenges. However, it *lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent*. There is no mention of wanting to die, wishing to be gone, or any form of suicidal ideation. The language indicates profound suffering and a desperate need for support, which aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' where severe hopelessness alone is not enough to move beyond this category if suicidal intent is not explicit or strongly implied.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post discusses past mental health struggles and current feelings of loneliness but emphasizes personal growth, therapy, and an overall improvement in well-being. There is no explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent. The mention of ""death"" is a general statement about hitting rock bottom, not a personal desire to die.

I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago).

Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it.

However, it *lacks* any explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to kill myself""). The mention of self-harm is presented as a way to ""cope,"" not as a means to end life.

*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: No specific method or preparation (e.g., ""pills,"" ""rope,"" ""note written"") is mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts**: There is no mention of a past suicide attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? **Yes**. The phrases ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" and ""it's finally ending"" are strong implications of ending one's life.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes**. ""22 years on this earth was enough for me"" directly implies a desire to not continue living.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is very clear and strong.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? **No**.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No**.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' **Yes**. ""Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all"" strongly suggests an imminent intent, indicating this is the final activity before the act. The phrase ""finally ending"" and the ""Goodbye"" also reinforce this sense of immediacy.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? **Current/future intentions with clear immediacy.** ""one last time before i end it all"" points to an action that is about to occur.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? **No**.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""end it all,"" ""call it quits""). It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'. It goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings (Ideation) because of the strong implication of imminent action and timing (""one last time before i end it all,"" ""finally ending,"" ""Goodbye""). While no specific method is stated, the imminent timing and clear intent (""strong intent with imminent timing... even without a method"") align perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""I will hang myself now,"" and ""that will kill me with it."" It also mentions, ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore,"" indicating a progression of distress.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses profound loneliness (""I don't want to be alone anymore,"" ""I've been alone since I was 5,"" ""I only sit in my room alone everyday""), despair (""it makes me sick""), and feelings of being unliked and used (""nobody has ever liked me and just made fun of me and used me"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states a specific method: ""hang myself."" It also describes an active preparation: ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it."" The user also mentions a detail about the method's perceived effectiveness based on weight: ""I don't think the thing will break off as I am only 44kg.""
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""Self-harm doesn't help me anymore,"" which indicates a history of self-harm, but not a past *suicide attempt*. The current intent is clearly suicidal.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""I will hang myself now,"" and ""that will kill me with it.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I will hang myself now,"" ""that will kill me with it,"" ""I don't want to be alone anymore.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hang myself.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie."" This indicates an active step towards carrying out the plan.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? Yes, ""I will hang myself now.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current and imminent intentions: ""I will hang myself now. I'm now looking for something...""
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No, past ""self-harm"" is mentioned, but not a past *suicide attempt*. The focus is on current, active suicidal intent and preparation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I will hang myself now"") and goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a method (""hang myself"") and describing active preparations (""I'm now looking for something that I can tie""). The timing is also imminent (""now""). This combination of explicit intent, specific plan/method, and actions/preparations fits the definition of 'Behavior'. It does not describe a *completed* or *interrupted* past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die.""

*   **Emotional indicators:** ""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" ""miserable,"" ""can barely function,"" ""ripped apart,"" ""can't stop shaking."" These indicate severe distress and hopelessness.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No. The post explicitly negates suicidal desire (""It's not even that I just want to die"").

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly conveys severe emotional distress, misery, and an inability to function or cope with life. However, it explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" which directly contradicts the criteria for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'. While the user is in extreme pain and struggling to live, there is no explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent. This fits the definition of 'Indicator', which describes general distress, sadness, or vague references to death without a clear desire to die, and where severe hopelessness alone isn’t enough to move beyond this category without suicidal intent.

Based on the analysis and the crucial rule ""The suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, not others mentioned,"" the post does not contain any indicators of suicidal intent from the author. The author is expressing concern for a friend and seeking help for the friend's situation. The 'Indicator' category is defined as a post that ""lacks explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent"" and may show general distress. While the post shows distress, it is distress *on behalf of someone else*, not personal suicidal distress. Therefore, this post fits the 'Indicator' category as the lowest level of risk, indicating the absence of suicidal intent from the person writing the post.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""last night I attempted once again""). The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions...

The post explicitly describes a past action that was an initiated but incomplete suicide attempt (""as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up,"" ""another failure""). It also describes a current action that is a repetition of this past attempt, where the user expects to survive but deep down hopes not to. According to the definitions, if a post describes a past suicide attempt, even if incomplete or self-interrupted, it should be classified as 'Attempt'. The current behavior is a continuation of this pattern of attempts.

*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No. The post explicitly states ""I never did it.""

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""I am going to shoot myself""). It goes beyond mere ideation by detailing a specific method (""loaded gun"") and describing significant preparatory actions (""loaded gun by my side,"" deleting accounts, emptying room). It also conveys a strong sense of imminent timing (""It's time,"" ""Too late to turn back now!""). Since there is no description of a completed past attempt, this falls under 'Behavior'.

I'm fine with either outcome.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""deeper than I've ever been,"" ""deepest depths of myself and darkest corners"" indicate severe distress and hopelessness.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific *suicide* plan or method is mentioned. The user talks about taking ""a few tabs of acid"" as a potential *alternative* or last resort to avoid suicide, not as a method of suicide itself.
*   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" is explicit. ""my end will only get nearer"" and ""I'm fine with either outcome"" strongly imply an acceptance of death.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the acceptance of ""my end will only get nearer"" if the acid doesn't help implies a desire to die.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *suicide* methods are mentioned. The acid is presented as a coping mechanism or an alternative to suicide, not a means to commit it.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No preparations or actions *for suicide* are mentioned.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? ""my end will only get nearer"" suggests a future intention, but it lacks the immediate, concrete timing (e.g., ""tonight"") to qualify for 'Behavior' without a specific method or action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" refers to ongoing current thoughts. ""I'd rather take a few tabs of acid... if it doesn't... my end will only get nearer"" refers to future intentions contingent on the outcome of taking acid.
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly articulates persistent suicidal thoughts (""thinking of suicide for months on end"") and an acceptance of death as a potential outcome (""my end will only get nearer. I'm fine with either outcome""). However, it does not describe a specific plan or method for suicide, nor does it detail any actions taken towards suicide. The mention of acid is as a potential way to *avoid* suicide, not to commit it. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation', which includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""hit a new low,"" ""haven't felt ok in a while,"" ""not sure what to do."" These indicate significant emotional pain, hopelessness, and distress.

    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The intent stated is ""just to feel ok for one night.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' In this case, there is severe distress, but the intent is clearly for temporary relief, not death.

**3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' The actions occurred ""tonight,"" but the *intent* of these actions, as stated, is not suicidal. The actions are presented as a coping mechanism for distress, not as a means to end life.

**4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current actions (""tonight i stole,"" ""ive had a bit to drink tonight"").

**5. CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post clearly indicates severe distress and maladaptive coping mechanisms (substance use). However, it lacks any explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent. The stated purpose of taking the medication and drinking is ""just to feel ok for one night,"" which points to a desire for temporary relief from pain, not a desire to end life. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Indicator'. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (no suicidal thoughts/feelings), 'Behavior' (actions not coupled with suicidal intent), or 'Attempt' (no past attempt described).

136,"I wanna move anymore. hey. You don't know me but I figured I could let things out here, my family just had a huge fight over all of our problems and stuff. I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for. Hold on to them. Because life is temporary. And from what I've learned, not everybody gets the happy ending",3,attempt,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes. The post explicitly states, ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now,"" ""i had an attempt when I was 14,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" and ""this world's just not meant for me.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Yes. The post conveys severe distress, loneliness, hopelessness, and pain (""huge fight,"" ""pain,"" ""impossible situation,"" ""lonely kid in his dark room,"" ""Life's a bitch,"" ""pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me,"" ""Im stuck. In alone."").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific current plans or methods are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** Yes. The post clearly states, ""i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""I've been suicidal,"" ""i had an attempt,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" ""this world's just not meant for me.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No, not for current intent.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The phrasing ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"" suggests current ideation, but no specific imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. The post explicitly details past suicide attempts (""i had an attempt when I was 14,"" ""a few close calls""). It also expresses current feelings of hopelessness and a desire not to go on (""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes. ""i had an attempt when I was 14"" and ""a few close calls but never succeed.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    Based on the analysis, the post clearly describes a past suicide attempt and ""close calls"" (incomplete actions). The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" Since a past attempt is explicitly and clearly described, this category is the most appropriate, overriding current ideation alone.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   The post states, ""I am 29 still live with my parents."" This indicates a potential source of frustration or dissatisfaction.
    *   The string ""4kdjejdne sjdjd fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo"" contains an expletive (""fuckkkkkkkk"") followed by a long string of random characters. The expletive indicates strong negative emotion (frustration, anger, despair), but the random characters do not convey any specific meaning related to suicide.
    *   There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or implications of wanting to end one’s life.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, or preparations.
    *   There are no references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: The post shows severe distress or frustration, but there is no implied intent to end life. It's an outburst of negative emotion without suicidal ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current situation and an immediate emotional outburst. There is no suicidal content to assess temporal context for.
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses general distress and strong negative emotion (""fuckkkkkkkk"") related to a personal situation (""I am 29 still live with my parents"").
    *   However, it lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent, desire to die, plans, actions, or past attempts.
    *   Based on the definitions:
        *   'Ideation' requires explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts. Not present.
        *   'Behavior' requires a plan, preparations, or imminent intent. Not present.
        *   'Attempt' requires description of a past attempt. Not present.
        *   'Indicator' fits best as it describes a post showing general distress without clear suicidal intent. The severe negative emotion is present, but it does not cross the threshold into suicidal ideation.

*   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, hopelessness, resolve to die.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""figured out how to properly hang myself"" indicates a specific method and knowledge/preparation. ""start cutting again"" refers to a method of self-harm.
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** ""I've done it many times"" in the context of ""killing myself"" is a direct and clear reference to past suicide attempts. ""start cutting again"" implies past self-harm, often linked to attempts.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? Not explicitly imminent (e.g., ""tonight""), but ""One of these days I'll finally do it"" and ""I'll break killing myself regardless"" show strong future intent, with ""interference"" being the only current barrier.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Both. ""I've done it many times"" refers to past events. ""One of these days I'll finally do it"" and ""I'll break killing myself regardless"" refer to future intentions.

I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang.

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but strong implication of not wanting to live (""Why should I still live"").
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Why should I still live.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The context is severe distress with clear implied intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The specific methods mentioned refer to past events (""I tried...""). The general sentiment of not wanting to live is current.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes far beyond general distress (Indicator) or mere thoughts of suicide (Ideation) because it explicitly details concrete actions taken with suicidal intent.
    *   While it mentions specific methods and actions, these are described as *past attempts* that were incomplete or self-interrupted. The definition of 'Attempt' specifically covers ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions (e.g., 'I tried to hang myself but stopped').

*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes. The current weight (90 pounds) and the stated ""new goal weight"" (78 pounds) indicate an ongoing process and a concrete plan for self-harm leading to death.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The intent is to ""slowly kill myself,"" indicating a definite plan, albeit prolonged. The specificity of the weight goal makes it a concrete plan.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions and an ongoing process (""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""my new goal weight is 78 pounds,"" ""I think if I slowly kill myself this way"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""slowly kill myself,"" ""finally kill me"") combined with a specific plan and method (starvation to a defined goal weight of 78 pounds or lower). This goes beyond mere thoughts (Ideation) and describes a concrete course of action aimed at ending life, which fits the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not an 'Attempt' as it describes a future/ongoing plan, not a completed or interrupted past action. It is far too specific and intentional to be an 'Indicator'.

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm:** The word ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned. The post is inquiring about a method to commit suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** No direct emotional indicators are present.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent"") is identified and inquired about. No preparations or actions are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No references to past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned? Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The question ""Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?"" strongly implies a consideration of suicide, indicating suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""charcoal bbq in a tent"" is a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No. The post is a question, not a description of an action or preparation.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No imminent timing is mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current consideration or future possibility, not a past event.
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**

*   **Indicator:** This category is too low. The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and a specific method, indicating more than general distress.
*   **Ideation:** The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (by asking about suicide) and inquires about a specific method. While a specific method is mentioned, the post is a *question* about its possibility, not a *statement of a plan* or an *action taken*. According to the definition, Ideation is ""without specific plans or actions."" An inquiry about a method, while serious, does not constitute a ""specific plan"" as exemplified by ""I'll jump off a bridge,"" which implies intent to carry out the plan.
*   **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan *stated as intent*, preparations, actions taken, or imminent timing. The post is an inquiry about a method's possibility, not a declaration of intent to use it, nor does it describe preparations or imminent timing.
*   **Attempt:** This category describes a past suicide attempt. This post is not about a past attempt.

Based on the definitions, particularly the distinction between ""inquiring about a specific method"" and ""having a specific plan or method"" (which implies intent or commitment), the post best fits 'Ideation'. It's a strong form of ideation, as it involves researching means, but it doesn't cross the threshold into a stated plan or action.

I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post states, ""everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault."" It also says, ""Life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it."" Crucially, it then states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me..."" This indicates a passive desire for non-existence for the benefit of others, despite explicitly negating active intent to commit suicide.
*   **Emotional indicators:** Severe hopelessness (""it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life,"" ""I don't think I'll escape it,"" ""I don't think I'll ever be good enough""), despair, shame (""I feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything""), and intense self-loathing (""self loathing,"" ""hate everything about how I look"").

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""want to die"" is explicit. The phrase ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" explicitly negates active intent, but the subsequent ""I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me"" implies a passive suicidal thought (wishing to be gone for others' sake).

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""want to die"") and strong passive suicidal thoughts (""I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me""). However, it explicitly states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die,"" which rules out active intent for Behavior or a stronger form of Ideation. This fits the definition of Ideation, specifically the range from ""passive thoughts (e.g., 'I wish I weren’t here')"" to ""stronger desires to end life, but stops short of concrete steps."" It's more than just an Indicator because of the explicit ""want to die"" and the clear passive suicidal ideation. It does not include plans, preparations, imminent timing (Behavior), or a past attempt (Attempt).

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post uses the metaphor of a ""sick dog"" that ""eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down"" and ""It sounds weird hearing the 'dog' put itself down."" This is a strong, clear implication of wanting to end one's life. The phrase ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around"" suggests a deadline, after which this implied action might occur. ""But I can't do it anymore"" also indicates a breaking point.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses extreme fatigue (""Im tired""), hopelessness (""I can't find a way to fix them. Fix myself. anything.""), despair (""Nothing's real to me anymore.""), self-loathing (""I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me.""), and a sense of being trapped.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, gathering items) are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, strongly implied through the ""put down"" metaphor, directly linking the self to an animal that needs to be euthanized.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the ""put down"" metaphor is a direct implied expression of wanting to die.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The emotional context is severe, and the implied intent is clear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? The post states ""I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around,"" which is a future conditional timeframe, not an imminent intent like ""tonight"" or ""now.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to current feelings and a future conditional intention (""3 weeks to turn around,"" ""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is too low. The post contains strongly implied suicidal intent (the ""put down"" metaphor).
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post includes strongly implied suicidal thoughts and feelings (""Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down,"" ""It sounds weird hearing the 'dog' put itself down"") without specific plans or actions. The ""3 weeks"" is a temporal limit for the situation to improve, after which the implied ideation would come into play, but it's not a plan or an imminent action.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan/method, preparations, or strong intent with *imminent* timing. None of these are present. There is no method mentioned, no preparations, and the ""3 weeks"" timeframe is not considered ""imminent"" in the context of the 'Behavior' definition (e.g., ""tonight"").
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempt is described.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and feelings through a strong metaphor, but lacks a specific plan, actions taken, or imminent intent.

Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Indirectly, by ruling out household weapons.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes. ""Plotting"" for months indicates planning. ""Yesterday, I drafted my will"" is a concrete preparation or action taken.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, the post explicitly states, ""Today, I feel better. I am out of my hole for now. I don't think I would do 'it'.""

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past plotting (""on and off for months"") and a past preparation (""Yesterday, I drafted my will""). The current state is one of reduced intent (""I don't think I would do 'it'"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to explicit mentions of suicide, plotting, and specific preparations. It also goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) because it describes concrete actions taken in preparation (""drafted my will"") and ongoing planning (""plotting""). It does not describe a past *attempt* where a suicidal action was initiated. Therefore, the presence of explicit suicidal thoughts combined with planning (""plotting"") and concrete preparations (""drafted my will"") fits the definition of 'Behavior'. While the current intent is mitigated, the past actions and ongoing planning are key.

CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Identify mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post expresses extreme exhaustion (""I’m so tired,"" ""I have no more energy to deal with this anymore""), profound despair (""the world is just fucked in every single way. EVERYTHING IS FUCKED""), and anger/hatred towards another person (""FUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCFFFKKKKKKKK YOUUUUU,"" ""I fucking hate you""). There's a complex phrase: ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally."" This appears to be directed at someone else, wishing for their absence or demise to bring peace to the writer and others, rather than expressing the writer's own suicidal intent.
*   **Note emotional indicators:** Rage, anger, despair, exhaustion, hopelessness, feeling abandoned, hatred, feeling ""sick"" due to another's actions.
*   **Look for specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **Check for references to past attempts:** None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")?** No explicit mention of suicide or self-harm. There are no strong implications of wanting to end *their own* life. The exhaustion and despair are profound, but framed as an inability to *deal with the situation/person* (""no more energy to deal with this anymore""), not a desire to die. The phrase ""give us all some peace finally"" is directed at someone else's actions/existence, not the writer's own. (No)
*   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions. The implied expressions are of extreme distress and exhaustion from a situation, not a direct desire for self-termination. (No)
*   **If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.'** While there is severe distress, the implied *suicidal intent* is not present. The post focuses on anger, exhaustion, and despair related to external factors and another person, without a clear desire to end one's own life.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current distress and anger. No past attempts are described.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post exhibits severe emotional distress, anger, exhaustion, and existential despair. However, it *lacks explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent* regarding the writer's own life. The ""peace finally"" comment is directed externally. The core message is one of extreme emotional pain and an inability to cope with a situation and another person, fitting the definition of general distress without a clear desire to die. Therefore, it falls into the 'Indicator' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""I don't want to kill myself, but."" This directly introduces the concept of suicide, even if immediately negated. The ""but"" clause then details profound despair, hopelessness (""nothing going for me,"" ""nothing is going to change,"" ""so stagnant for so long""), and a feeling of being trapped (""walls are closing in and there's no escape""). While the user states they don't hate life, they are ""sick of *this* life"" and feel utterly stuck with no foreseeable improvement.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Severe hopelessness, despair, stagnation, feeling trapped, loneliness (pushed friends away), lack of purpose, feeling rejected.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied?** Yes, ""I don't want to kill myself"" explicitly mentions suicide. While it's a negation, the presence of the word itself and the subsequent ""but"" followed by profound despair and a feeling of ""no escape"" strongly imply that suicidal thoughts are present or being struggled with, even if passively or resisted.
    *   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions of wanting to die. However, the feeling of ""nothing is going to change"" and ""the walls are closing in and there's no escape"" can be interpreted as a passive desire for the current suffering to end, which aligns with passive ideation.
    *   **If unclear, consider emotional context:** The severe distress, hopelessness, and feeling of being trapped (""no escape"") are significant. The explicit mention of ""kill myself"" (even negated) combined with this deep despair leans towards 'ideation' rather than just 'indicator'.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation or actions taken?** No.
    *   **Does the post suggest imminent intent?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current feelings and a bleak future outlook (""nothing is going to change"").
    *   **Are past attempts described?** No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**

*   **Indicator:** This category is for general distress without explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent. The post goes beyond this due to the explicit mention of ""kill myself"" (even if negated) and the profound, pervasive sense of hopelessness and being trapped (""no escape""), which implies a struggle with suicidal thoughts or feelings.
*   **Ideation:** This category includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions. The phrase ""I don't want to kill myself, but..."" directly addresses the concept of suicide. The subsequent description of extreme despair, stagnation, and the feeling of ""no escape"" suggests that suicidal thoughts are present, even if resisted or passive. The feeling of being trapped with no way out is a strong indicator of ideation.
*   **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan, method, preparations, or imminent intent. None are present.
*   **Attempt:** This category requires a description of a past suicide attempt. None is present.

Based on the explicit mention of ""kill myself"" (even if negated) and the overwhelming feelings of hopelessness and being trapped with ""no escape,"" the post indicates the presence of suicidal thoughts or feelings, even if passive or resisted.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** Yes, ""overwhelming and difficult,"" ""in a rut,"" ""too weak and pathetic.""
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, ""I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family"" (specific timing and circumstance), ""I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" (suggests preparatory actions like saying goodbyes).
*   **References to past attempts:** No.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, jump).
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" can be interpreted as preparatory actions (e.g., saying goodbyes).
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes, ""tomorrow"" indicates imminent timing.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself""). It also includes imminent timing (""tomorrow"") and describes actions that could be considered preparatory (""hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out""). While there's no specific *method* mentioned, the combination of explicit intent, imminent timing, and implied preparatory actions moves it beyond simple ideation. It fits the 'Behavior' definition: ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts plus either: (1) a specific plan or method, (2) preparations or actions taken, or (3) strong intent with imminent timing even without a method."" This post satisfies points (2) and (3). The ambivalence (""I just am too weak and pathetic to do it"") does not negate the strong and imminent intent expressed.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrase ""I'm still dead inside"" indicates severe emotional numbness. The most critical phrase is ""I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much."" ""Yeet myself"" is a colloquialism that, in this context of severe depression and hopelessness, strongly implies a desire for self-harm or suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""huge depressive episode,"" ""still sad,"" ""still anhedonic,"" ""dead inside,"" ""beyond saving."" These clearly indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being beyond help.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump"") or preparations (e.g., ""I wrote a note"") are mentioned. ""Yeet myself"" is a general expression of desire, not a specific plan.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""yeet myself way too much"" is a strong, albeit colloquial, implication of suicidal intent or self-harm desire.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the desire to ""yeet myself"" combined with the profound despair (""dead inside,"" ""beyond saving"") implies a desire to escape or end the current state, which leans towards wanting to die or not be alive.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The distress is severe, and the implied intent is present.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No. ""Yeet myself"" is not a specific method.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No specific timing is mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to current feelings and a present desire (""I just want to cry and yeet myself"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This post goes beyond general distress. The phrase ""yeet myself"" strongly implies suicidal intent, moving it beyond the 'Indicator' category.
    *   **Ideation:** The post includes a strongly implied suicidal thought/feeling (""I just want to... yeet myself"") without specific plans, methods, or preparations. It expresses a desire to end life or self-harm but lacks the concrete steps or imminent timing required for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan/method, preparations, or strong intent with imminent timing. None of these are present. ""Yeet myself"" is a general expression of desire, not a specific plan.
    *   **Attempt:** This category requires a description of a past suicide attempt. No past attempt is described.

Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts/feelings (""yeet myself"") without detailing a specific plan, method, or action taken.

    *   **References to past attempts**: Yes, ""I tried to end it once before"" is a clear reference to a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: The emotional context is severe distress, but the explicit mention of a past attempt is the primary factor.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No, not for current intent.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, not for current intent. The ""wish I succeeded"" refers to a past event.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""I tried to end it once before"") and a current feeling/wish related to that past event (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, ""I tried to end it once before"" clearly describes a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post explicitly describes a ""past suicide attempt"" (""I tried to end it once before"").
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent. If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear.""
    *   This post perfectly fits the 'Attempt' definition due to the clear mention of a past attempt. While there is also current ideation (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded""), the primary classifying factor is the past attempt.

*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: None are mentioned.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The phrasing ""I just wanna kill myself out of fear"" expresses a strong desire driven by current distress, but it doesn't include a specific timeline (like ""tonight"") or a concrete decision to act that would push it into 'behavior'. It's a strong thought/feeling.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention/desire.
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly states ""I just wanna kill myself,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings. However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, actions taken, or description of a past attempt. While the distress is high, the lack of a concrete plan or action keeps it from 'behavior', and it's not a past 'attempt'. It clearly goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to the explicit suicidal statement. Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

However, it lacks any mention of specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing that would qualify it as 'Behavior'. It is clearly beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicidal intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""attempting suicide"" multiple times (""going through with attempting suicide,"" ""I was so close to attempting suicide"").
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""regretting it immensely,"" ""mortifying and embarrassing,"" ""want to rip my hair out,"" ""dreading this,"" ""cannot stand living with my family,"" ""nauseous."" These indicate severe distress and discomfort.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan or method is mentioned for a *current* intent. The post describes a past situation where the individual was ""so close"" to an attempt.
    *   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** The post states, ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text."" This describes a past moment of extremely high suicidal intent that was *interrupted* or *averted* by seeking help, rather than initiating a physical action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""attempting suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"" directly implies a strong desire to die that was being considered as an option.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No specific physical actions or preparations are described as having been initiated. The action taken was *telling the mother* as an alternative to the attempt.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? It describes a *past* moment of ""strong intent with imminent timing"" (""I was so close to attempting suicide""). The current situation is the consequence of *averting* that past imminent intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The core suicidal element (""I was so close to attempting suicide"") refers to a *past* event or state of mind. The current situation (moving back home) is a consequence of averting that past intent.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? The phrase ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" describes being at the very brink of initiating an attempt, which was then *self-interrupted* or *averted* by reaching out. While no concrete physical action was explicitly stated as having begun and stopped, the level of intent described is beyond mere ideation and signifies being on the verge of action. However, the definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action...initiated."" The post describes being *close* to initiating, not having initiated and stopped.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. Explicit suicidal intent is present.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect. The post goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings. ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" describes a past state of being at the brink of action, which is more intense than typical ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** This category includes ""strong intent with imminent timing."" The post describes a *past instance* of this (""I was so close to attempting suicide""). Even though it was averted, the post is recounting a situation where the individual was at the 'Behavior' level of risk. This fits better than 'Attempt' because no concrete physical action was explicitly stated as having been initiated.
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect. While the intent was extremely high and averted, the post does not explicitly state that a ""concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent"" and then stopped. It states the individual was ""so close"" to initiating one.

The post describes a past situation that met the criteria for 'Behavior' (strong, imminent intent), which was then averted.

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""I wont kill myself of course,"" which is a direct denial of suicidal intent. While it expresses extreme pain (""I cant take it,"" ""excruciating""), this pain is linked to a desire to ""scream and break everything,"" not to end life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I cant take it,"" ""pain,"" ""scream,"" ""break everything,"" ""excruciating."" These indicate severe distress, frustration, and emotional overwhelm.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The desire is to express pain outwardly (scream, break things), not to self-harm or end life.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No. Suicide is explicitly *denied* (""I wont kill myself of course"").
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The distress is about the pain itself, not a desire for death.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: The emotional context is severe distress, but the explicit denial of suicidal intent is paramount.

    *   Crucially, it explicitly *denies* suicidal intent (""I wont kill myself of course"").
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts mentioned.
    *   This fits the definition of 'Indicator' which describes general distress, sadness, or vague references to death without a clear desire to die, and where severe hopelessness alone isn't enough if suicidal intent isn't explicit or strongly implied. In this case, intent is explicitly denied.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post focuses on gender dysphoria and a desire for gender affirmation.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post expresses significant distress related to gender dysphoria and a desire for gender affirmation. However, it completely lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent, thoughts of dying, or references to self-harm. While the individual is clearly struggling, the content does not meet the criteria for ideation, behavior, or attempt. It aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which describes general distress without clear suicidal intent.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrase ""I wish I had the courage to end it all"" is a strong implication of wanting to end one's life. ""how much I loathe my existence"" also points to a desire not to be alive.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""absolutely hate myself,"" ""loathe my existence,"" ""in so much pain,"" ""Today was another day. A bad one."" These indicate severe self-hatred, despair, and distress.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** None are mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""I wish I had the courage to end it all"" is a strong implication.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wish I had the courage to end it all"" and ""how much I loathe my existence.""
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The emotional context is severe distress and self-hatred, supporting ideation.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No. The post explicitly states, ""I just want the courage to endure it all"" and encourages others to ""Stay around to see these days,"" indicating a lack of imminent intent and a desire to persist.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to current thoughts and desires (""I wish I had the courage to end it all"") but also a current desire to endure.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains a clear, strongly implied expression of suicidal thoughts (""I wish I had the courage to end it all,"" ""I loathe my existence""). However, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent. In fact, the post pivots to a message of endurance and support for others, stating ""I just want the courage to endure it all"" and encouraging ""Stay around to see these days."" This fits the definition of 'Ideation', which includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions, ranging from passive thoughts to stronger desires to end life, but stopping short of concrete steps. It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (no plan/action/imminent intent) or 'Attempt' (no past action). It goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicidal implication.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""if my friends didn't exist i probably wouldn't be alive right now,"" which strongly implies suicidal dependency. Crucially, it says, ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide."" It also adds, ""yet i still consider,"" indicating ongoing suicidal ideation.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""my anxiety has gotten much more severe,"" ""really sick of my family,"" ""no friends at school"" indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and loneliness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post states, ""but i didn't have anything to do it with,"" indicating a *lack* of means prevented a past action. No current specific plan or method is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" directly describes a past event where the individual was on the verge of acting with suicidal intent, but was prevented by external circumstances (lack of means). This fits the definition of an incomplete or thwarted attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""almost committed suicide"" is explicit. ""wouldn't be alive right now"" and ""still consider"" are strong implications.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""if my friends didn't exist i probably wouldn't be alive right now.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, the post explicitly states a *lack* of means (""didn't have anything to do it with"").
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? The phrase ""almost committed suicide"" indicates that the intent to act was present and the individual was on the verge of initiating the action, only prevented by a practical barrier. This is a significant step beyond mere ideation.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? ""yet i still consider"" indicates ongoing ideation, but not necessarily immediate, imminent intent with a specific plan for *now*. The event of ""almost committed suicide"" happened ""a few days ago.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past event (""a few days ago i almost committed suicide"") and current/ongoing ideation (""yet i still consider"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes. ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" clearly describes a past, incomplete attempt where the action was intended but thwarted by circumstances.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** While ""yet i still consider"" is ideation, the core of the post describes a past event that goes beyond just thinking.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect. This category requires a *current* specific plan, preparations, or imminent intent. The post describes a *past* event of being on the verge of suicide, not a current plan or action.
    *   **Attempt:** This category is defined as describing ""a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions."" The phrase ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide but i didn't have anything to do it with"" perfectly fits this definition. The individual had the intent to act, and was only prevented by the lack of means, which constitutes an incomplete or thwarted attempt.

165,suicide with me. can anyone suicide with me together. for those want to suicide too,1,ideation,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Key elements**: The post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" multiple times and asks if anyone wants to ""suicide with me together,"" addressing ""those want to suicide too."" This indicates a strong desire to end one's life and a search for others with similar intent.
*   **Emotional indicators**: While not explicitly stated, the repeated plea implies severe distress and a desire for death.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, gathering tools) are mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts**: No mention of past attempts.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes**, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned multiple times.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes**, the phrase ""suicide with me"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? **No**.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No**.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The post expresses a current desire (""can anyone suicide with me together""), but it lacks the explicit imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete steps that would push it into 'Behavior'. It's a general call for shared suicidal intent, not a declaration of an immediate, planned action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? **Current/future intentions** (""can anyone suicide with me together"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? **No**.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly states a desire to ""suicide"" and seeks others who ""want to suicide too."" This clearly indicates suicidal thoughts and intent. However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or descriptions of actions taken. It also does not describe a past attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions.""

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. The ""practice hung"" is a past (very recent) event. The desire to ""try again"" and ""can't wait any longer"" refers to current/future intentions.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, the action of ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped"" directly fits the definition of an incomplete or self-interrupted attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains strong elements that could fit 'Behavior' due to explicit suicidal ideation, a specific method, and imminent intent. However, the critical piece of information is the description of an initiated action with suicidal intent that was interrupted: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself but stopped""). A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent. If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" The user initiated a concrete action towards hanging themselves, even if they stopped.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: The post states, ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun."" This indicates a specific method is being considered, even if not fully decided or acted upon yet. The phrases ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" and ""It's finally fucking time"" suggest a strong, imminent intent to act.
    *   **References to past attempts**: The post mentions ""my suicidal ideation"" in the past, but it does not describe a past *attempt* (an initiated action).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. (""violently suicidal,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I just want to fucking die"").

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""get a gun"" is mentioned as a method the user has ""always thought"" about.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No specific preparations or actions are described as having been taken (e.g., buying the gun). However, the language ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" and ""It's finally fucking time"" strongly suggests imminent intent to act.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes, the phrases ""I'm finally doing it"" and ""It's finally fucking time"" clearly convey imminent intent. The mention of a specific method (""get a gun"") further solidifies this.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current and future intentions (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I'm finally ready to do it,"" ""I just want to fucking die""). Past ""suicidal ideation"" is mentioned, but the core of the post is about present intent.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent and strong imminent intent.
    *   **Ideation**: Ruled out because the post goes beyond mere thoughts. It expresses strong, imminent intent to act (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""It's finally fucking time"") and considers a specific method (""get a gun"").
    *   **Behavior**: This category fits best. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I just want to fucking die"") combined with strong intent and imminent timing (""I'm finally doing it,"" ""It's finally fucking time,"" ""I think I know that I'm going to go through with it""). Additionally, a specific method (""get a gun"") is being considered, which further supports this classification. The statement ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun"" indicates a method is in mind, even if the precise execution is not yet clear. The overwhelming sense is that the decision to act has been made, and the method is being considered.
    *   **Attempt**: Ruled out as no past suicide attempt is described.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: The phrase ""full intentions to end things"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent. ""Doesn't want me dead"" also touches on themes of death. ""Sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb"" indicates a desire for escape from pain, potentially implying a wish to not exist in their current state.
*   **Emotional indicators**: Feelings of being unvalued (""apathetic about my existing""), impulsivity, and a desire for numbness point to significant distress and despair. The question ""Is that pathetic?"" indicates self-doubt or shame.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: ""just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" describes a concrete action (driving to a specific location) taken with suicidal intent. While a specific *method* isn't detailed, the *preparation* and *action* of going to a chosen location for this purpose is present.
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones**: ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it."" This describes an action initiated with suicidal intent (driving to the location for that purpose) that was then self-interrupted or not completed.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., jumping, pills) is mentioned, but a specific *location* chosen for the purpose of ending things is described, which serves as a preparation/action.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" is a clear sign of an action taken towards suicide.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The intent was imminent (""just finished driving up... with full intentions""), but the user then states ""I don't think I'm going to do it,"" indicating an interrupted action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a very recent past event (""I just finished driving up..."") where an action was initiated with suicidal intent.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, the description ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not explicitly.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""its working!"" strongly suggests that an action or preparation has been initiated and is currently in progress. This moves beyond mere thought.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes, ""its working!"" combined with the desire to ""never wake up"" implies immediate and ongoing action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/ongoing action and imminent future outcome (""never wake up"").
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""hopefully this is my last post,"" ""pls let me never wake up""). This rules out 'Indicator'.
    *   The phrase ""its working!"" indicates that an action or preparation is underway, or a process has been initiated. This goes beyond mere thoughts or desires, which defines 'Ideation'.
    *   'Attempt' refers to a *past* action, including incomplete or self-interrupted ones. While ""its working!"" could precede an attempt, the phrasing suggests an *ongoing* process or a preparation that has just begun, rather than a past, completed, or interrupted action. The post describes an action in progress with imminent intent.
    *   'Behavior' includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus either a specific plan, preparations or actions taken, or strong intent with imminent timing. ""its working!"" fits the ""preparations or actions taken"" criterion, indicating a step beyond ideation towards an action.

- Mentions ""42 unnamed pills"" and ""allergy medicine"" as means, indicating possession of potential methods.
- States ""this time i actually have the means to,"" confirming availability of method.
- Expresses clear intent: ""tonight im gonna do it,"" ""im so ready to die.""
- Acknowledges past ideation without follow-through (""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"") but emphasizes current readiness and means.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Yes, specific methods are mentioned: ""42 unnamed pills,"" ""old antidepressants,"" and ""allergy medicine.""
- Yes, signs of preparation/actions taken: The user *has* the pills (""i have 42 unnamed pills,"" ""i also have some allergy medicine"").
- Yes, the post suggests imminent intent: ""tonight im gonna do it.""

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Refers to past *statements* about doing it but current/future *intentions* and *means* (""tonight im gonna do it"").
- No, past attempts are not described; rather, it states past *threats* were not acted upon (""but then i never do"").

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post goes beyond mere ideation by clearly stating possession of a specific means (pills) and expressing imminent intent to act (""tonight im gonna do it""). It does not describe a past completed or interrupted action, so it's not an 'attempt'. It clearly indicates more than just thoughts or vague distress, fitting the 'behavior' definition of having a specific plan/method and imminent timing.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: The phrases ""I really want to check out,"" ""how much I want to check out,"" and ""moral problem with suicide"" explicitly indicate suicidal intent and a desire to end one's life. ""Unexpectedly checking out"" and ""go out this way"" further reinforce this.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""running on nothing but shear spite,"" ""can not really express how much I want to check out,"" and ""even spite has its limits"" convey extreme emotional exhaustion, despair, and a struggle to continue living.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
*   The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""it would just be a lot easier""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
*   It explicitly asks for a method, which is a strong form of suicidal ideation. However, it does not state a *specific plan* or *method* that the user has identified or intends to use, nor does it mention any *preparations or actions taken*. The definition of 'Behavior' requires a specific plan/method, preparations, or imminent timing with strong intent. While the intent is strong, the *lack of a stated specific plan or action* keeps it from being 'Behavior'. Asking for a plan is still within the realm of ideation.
*   There is no description of a past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.

Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it.

However, these are presented as warnings and informational content directed at others, not as expressions of the poster's own intent. The phrases ""Don't take the pills"" and ""I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide"" frame the content as advice or information for a general audience or someone else.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post discusses the topic of suicide and methods (overdosing) but does so in a purely informational and cautionary way, directed at others. The crucial rule ""The suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, not others mentioned"" is key here. There is no indication that the *poster* is experiencing suicidal thoughts, making plans, or has attempted suicide. The post does not fit Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt, as these categories require the *poster* to express personal intent, plans, or past actions. The ""Indicator"" category is defined by a lack of explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent *from the poster*. While the post doesn't show the poster's personal distress, it *does* discuss the topic of death and suicide without expressing the poster's own suicidal intent, making it the most appropriate classification among the given options for a post that addresses suicide but not the poster's own risk.

It describes the *quality* of life as unbearable but does not indicate a desire to *end* that life.

However, it completely lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent, thoughts, plans, or actions related to the poster's own life.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""ive overdosed twice... once on purpose""). The 'Attempt' definition states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear.""

    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: The post explicitly states, ""I want to die more than ever."" It also implies a desire to end life with ""I can't have this life it's too painful.""
    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""anxious,"" ""painful,"" ""doubt everything,"" ""worthless,"" ""fail,"" ""too hard."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: None are mentioned. There is no mention of tools, locations, or actions taken towards a specific suicide plan.
    *   **References to past attempts**: The phrase ""Everytime I try I fail"" is present. While this *could* be interpreted as past attempts, it is highly ambiguous and could also refer to general life struggles or attempts to cope. It does not clearly describe an initiated action with suicidal intent. For the 'Attempt' category, a concrete action must have been initiated.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? **Yes**. The post explicitly states, ""I want to die more than ever.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes**. ""I want to die more than ever"" and ""I can't have this life it's too painful.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is explicit here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? **No**.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No**.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? **No**. While the desire to die is strong (""more than ever""), there is no indication of immediate timing like ""tonight"" or ""now.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The primary suicidal statement (""I want to die more than ever"") refers to a current feeling/intention.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? The phrase ""Everytime I try I fail"" is too vague to definitively describe a past suicide attempt. It lacks the specificity required for the 'Attempt' category (e.g., ""I put a belt around my neck but stopped"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   **Indicator**: This is ruled out because there is an explicit statement of wanting to die (""I want to die more than ever""), which goes beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation**: This category fits well. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to die more than ever,"" ""I can't have this life it's too painful"") without describing specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing for an action. The ambiguity of ""Everytime I try I fail"" does not elevate it to 'Attempt'.
    *   **Behavior**: This is ruled out because there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or strong imminent intent mentioned.
    *   **Attempt**: This is ruled out because there is no clear and concrete description of a past suicide attempt (an initiated action with suicidal intent). The phrase ""Everytime I try I fail"" is too vague to meet this criterion.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
- Mentions ""suicide by hanging,"" which is an explicit mention of suicide and a specific method.
- States ""ive alr tied the noose,"" indicating a concrete preparatory action taken.
- Expresses ""still not sure,"" showing hesitation but not negating the action taken.
- Asks for honesty about the painfulness, implying serious consideration of the method.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""suicide by hanging.""
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the question about the experience of hanging and the act of tying the noose strongly imply a desire to end life.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""hanging.""
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""ive alr tied the noose"" is a clear preparatory action.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent? The act of tying the noose suggests a high level of intent, even with stated hesitation.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions, as the noose is tied and the person is contemplating the act.
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) because it includes a specific method (""hanging"") and a concrete preparatory action (""tied the noose""). It does not describe a past completed or interrupted attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'. The presence of a specific plan and preparation places it firmly in the 'Behavior' category.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die because of them.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** Shame (""I'm a pervert""), distress, self-loathing.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No.
*   **References to past attempts:** No.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""Should I kill myself?"" (explicit question) and ""I want to die"" (explicit desire).
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? No, it's a question and a statement of desire, not an imminent action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly states suicidal thoughts (""Should I kill myself?"", ""I want to die"") but does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or descriptions of past attempts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because of the explicit suicidal intent, but does not include concrete steps or actions (Behavior/Attempt).

*   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

*   **If unclear, consider emotional context:** The severe distress, anger, and despair support the interpretation of ""i just wanna end it"" as suicidal intent.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
*   **Are there signs of preparation or actions taken?** No.
*   **Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method?** The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" expresses a current desire, but does not specify imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or concrete steps.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** ""i just wanna end it"" refers to a current desire/intention.
*   **Are past attempts described?** No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
*   The post goes beyond general distress or vague references to death, as ""i just wanna end it"" clearly implies suicidal intent. This rules out 'Indicator'.
*   The post expresses a clear desire to end life but does not include any specific plan, method, preparations, actions taken, or strong imminent timing. This fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions.""
*   There is no specific plan, method, preparations, actions taken, or strong imminent timing (like ""tonight"" or ""now"") that would classify it as 'Behavior'.
*   There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.

There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant. Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""anyone on the brink of suicide""). It also refers to past feelings of ""couldn't cope"" and being ""on the brink of suicide."" However, these are presented as past states that were *avoided* by an alternative, and the author states they are ""a functional member of society at the moment.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** Describes past feelings of being unable to cope. The overall tone is reflective and offers a coping strategy, rather than expressing current despair or hopelessness.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The preparations described are for going vagrant, which is presented as an *alternative* to suicide.
*   **References to past attempts:** The post describes past *feelings* of being ""on the brink of suicide"" but does not describe any initiated suicide *attempts*. It states ""the road has saved me,"" implying that it prevented an attempt, rather than being an interrupted one.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned, but in the context of offering an alternative to it, and reflecting on past feelings of being ""on the brink.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The author is discussing an *alternative* to suicide and states they are ""a functional member of society at the moment.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No, not for suicide.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No. The author is functional and the alternative is for ""should I ever need it again.""

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past feelings (""felt like I couldn't cope,"" ""hit the road"") and a future *contingency* (""should I ever need it again""). The author explicitly states, ""I am a functional member of society at the moment.""
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No. Past feelings of being ""on the brink"" are described, but not an actual suicide attempt. The ""road has saved me"" from suicide, not as an interrupted attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post discusses suicide as a concept and reflects on past personal struggles where the author felt ""on the brink."" However, it explicitly states the author is currently ""a functional member of society"" and describes an *alternative* to suicide that ""saved"" them in the past. There is no current explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent, no plans, and no description of a past attempt. While suicide is mentioned, it's not expressed as a current desire or action. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which describes general distress or vague references to death without clear current suicidal intent. The author is not expressing a desire to die, but rather reflecting on how they avoided it and offering a coping mechanism.

*   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm/implications of wanting to end life**: The phrases ""I think this is it mfs,"" ""I can't go on anymore,"" and ""then end it"" strongly imply a desire to end one's life.
*   **Emotional indicators**: The post expresses severe distress, loneliness, hopelessness, regret, and despair (""My life has been getting worse,"" ""addiction for years,"" ""so lonely,"" ""I fucked up my life,"" ""miss being happy"").
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: While a specific *method* isn't detailed (e.g., ""pills""), the post clearly states *imminent timing* (""tonight"") and a clear *intent* to act (""then end it""). Being ""drunk in my basement"" could be considered part of the preparation or context for the intended action.
*   **References to past attempts**: None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""I think this is it mfs,"" ""I can't go on anymore,"" and ""then end it"" are strong implications of suicidal intent.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""then end it.""
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: Severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' This post has severe distress and clear implied intent.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a specific physical method, but the *action* ""end it"" is stated with *imminent timing*.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Being ""drunk in my basement"" and stating ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" indicates a state and imminent intent to act.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes, ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" clearly indicates imminent intent. This leans toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.'

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to current/future intentions, specifically ""tonight.""
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   This post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to the strong implication of suicidal intent and imminent timing.
*   It goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) because it includes a clear statement of imminent timing (""tonight"") and an intent to act (""then end it""), which aligns with the ""strong intent with imminent timing"" aspect of the Behavior definition.
*   It does not describe a past initiated action, so it is not an Attempt.
*   Therefore, the presence of explicit/strongly implied suicidal thoughts combined with strong intent and imminent timing (""tonight... then end it"") fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

- Mentions of death/suicide: ""end my life"" is explicit.
- Emotional indicators: Implied severe distress and a desire to die, leading to a question about method efficacy.
- Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"" are specific substances (methods). ""Have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"" indicates possession/availability, which is a form of preparation. The question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" directly relates to the efficacy of these specific methods, implying active consideration and planning.
- Past attempts: None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

- Does the post suggest imminent intent? While no specific timing is given, the direct question about the success of a specific method, combined with possession of the means, indicates a strong, active consideration of action, moving beyond mere ideation.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The question ""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"" refers to a potential future action.
- Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly states suicidal intent (""end my life"") and provides specific methods (""800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen""). The statement ""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"" indicates possession/preparation. The question about the success of these methods (""Will I be able to successfully end my life?"") shows a clear move from mere thoughts to considering the practical execution of a plan. This fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan/method and implied preparation. It is not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts by mentioning specific means and asking about their efficacy. It is not 'Attempt' as no action has been initiated or completed.

The phrases ""resisting the desire to end"" and ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"" are strong implications of suicidal thoughts.

It includes very strong expressions of suicidal intent. While no specific plan or method is mentioned, the phrase ""i cant stand being here any other moment"" indicates a profound and immediate inability to continue living, which fits the ""strong intent with imminent timing"" aspect of the 'Behavior' category.

*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""suicidal thoughts are always there."" The question about dying from pills, coupled with the intent to take them, strongly implies a connection to suicidal intent, even if the immediate stated goal is ""calm.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts are always there"" and the question about dying from the pills, despite the ""don't wanna die rn"" qualifier, indicates a contemplation of actions that could lead to death, driven by these thoughts.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""taking 3 xanax pills.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? The user states ""i will do it anyway,"" indicating a clear intent to take the pills. This signifies an imminent action.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? A method is explicitly stated, and the intent to use it is clear.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. ""i will do it anyway"" refers to an action the user intends to take.
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts are always there."" It then details a specific method (""taking 3 xanax pills"") and expresses a clear intent to carry out this action (""i will do it anyway""), while simultaneously asking about the potential for death from this action. This goes beyond mere ideation (thoughts) and moves into the realm of contemplating and intending a specific action with a method, which aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not an 'Attempt' as no past action is described. It is not 'Ideation' because a specific method and intent to act are present. It is not an 'Indicator' as suicidal intent is clearly present and connected to a specific action.

*   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses extreme self-loathing (""shitface,"" ""fucking monster,"" ""piece of human garbage""), despair (""I don't know what to do at this point""), and guilt (""i hurt my friend"").
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The question about self-harm locations is a query for information, not a statement of a plan or action.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""i will wait until I can kill myself.""
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is explicit.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No, the suicidal intent is conditional (""if he is dead"") and not presented as immediate or imminent.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   This post goes beyond 'Indicator' because it has explicit suicidal intent and a specific method.
*   It goes beyond 'Ideation' because it includes a *specific plan or method* (""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground""), which is excluded from the 'Ideation' definition.
*   It fits 'Behavior' because it includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""so tempted to... plummet to the ground"") *plus* a specific plan or method (""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"").

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrase ""more dead inside"" is used, which is a metaphor for emotional numbness or despair, not literal death. ""Im done with everything"" expresses extreme frustration and hopelessness, but does not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys feelings of betrayal, loneliness (""nobody cares about me at all""), despair, frustration (""done being played with,"" ""done trying my best but getting no results""), and emotional exhaustion (""done with everything"").

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? No. ""More dead inside"" is metaphorical. ""Done with everything"" expresses severe emotional exhaustion and resignation, but does not strongly imply a direct desire to die.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression. The implication is weak and ambiguous, leaning more towards emotional despair than suicidal intent.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The distress is severe, but the intent to die is not clearly implied.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post expresses profound emotional pain, hopelessness, and a feeling of being ""done"" with current struggles and relationships. However, it lacks any explicit or strongly implied statements of wanting to die, specific suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or references to past attempts. The phrase ""more dead inside"" is metaphorical, and ""done with everything"" signifies extreme exhaustion and resignation rather than a direct suicidal desire. This fits the definition of 'Indicator' which describes general distress, sadness, or vague references to death without a clear desire to die, and notes that severe hopelessness alone isn’t enough to move beyond this category without explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent.

    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of a past completed or interrupted *attempt* (e.g., ""I tried to overdose""). The ""writing suicide notes"" is presented as a recurring action when depression is severe.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""writing suicide notes"" is an explicit mention of a suicide-related action, strongly implying suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? While not explicitly ""I want to die,"" the act of ""writing suicide notes"" is a direct preparation for ending one's life, thus implying a desire to die.

    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The phrase ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" suggests that this preparatory action occurs when the user is in severe distress, implying a recurring or potential imminent risk, even without a specific timeline like ""tonight.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes"" indicates a recurring pattern. It describes actions that have happened in the past and implies they could happen again in the present/future under similar circumstances. It is not describing a past *attempt* that was initiated and stopped, but rather a preparatory *behavior*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This is too low. The post goes beyond general distress and explicitly mentions a suicide-related action.
    *   **Ideation:** This is too low. While there is clear ideation implied by the ""suicide notes,"" the act of ""writing suicide notes"" moves it beyond mere thoughts into a concrete preparatory action.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (implied by writing notes) *plus* ""preparations or actions taken"" (""writing suicide notes""). This is a clear bridge between ideation and a full attempt.
    *   **Attempt:** This is too high. The post describes ""writing suicide notes"" as a preparatory action, not an actual initiated suicide attempt (e.g., ""I put a belt around my neck but stopped"").

""People dying is funny"" and ""hope that asshole dies"" are general, but ""hope i die"" is self-referential. ""fuck me fuck da world"" expresses extreme despair.
- Emotional indicators: ""suffering mentally,"" ""all depressed,"" ""no one cares,"" ""need attention,"" ""fuck me fuck da world."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing.
- Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned.
- References to past attempts: None are mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""hope i die"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""hope i die.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? No.
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? No, ""maybe then ill get a good chuckle"" suggests a thought, not an immediate, imminent plan.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intention (""hope i die"").
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
- The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""hope i die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
- There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or actions taken, nor is there a clear statement of imminent intent with a specific timeframe. This rules out 'Behavior'.
- There is no description of a past suicide attempt, completed or interrupted. This rules out 'Attempt'.
- The post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., 'I want to die,' 'I’m going to die soon') without specific plans or actions."" The phrase ""hope i die"" falls squarely into this definition.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm**: The phrase ""Just cut to deep"" strongly implies an act of self-harm, specifically cutting, and indicates the severity of the injury.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""Ah."" and ""fuck"" convey distress, pain, or frustration.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: ""cut"" is a specific method, and ""to deep"" indicates the severity of the action taken.
*   **References to past attempts**: The word ""Just"" suggests a very recent or ongoing action, not a past, completed, or interrupted attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" While ""cut to deep"" describes a severe act of self-harm, it doesn't explicitly state suicidal intent (e.g., ""I cut myself to die""). The implication of suicidal intent is indirect, derived from the severity of the self-harm.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No direct expression. The implication is through the extreme nature of the self-harm.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""Just cut to deep"" describes an action that has been taken.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? It describes an action that has just occurred.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Just cut"" indicates a very recent or current event.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   **Indicator**: This category is too low. The post describes a specific, severe act of self-harm, which goes beyond general distress or vague references to death.
*   **Ideation**: This category is incorrect because the post describes a concrete action (""cut""), not just thoughts or feelings.
*   **Attempt**: This category describes a *past suicide attempt* with clear suicidal intent. While ""cut to deep"" is a severe action, the post doesn't explicitly state it was a *suicide* attempt (i.e., with the intent to die), nor does it describe it as a past, completed, or interrupted attempt in the context of ending one's life. The word ""Just"" implies very recent action.
*   **Behavior**: This category requires ""explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts *plus* either: (1) a specific plan or method, (2) preparations or actions taken, or (3) strong intent with imminent timing."" The post clearly describes ""actions taken"" (""Just cut to deep""). While suicidal intent isn't explicitly stated, the severity implied by ""to deep"" in the context of self-harm strongly implies a high level of distress and potential suicidal ideation or a disregard for life, making it a form of suicidal behavior. The action itself is dangerous and indicative of significant risk.

They only do that so they can feel good about themselves. ""Ah I'm such a good person"" they say to themselves. You're not. You're an attention hungry piece of shit that feeds off the misery of others",0,indicator,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
-   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. It reacts to phrases like ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"", which *implies* the poster is in a context where such interventions are being made. However, the post itself does not state a desire to die or end one's life.
-   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme anger, frustration, contempt, and possibly despair are present, but the primary emotion conveyed is rage directed at others.
-   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
-   **References to past attempts:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
-   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")?** No. The post reacts to messages about suicide (""don't do it!""), but the poster *themselves* does not express suicidal intent. The post is a critique of the people giving advice, not a statement of the poster's own suicidal feelings.
-   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expressions. Any implication is indirect, inferred from the type of messages the poster is receiving, rather than from the poster's own stated desire.
-   **If unclear, consider emotional context:** Severe distress (anger) is present, but suicidal intent is *not* clearly implied by the poster's own words. The focus is on the ""attention hungry"" nature of others.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
-   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
-   **Are there signs of preparation or actions taken?** No.
-   **Does the post suggest imminent intent?** No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
-   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** No reference to past attempts or current/future suicidal intentions. The post is a current rant about other people's behavior.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post expresses intense anger and frustration, and it exists in a context where suicidal thoughts might be present (as evidenced by the ""don't do it!"" messages it's reacting to). However, the post itself does not contain any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent, thoughts, plans, or actions by the poster. It is a criticism of others, not a declaration of self-harm. Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category, as it shows general distress but lacks the direct or strongly implied suicidal intent required for 'Ideation' or higher.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrase ""i kinda just wanna die"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation, even with the accompanying ambivalence.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses significant distress, including feeling lost (""i dont really know what i want""), anhedonia (""i struggle to get up i find everything boring""), loneliness (""my friends are the only thing keeping me going and i dont have many since they all left""), and struggles with bullying and school (""i get bullied so stopped attending school i dont have good grades"").

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, the phrase ""kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time"" indicates a general feeling rather than an imminent plan.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings/intentions.
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains an explicit expression of wanting to die (""i kinda just wanna die""), which moves it beyond general distress (Indicator). However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent (which would classify it as Behavior). It also does not describe a past attempt (Attempt). Therefore, it fits the definition of Ideation: ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions."" The ambivalence (""but dont at the same time"") is common in ideation and does not negate the presence of the suicidal thought itself.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""want to justify dying,"" and ""thinking about partially planning to die.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""guilty,"" ""anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse,"" ""feel terrible,"" ""terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive.""
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips"" (acknowledges lack of *strong* methods but implies consideration of *some* methods). Crucially, ""partially planning to die"" indicates a step beyond mere ideation towards conceptualizing a plan.
*   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""want to justify dying,"" ""partially planning to die.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""want to justify dying.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific, detailed method is given.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No explicit actions or preparations. However, ""partially planning to die"" indicates a cognitive step towards outlining a plan, even if incomplete.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? Not explicitly ""tonight,"" but the high frequency of thoughts (""most of the time for the past few months,"" ""every single day"") and the statement ""I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst"" suggest a high, ongoing risk and potential for rapid escalation. The desire to tell a friend ""as a warning"" also implies a sense of worsening state.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions and ongoing thoughts (""been having suicidal thoughts for a while now,"" ""thinking about it most of the time,"" ""every single day I feel terrible,"" ""wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes beyond mere ""Ideation"" due to the phrase ""partially planning to die."" While no specific, detailed method or imminent timing is provided, the mention of ""planning"" indicates a move from passive thoughts or desires to a more active, cognitive process of outlining how to end one's life. This aligns with the ""Behavior"" category, which includes ""a specific plan or method"" even if not fully concrete or detailed, bridging thoughts and actions. The constant nature of the thoughts and the acknowledged impulsivity also elevate the risk beyond pure ideation. It does not describe a past attempt.

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' While ""tonight"" isn't used, the shift in resolve (""now i really don't care any more"") combined with the detailed plan indicates strong, current intent to act.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? This refers to current thoughts and future intentions/plans (""I've been thinking I could just drive out..."").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No. The post states ""too scared to end it,"" indicating past ideation but no attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**

Crucially, it also includes a specific plan and method (""drive out into the mountains and hike... find a nice little spot to hang myself""). This combination of explicit ideation and a concrete plan/method fits the definition of 'Behavior'. It does not describe a past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. It is far beyond general distress or vague references, ruling out 'Indicator'. It includes a specific plan, which distinguishes it from 'Ideation'.

The user expresses severe distress (""fix my fucked up self,"" ""don't even have the motivation to get up anymore,"" ""depression and anxiety"") but the desire is to get therapy to ""fix"" themselves, not to die.
*   **Emotional indicators:** Severe distress, depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, fear (of parents' reaction), hopelessness (about accessing therapy).
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
*   **References to past attempts:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No. The post focuses on the inability to access therapy due to parental issues and financial constraints, despite significant mental health struggles.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user wants to ""fix"" their ""fucked up self"" through therapy, indicating a desire to improve their life, not end it.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: The post shows severe distress but does not contain any implied intent to die. The distress is about their current state and the barrier to getting help.

*   **Emotional indicators:** ""sigh,"" ""i wish i wasn't like this :("" indicate distress and frustration.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The user states that watching a video ""didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method"" (eye drops in beverages). This identifies a specific *method idea*. However, there are no signs of preparation or actions taken.
*   **References to past attempts:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""new suicide method"" are explicit.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" implies this, even with internal conflict.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""eye drops in his beverages"" is identified as a ""new suicide method"" idea.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No. The user states, ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that,"" indicating active suppression and a lack of imminent intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current thoughts and consideration of a potential future method.
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
*   **Indicator:** This is not an Indicator post because there are explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and a specific method idea, going beyond general distress.
*   **Ideation:** The post clearly includes explicit suicidal thoughts. It also mentions ""an idea of a new suicide method."" While this is a specific method, it is presented as an ""idea"" rather than a concrete ""plan"" with intent. Crucially, the user explicitly states they ""try to suppress"" these thoughts and ""really don't want to have to do that,"" indicating a lack of strong intent or imminence. This fits the definition of Ideation, which includes explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans *or actions*, and stops short of concrete steps. The ""idea"" of a method is still within the realm of thought, not action or concrete planning.
*   **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan or method *plus* strong intent, preparations, or imminent timing. While a specific method idea is present, the active suppression and stated lack of desire to act on it prevent it from being classified as Behavior. There are no preparations or imminent timing.
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt is described.

Based on the analysis, the post describes explicit suicidal thoughts and the identification of a specific method as an ""idea,"" but lacks the intent, planning, or actions required for the Behavior category.

I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Explicitly mentions ""suicide note,"" ""stopped responding to calls or going to work"" (implying absence due to death), ""free myself of my problems"" (implying ending life), and ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" (future suicidal intent).
*   **Emotional indicators:** Self-blame (""I'm the common denominator""), despair, frustration (""can't even fucking free myself""), and a desire to regain a ""rush of calm"" associated with suicidal planning.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted,"" ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place.""
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** ""Then sabotaged myself"" and ""blocking my own shot"" directly describe an action that was initiated or on the verge of initiation with suicidal intent, but was self-interrupted or incomplete.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes.** ""suicide note,"" ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes.** ""so nobody wonders why I stopped responding to calls or going to work,"" ""free myself of my problems.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *method* (e.g., pills, jump) is mentioned, but detailed *planning* is described: ""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **Yes.** ""wrote a suicide note,"" ""primed and ready to be posted.""
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The desire to ""coax the feeling back out"" and ""Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" suggests current ideation and future intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""A month ago I wrote a suicide note. ... Then sabotaged myself"" describes a past event. ""I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out... Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" describes current feelings and future intentions.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? **Yes.** ""Then sabotaged myself"" after having ""Planned everything out"" and having a note ""primed and ready"" clearly indicates an incomplete or self-interrupted action with suicidal intent.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly describes a past event where a suicide note was written, a plan was made, and the action was ""sabotaged"" or ""blocked,"" which fits the definition of an incomplete or self-interrupted suicide attempt. The presence of current ideation and future intent does not override the clear description of a past attempt, as per the rules: ""If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear.""

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrase ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" strongly implies a contemplation of non-existence or suicidal ideation. ""I am hanging on by threads at this moment"" indicates being at a breaking point.
*   **Emotional indicators:** Severe suffering, hopelessness, despair, loneliness, feeling unloved, forgotten, like an outcast, intense physical and emotional pain, crying.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" is a strong implication of wanting to not be alive.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase above implies a desire for non-existence.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The post is filled with severe distress, and the implied intent is present.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No. In fact, the post states ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present,"" indicating a current choice to *not* act, despite the pain.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to current feelings and ongoing struggles, with a contemplation of future non-existence.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) by strongly implying a desire for non-existence (""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone""). However, it does not mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent (which would place it in Behavior), nor does it describe a past attempt. The presence of suicidal thoughts/feelings without concrete plans or actions aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation. The statement about ""the reason I stay now"" further confirms that the thoughts are present, but no action is being taken or planned.

    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions (""So Tuesday, I'm either going to..."").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly states suicidal intent (""make me want to die,"" ""I'm done with life"").
    *   It includes specific methods (""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself from a tree"").
    *   It also provides a specific timeframe for these actions (""So Tuesday"").
    *   This combination of explicit ideation, specific plan/method, and imminent timing fits the definition of 'Behavior' (""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts plus either: (1) a specific plan or method... or (3) strong intent with imminent timing""). It does not describe a past completed or interrupted action, so it is not 'Attempt'. It goes beyond just thoughts, so it is not 'Ideation' or 'Indicator'.

217,"Having a lot of suicidal thoughts but I dont think im depressed. Throwaway because people I know, know my main acc. Turned 17 in Jan. Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice?

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The user explicitly states ""10x more suicidal"" and is seeking a hotline for these feelings, implying current suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""worried,"" ""paranoid,"" ""in so much pain"" (implied by the need for a hotline).
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific current plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** The user describes a past incident where they called a hotline, ""didn't have a method or anything,"" and subsequently had police called and were hospitalized. This clarifies that the past event was an intervention due to ideation, not a past suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""10x more suicidal."" The entire post is about seeking a way to discuss suicidal feelings without intervention.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not a direct ""I want to die now,"" but the phrase ""10x more suicidal"" strongly implies current suicidal thoughts and distress.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The distress is high, and the implied intent is to manage current suicidal feelings.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No. The user is asking for resources to *talk* about their feelings, not describing an immediate action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a past negative experience with a hotline that *increased* their suicidal feelings, and a *current/future intention* to find a hotline that won't intervene, indicating ongoing suicidal ideation.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No. The user explicitly states ""didn't have a method or anything"" during the past incident, ruling out a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post explicitly mentions being ""10x more suicidal,"" which goes beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** Fits well. The post clearly indicates current suicidal thoughts (""10x more suicidal"") and a desire to seek help for these feelings, without any mention of specific plans, methods, or imminent actions. The past event was an intervention due to ideation, not an attempt.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent described for the present moment.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. The user explicitly states they ""didn't have a method or anything"" last time, clarifying it was not a past attempt.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"" in reference to others' perceptions and states ""They won't believe it until I die."" The core of the post is a desperate plea for their pain to be acknowledged, indicating a severe internal struggle. The phrases ""IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP"" strongly imply the author is battling suicidal thoughts and is actively trying to resist them or seek assistance.
*   **Emotional indicators:** Intense rage, anger, frustration, feeling neglected, misunderstood, and despair.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
*   **References to past attempts:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""Suicidal"" is used, and ""They won't believe it until I die"" is a strong implication of a potential suicidal outcome if their distress is not addressed. The user is defending the act of speaking about suicidal feelings, which, combined with their own struggle to ""hold on"" and need for help, indicates they are experiencing such feelings.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""They won't believe it until I die"" is a powerful implied expression of the severity of their pain and the potential consequence, and the struggle to ""hold on"" directly implies a fight against the desire to give up.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No. The post is about the ongoing struggle and the need for help.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) by strongly implying suicidal thoughts and feelings through the user's defense of speaking out about suicide, their active struggle to ""hold on,"" and the statement ""They won't believe it until I die."" However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent (Behavior), nor does it describe a past attempt (Attempt). Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Ideation' due to the strong implication of suicidal thoughts and feelings without concrete plans or actions.

    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions, ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer,"" which refers to past contemplation or delaying action, not a past initiated attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

*   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""I can't stop cutting,"" which is ongoing self-harm, but it does not describe a past *suicide attempt* with intent to die.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes.** The phrases ""I'm going to kms"" and ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"" are explicit.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes.**
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: N/A, intent is explicit.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? **No.**
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No.** (Cutting is mentioned as ongoing self-harm, not as an action taken *towards* suicide in this context).
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The post says ""very soon"" and ""about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog."" The ""just not yet"" and the protective factor (the dog) indicate that while the intent is strong and accepted, it is not *imminent* (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily **current acceptance of future intentions** (""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? **No** clear past suicide attempt is described.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit and strong expressions of suicidal intent (""I'm going to kms,"" ""I'm going to kill myself very soon""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'. However, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparations. While the intent is strong and accepted, the timing is described as ""very soon"" and ""just not yet,"" indicating it's not *imminent* in the sense required for 'Behavior' (which often implies ""tonight"" or ""now"" without a method). There is no description of a past suicide attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'. Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and feelings without concrete steps or imminent action.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

*   **Emotional indicators:** Resentment, anger, despair, hopelessness, feeling misunderstood.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""one of my suicide notes I threw away"" (past preparation). ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" (desire for a method, not a concrete plan or action taken).
*   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of a past attempt (e.g., ""I tried to...""). The suicide notes were a preparation, not an attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: N/A, clearly explicit.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""shoot myself"" (as a wish).
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""one of my suicide notes I threw away"" (a past preparation, not current/imminent).
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The phrase ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"" indicates a strong desire for immediate action, but it's phrased as a wish, not a concrete plan or action being taken.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The intervention and writing/throwing away notes are past events. The suicidal thoughts and desires (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""makes me wanna ruin their lives,"" ""wish I could shoot myself"") are current intentions/feelings.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit and strong suicidal thoughts and desires (""I wanna kill myself,"" ""wish I could shoot myself""). It mentions a method (shooting oneself) but as a wish, not a concrete plan being acted upon. It also mentions past preparations (suicide notes) that were discarded, but not current, active preparations for an imminent act. There is no description of a completed or interrupted suicide attempt. While the desire for immediate action is present (""on the spot""), it's still framed as a wish, not an active step or imminent plan. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes explicit suicidal thoughts and feelings, even with mention of a method, without concrete plans or actions being taken.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. ""OD,"" ""month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal,"" ""popping all of them at once.""
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? The user possesses the means (medication) and states an imminent intent to use them (""today"").
- Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes, ""today.""

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""going to OD today,"" ""pop all of them at once""). It also mentions past ideation (""been thinking about suicide for a while now"").
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No, only past ideation.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""thinking about suicide,"" ""going to OD"") and includes a specific plan/method (""OD with listed medications"") along with an imminent timeframe (""today""). The user has the means available. This aligns directly with the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not 'Ideation' because there is a specific plan/method and imminent intent. It is not 'Attempt' because it describes future intent, not a past action.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" is a strong implication of wanting to end one's life. The overall tone, including apologies and thank yous to loved ones, strongly resembles a farewell message often preceding suicidal action.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""Sorry,"" ""nothing left,"" ""completely used up,"" ""sorry I wasn't a better person"" indicate despair, hopelessness, exhaustion, and guilt.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" combined with the farewell messages strongly implies suicidal intent.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" and the farewell nature.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: Severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' This post shows severe distress and strong implied intent.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No explicit actions or preparations are mentioned.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes. The farewell messages (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you..."", ""Love you Mom, Dad..."", ""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person"") combined with ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" strongly suggest imminent intent, even without a specific timeline or method. This tone goes beyond passive ideation and implies a decision has been made and action is pending.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" indicates a present state of mind with a future-oriented, imminent implication.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
*   **Indicator:** This post goes beyond general distress; it contains strong implied suicidal intent and a farewell tone.
*   **Ideation:** While it includes strongly implied suicidal thoughts, the farewell nature and the phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" elevate it beyond mere thoughts. It suggests a strong, immediate intent to act, rather than just contemplating.
*   **Behavior:** The post does not mention a specific plan or method, nor explicit preparations. However, the definition of 'Behavior' includes ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method."" The comprehensive farewell message (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt..."", ""Love you Mom, Dad..."", ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"") conveys a profound sense of finality and imminent action, characteristic of a pre-suicidal state or a goodbye note. This strong implied imminent intent, even without an explicit ""tonight"" or a method, aligns with the 'Behavior' category.
*   **Attempt:** No past attempt is described.

The strong farewell nature and the phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" indicate a critical level of intent that suggests imminent action, classifying it as 'Behavior'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""feel so bad,"" ""feel terrible terrible,"" ""My mind is going crazy,"" ""incredibly overwhelmed,"" ""can't even cry."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A specific method is mentioned: ""cutting my god damn throat."" There are no explicit preparations or actions taken described, but the method is clear.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are described. ""I was already suicidal"" refers to a past state of mind, not a past action.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""I was already suicidal"" is explicit. ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent using a specific method.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The desire to ""shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" is a direct expression of wanting to end one's life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. The post contains explicit suicidal intent and a specific method, going beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect. While there are suicidal thoughts, the inclusion of a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") moves it beyond mere ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** Correct. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I was already suicidal,"" ""all I want to do..."") plus a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat""). This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior' which includes ""explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts plus either: (1) a specific plan or method.""

    *   The poster is not expressing distress, ideation, plans, or past attempts. They are simply asking for information about a quote that contains suicidal themes.
    *   This post lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent *from the poster*. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt. It fits the definition of 'Indicator' because it lacks personal suicidal intent from the poster.

    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: The emotional context (severe distress, hopelessness, acceptance of life not getting better) combined with the direct statements clearly points to suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The phrase ""now i'm ready to join my dog"" indicates a current state of readiness and acceptance of death. However, it does not specify *imminent timing* for an action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""right now I'm going to...""). It expresses a strong desire and preparedness for death, but not a concrete, time-bound intent to act *immediately*. This is a crucial distinction from 'Behavior'.

The statement ""now i'm ready"" signifies a strong desire and acceptance of ending life, fitting within the range of ""stronger desires to end life"" without concrete steps.
    *   **Behavior**: Ruled out because there is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, or actions taken.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" It also says, ""his passing has saved my life for the time being."" This clearly indicates past suicidal intent and a current reprieve.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys a sense of past despair (""I had previously made up my mind"") and a newfound appreciation for life due to witnessing grief.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A past plan with a timeline (""before Christmas hit"") is mentioned, but no specific method or preparations are detailed. Crucially, the post states, ""Now, I know I can't do that,"" indicating the plan is currently rescinded.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a past *intention/plan* but explicitly states it was *not carried out* (""his passing has saved my life for the time being""). No action was initiated.

    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, it explicitly states, ""Now, I know I can't do that"" and ""his passing has saved my life for the time being,"" indicating a lack of *current* imminent intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a *past intention/plan* (""I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit""). It then describes a *current change* in that intention, where the plan is temporarily abandoned (""Now, I know I can't do that,"" ""saved my life for the time being"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No. The post describes a past *plan* that was *not initiated* and has now been *abandoned* for the time being.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This is too weak. The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and a past concrete plan.
    *   **Attempt:** The post clearly states the plan was *not* carried out; no action was initiated.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires *current* explicit suicidal thoughts *plus* a specific plan/method, preparations/actions, or strong *imminent* intent. While a past plan was mentioned, the post explicitly states that the user ""can't do that"" now and that their life was ""saved for the time being."" This negates the *current* imminent intent or action required for 'Behavior'.
    *   **Ideation:** The post *describes* explicit suicidal thoughts and a past plan (""I was going to kill myself""). Even though the immediate intent to act is currently suspended, the post's content directly addresses the user's suicidal thoughts and past planning. The phrase ""Nothing has changed for me"" suggests the underlying issues persist, even if the immediate action is averted. The post is about the *presence* of suicidal thoughts and how an event *temporarily averted* action, rather than a complete resolution of ideation.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""I always think about suicide,"" ""triggers me to actually want to commit suicide""). The mention of ""research[ing] for easy painless ways to kill myself"" indicates a progression beyond passive thoughts, showing an active exploration of means to achieve suicide. However, it does not specify a chosen plan, method, preparations, or imminent intent. This fits the definition of Ideation, which includes explicit suicidal thoughts and stronger desires to end life, but stops short of concrete steps (which would be Behavior) or past actions (which would be Attempt).

    *   ""I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind.

    *   ""Death and suicide need to be normalized"" - Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and advocates for its acceptance, which suggests a personal contemplation or acceptance of it.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the description of a desired state ""on the other side"" without the burdens of life, combined with ""Life is useless,"" implies a desire to not be alive in the current form.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current beliefs/feelings and a desired future state, but not a past attempt or an imminent action.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a strong desire for an end to current existence (""Life is useless,"" desire for a state without human emotions, body, or mind). This clearly falls under ""explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings."" However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, actions taken, or imminent timing. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

*   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm**: The post explicitly mentions ""the thought of death"" and describes it in appealing terms (""beautiful,"" ""never feel pain anymore,"" ""To be nothing in a black sea of infinity,"" ""To let go after holding on so tight""). This strongly implies a desire for non-existence as an escape.
*   **Emotional indicators**: The desire to ""never feel pain anymore"" and ""never deal with the hassle"" indicates significant emotional distress and a longing for relief through death.
*   **Specific plans/methods/preparations**: None are mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts**: None are mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, the post strongly implies a desire for death and non-existence as a beautiful escape from pain.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""To never feel pain anymore,"" ""To be nothing in a black sea of infinity,"" and ""To let go after holding on so tight"" are strong implied expressions of wanting to cease to exist.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, it's a contemplation (""Ain't the thought... beautiful?""), not an declaration of immediate action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current contemplation and desire for the peace of death, not a past event or an immediate future action.
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post expresses a profound longing for death as an escape from suffering, describing it in positive terms. This clearly indicates suicidal thoughts and feelings (""I want to die"" is strongly implied by ""To never feel pain anymore,"" ""To be nothing,"" and ""To let go""). However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because of the clear implied desire for death, but stops short of concrete steps or imminent action (Behavior) or a past attempt (Attempt).

CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes. The post explicitly states, ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" It also mentions, ""the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore,"" and ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day."" The phrase ""my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer"" strongly implies a desire to end life.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses severe distress, hopelessness, loneliness, and feeling like an ""outcast."" Phrases like ""feeling like absolute shit,"" ""fucking tired,"" ""stuck in my head,"" ""no one i can go to,"" and ""receive jackshit"" indicate profound despair.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post outlines a conditional plan: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself."" While it doesn't name a *specific* method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump""), it states ""i'll use any method i can,"" which signifies a readiness and intent to find and use a method, rather than just contemplating.
*   **References to past attempts:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

*   Are specific methods mentioned? Not a named method, but a clear intent to use ""any method"" once a condition is met. This indicates a decision to act and find a means.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No specific preparations or actions taken *yet*.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes, the intent is conditional on the COVID results, but the statement ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"" combined with ""i'll use any method i can"" shows a strong, decided intent to act once that condition is met.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions based on a specific upcoming event (COVID test results).
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly moves beyond mere ideation. It contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'll kill myself"") and a conditional plan tied to a future event. The statement ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day"" indicates a strong intent to act and find a means, even if a specific method isn't named. This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, which includes ""explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts plus either: (1) a specific plan or method... or (3) strong intent with imminent timing... even without a method."" The conditional plan and readiness to use ""any method"" constitute a plan to act.

This combination of explicit suicidal thoughts, a specific plan/method, and imminent intent fits the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not 'Ideation' because there's a specific plan/method.

I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing.

As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool.

    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions being ""hospitalized in highschool for depression,"" but not specifically for a suicide attempt. It explicitly states, ""I've never purposely hurt myself,"" ruling out past self-harm actions.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes. The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I want to die.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is explicit here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No. The ideation about self-harm is explicitly stated as not acted upon.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No. The ""tonight"" reference is to lying in bed, hoping for a passive death, not an active suicidal intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The expressions ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day"" refer to current and ongoing intentions/thoughts.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No. The post explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"") and frequent suicidal thoughts (""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, the post does not describe any specific plans, methods, preparations, actions taken, or imminent intent to act on these thoughts. The self-harm ideation is explicitly stated as *not* having been acted upon. There is no mention of a past suicide attempt.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions.""

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: The phrase ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" is a strong, explicit expression of wanting to die.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""hurting,"" ""hurt so bad emotionally,"" ""so depressed,"" ""muscles ache,"" ""everything is so exhausting,"" ""my own body is giving up."" These indicate severe emotional and physical distress, hopelessness, and despair.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: No specific active method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, gathering tools) are mentioned. The wish is to ""die in my sleep,"" which is a passive desire for death rather than an active plan to cause it.
*   **References to past attempts**: None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied?** Yes, ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"" strongly implies a desire to die.
*   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes.
*   **If unclear, consider emotional context:** The severe distress (""so depressed,"" ""hurting so bad emotionally"") reinforces the implied intent to die.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No active method. ""Die in my sleep"" is a passive wish, not an active plan for self-harm.
*   **Are there signs of preparation or actions taken?** No.
*   **Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method?** ""Tonight"" suggests imminent timing for the desired outcome, but the *intent* is passive (""hoping I will die""), not active (""I'm going to *do* something""). This distinguishes it from 'Behavior', which requires an active plan or strong intent to *cause* death.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current/future intention (""tonight"").
*   **Are past attempts described?** No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   The post goes beyond general distress and explicitly states a desire to die (""hoping I will die in my sleep tonight""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
*   It clearly expresses suicidal thoughts/feelings. The phrase ""die in my sleep"" represents a strong desire to end life but lacks an active plan or concrete steps to achieve it. It's a passive wish for death.
*   It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.
*   It does not include a specific active plan, preparations, or an active intent to *cause* death (like ""I'm going to jump tonight"" or ""I have the pills""). The wish to ""die in my sleep"" is a passive form of ideation, even with a timeframe, and does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' which implies active steps or clear intent to self-harm.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Key elements**: The post explicitly mentions ""Zoloft overdose"" and ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg,"" indicating a specific action involving a substance. The phrase ""It obviously wasn't enough to kill me"" directly states the intent behind taking the pills (to die) and that the action was completed but unsuccessful in achieving the desired outcome. The temporal context ""at 11:30 I took"" confirms this was a past event. The user describes physical symptoms (""slight nausea and I'm really sweaty"") and asks for medical advice (""will I be okay if I don't go to hospital?"").

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""overdose"" in this context, combined with ""wasn't enough to kill me,"" explicitly states suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""wasn't enough to kill me"" clearly indicates a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""Zoloft overdose,"" ""took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg."" This is a specific method and quantity.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I took 6 pills"" is a concrete action taken.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, it describes an action that has already occurred.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrases ""at 11:30 I took"" and ""wasn't enough to kill me"" clearly refer to a past event.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes. The post describes taking pills with the intent to die, and the outcome (""wasn't enough to kill me"") signifies an initiated action with suicidal intent that was incomplete or unsuccessful.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post describes a concrete action (""took 6 pills"") that was initiated with suicidal intent (""to kill me""), and it explicitly states that the action was not successful in achieving death (""wasn't enough to kill me""). This perfectly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt', which includes ""past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions.""

*   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""suicide forum"" is an explicit mention and strong implication of suicidal intent.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, seeking a ""suicide forum"" strongly implies a desire to explore or act upon suicidal thoughts.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: Severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The distress is severe, and the intent to engage with suicide-related content is clear.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
*   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) by explicitly mentioning ""suicide"" and seeking a ""suicide forum,"" indicating clear suicidal intent.
*   However, it does not describe a specific plan, method, preparations, or imminent action (Behavior).
*   It does not describe a past attempt (Attempt).

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? ""I cannot wait to die"" expresses strong desire, but not necessarily *imminent timing* like ""tonight."" The focus on funeral costs is a future-oriented logistical thought, not an immediate action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I cannot wait to die,"" ""ill fix... funeral costs"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses a strong desire to die (""I cannot wait to die"") and thoughts about the consequences of death (""ill fix all of the funeral costs""). This explicitly indicates suicidal thoughts and feelings. However, it does not describe a specific method, an action taken *towards* the act of dying, or an indication of imminent timing that would elevate it to 'Behavior'.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied?** No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" The phrase ""what's really the point?"" is an implied questioning of the value of life, stemming from severe hopelessness. It's a vague reference to life not being worth living, but not a direct or strongly implied statement of wanting to die. The user is asking for ""wisdom,"" indicating they are grappling with the dilemma, not stating an intent to act.
    *   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expression. The implication is of profound meaninglessness, which is a precursor to suicidal thoughts but not the thought itself.
    *   **If unclear, consider emotional context:** Severe distress and hopelessness are present. However, the suicidal intent is not explicit or *strongly* implied as a desire to die. It's more of an existential crisis and a feeling that life has lost its meaning.

The post expresses profound hopelessness and a sense of being trapped in pain. The phrase ""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip"" strongly implies that death is the desired state of freedom from suffering, and the user's despair stems from the perceived impossibility of achieving this. This constitutes a ""strongly implied suicidal thought or feeling"" as per the definition of 'Ideation', even though it's framed as an inability to die rather than a direct desire to die. It does not include specific plans, methods, or actions, ruling out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'. It goes beyond general distress or vague references to death, as it explicitly links the inability to die with the inability to be free from pain, which is a clear implication of suicidal intent.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

*   **Emotional indicators**: Pain, doubt, apathy (""neither particularly excited about to put off by it""), and a sense of hopelessness.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: None are mentioned for *current* suicidal intent.
*   **References to past attempts**: The poster explicitly states, ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work..."" This is a clear description of a past, incomplete attempt by the poster.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. The poster explicitly mentions a past ""aborted attempt at suicide"" and strongly implies current suicidal thoughts (""welcome end to everything,"" ""state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from"").
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No, for current intent.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No, for current intent.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No. The poster is contemplating and mentions being held back by their parents.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. The post describes a past ""aborted attempt at suicide"" and also expresses current suicidal ideation.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains clear expressions of current suicidal ideation (""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything,"" ""the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from""). However, the most definitive element, according to the provided definitions, is the explicit mention of a past suicide attempt by the poster: ""I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago."" The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" Since a past attempt is clearly described, this category is the most appropriate.

There's no emotion anymore. No sadness, its just nothing. The pain in numb now, but that's nothing new. I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess. I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post expresses extreme hopelessness (""I can't continue this disappointment,"" ""There's not hope anymore,"" ""no joy anymore,"" ""no emotion anymore,"" ""just nothing""). Crucially, the phrase ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess"" is a clear and direct implication of suicidal intent and a specific method. The closing ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You"" serves as a farewell message, reinforcing this intent.
*   **Emotional indicators:** Despair, hopelessness, emotional numbness, a sense of being a disappointment, and finality.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" explicitly states a method and a location, along with a consideration for the aftermath (""less of a mess"").
*   **References to past attempts:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" is a strong implication of suicide, coupled with the farewell message.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I can't continue this disappointment,"" ""There's not hope anymore,"" and the explicit plan to ""do it"" clearly express a desire to end life.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""in the tub.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? The post describes a concrete plan (""I plan on doing it"") and a specific method, indicating a step beyond mere ideation.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The combination of profound hopelessness, a clear plan, and a farewell message strongly suggests imminent intent, even without a specific time like ""tonight.""

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I plan on doing it"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) and mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) because it includes a specific plan and method (""I plan on doing it in the tub""). It does not describe a past action that was initiated (Attempt). Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan or method.

253,Can someone just hug me please. I just want the pain to go away,0,indicator,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** No explicit mentions. The phrase ""I just want the pain to go away"" indicates severe emotional distress and a desire for relief, but it does not explicitly or strongly imply a desire to end one's life. It's a general plea for relief from suffering.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Can someone just hug me please"" indicates loneliness, despair, and a need for comfort. ""I just want the pain to go away"" indicates significant emotional pain and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")?** No. ""I just want the pain to go away"" is not a strong enough implication of suicidal intent to classify as 'ideation'. It expresses a desire for relief from suffering, which is a precursor to suicidal thoughts but not the thoughts themselves.
    *   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expression. The implied expression is weak; it's a desire for pain cessation, not explicitly for death.
    *   **If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.'** While there is severe distress, the *implied intent* for suicide is not strong enough to move it beyond 'indicator'. The statement focuses on the *pain* going away, not the *person* being gone.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No.
    *   **Are there signs of preparation or actions taken?** No.
    *   **Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method?** No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** Current emotional state and desire for relief.
    *   **Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones?** No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly shows general distress and suffering (""I just want the pain to go away,"" ""Can someone just hug me please"").
    *   It lacks explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to die soon""). The desire for ""pain to go away"" is a general desire for relief from suffering, not necessarily a desire for death.
    *   There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.
    *   Based on the definitions, 'Indicator' is the best fit: ""The post lacks explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent. It may show general distress, sadness... without a clear desire to die. Severe hopelessness alone isn’t enough—suicidal intent must be explicit or strongly implied to move beyond this category.""

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, explicitly stated: ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" The post details profound suffering and hopelessness.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Severe hopelessness, despair, loneliness, anger, feelings of failure, and chronic distress are evident throughout the post.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No explicit *suicide* plan (e.g., ""I will jump off a bridge""). However, the post describes concrete self-harming *actions taken* as a coping mechanism for distress: ""I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants... secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing."" These are ongoing, self-destructive behaviors.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No explicit past *suicide attempt* is described. The self-harming behaviors mentioned are ongoing, not a discrete, past attempt to end life.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? **Yes.** ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT."" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes.** ""wanting to end it.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is explicit here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Not for a *suicide plan* in the traditional sense. However, the post describes *actions taken* that are severely self-harming and are causing physical damage: ""addiction to use paracetamols,"" ""starve myself,"" ""damaged my liver my digestive system."" These are concrete, harmful behaviors.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **Yes.** The ongoing self-harm (addiction to painkillers, starving) constitutes ""actions taken"" in the context of severe distress and suicidal ideation.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The opening ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" indicates a current state of mind and intention, but no specific imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post refers to current intentions (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"") and ongoing self-harming behaviors.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No, a past *suicide attempt* is not described. The self-harm is presented as an ongoing coping mechanism.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect. While there is clear ideation, the post also describes concrete, self-harming *actions taken* that go beyond just thoughts.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" ""wanting to end it"") *plus* descriptions of ""actions taken"" in the form of severe, ongoing self-harm (paracetamol addiction, starving self, resulting physical damage). These actions are a direct response to the distress and are occurring in the context of suicidal ideation. The definition of 'Behavior' includes ""preparations or actions taken.""
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect. The post does not describe a discrete, past suicide attempt (e.g., ""I tried to overdose but stopped""). The self-harm is ongoing.

*   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"" (past ideation) and ""I feel like cutting myself again"" (past self-harm), but it does not describe a past *suicide attempt* that was initiated.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes**. ""I really want to fucking kill myself.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes**. ""I really want to fucking kill myself."" and the detailed description of dying by train.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? **Yes**. ""lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? The thought of ""running away to the train station"" indicates a planned action towards the method.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The post has both strong intent and a specific method.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The core suicidal intent (""I really want to fucking kill myself"") and the plan (""I'm thinking about running away..."") are current thoughts and future intentions. Past suicidal thoughts and self-harm are mentioned as context, but the primary risk is current.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No past *suicide attempts* are described. Past self-harm is mentioned, but not as an attempt to end life.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I really want to fucking kill myself""). Crucially, it also includes a specific plan/method (""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head""). This combination of explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan/method aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' because of the explicit intent and plan. It is not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond just thoughts to include a specific plan. It is not 'Attempt' because no past initiated suicide action is described.

The definition of 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent. If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" The mention of ""a few suicide attempts"" and being ""saved"" clearly fits this definition.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""All I want is courage to end it"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""It's over. All I want is courage to end it.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? No.
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No, the phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" indicates a desire for the ability to act, rather than an immediate statement of intent or an imminent plan.

- It expresses a clear suicidal thought/desire without providing any specific plan, method, or indication of immediate action or preparation. The phrase ""All I want is courage to end it"" signifies a wish for the ability to act, rather than an imminent plan or action itself. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

*   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm**: ""I'm going out,"" ""I'm going out of this world,"" ""I'm offing myself,"" ""Goodbye world."" These are explicit and strong implications of suicidal intent.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""I'm not worth living"" indicates hopelessness and self-devaluation.
*   **Specific plans/methods/preparations**: The post specifies a very precise date and time: ""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours."" This detailed timing constitutes a specific plan for the action, even if a physical method isn't elaborated beyond ""offing myself."" The phrase ""I'm offing myself then"" ties the intent directly to this specific time.
*   **References to past attempts**: None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""I'm offing myself"" is explicit. ""I'm going out of this world"" and ""Goodbye world"" are strong implications.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I'm not worth living.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? ""Offing myself"" is the method. Crucially, a highly specific *time and date* is provided: ""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours."" This level of detail for *when* the action will occur constitutes a concrete plan.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? The precise date and time indicate a firm, imminent plan.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes, the specific date and time (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours"") strongly suggests imminent intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This refers to a clear, future intention: ""I'm going out... I'm offing myself then.""
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""I'm offing myself,"" ""I'm not worth living""). It goes beyond mere ideation by providing a highly specific date and time for the intended action (""April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours""). This specific timing functions as a concrete plan, indicating strong, imminent intent. It does not describe a past attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states ""I dont want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefuly,"" and ""I want to kill myself so bad."" It also includes phrases like ""Im done,"" ""I cant take it anymore,"" and ""It will never be better,"" which strongly imply a desire to end suffering and life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Severe hopelessness (""It will never be better""), despair, anger (""I hate this world,"" ""I fucking hate women""), loneliness, and feelings of inadequacy (""never good enough,"" ""always lacked something,"" ""feel like piece of shit"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump off a bridge""), methods, or preparations (e.g., ""I wrote a note"") are mentioned. The desire to ""die peacefully"" describes the *manner* of death desired, not a concrete plan or method.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No past attempts are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes.** ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""I dont want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefuly.""

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? **No.**
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No.**
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The post expresses strong current desire (""I want to kill myself so bad"") and hopelessness (""It will never be better""), but it does not specify an imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") that would push it into the 'Behavior' category without a method.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? **Current/Future intentions.** The post expresses current feelings and future desires (""I want to kill myself so bad"").
    *   Are past attempts described? **No.**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post contains explicit and strong expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""I dont want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefuly"").
    *   However, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, or an indication of imminent action.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions. It is beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicidal intent, but does not reach 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan/method/preparation/imminent timing, nor 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" is a strong implication of wanting to not be alive. ""I have to make it stop"" in the context of ""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause"" implies ending their own existence or the pain by ending their life.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""I just can't do this anymore,"" ""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause"" indicates severe distress, hopelessness, and self-blame.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, strongly implied. ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" and ""I have to make it stop"" (in context) strongly convey a desire to end their life.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation.' The post shows severe distress with clear implied intent.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' While ""I have to make it stop"" conveys urgency, it doesn't specify *how* or *when* in a way that indicates imminent *action* without a method. It's more about the strong desire to end suffering.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current/future intentions.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains strongly implied suicidal thoughts (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me,"" ""I have to make it stop"") and significant emotional distress. However, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, or clear imminent timing for an action. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation', which covers explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions. It goes beyond 'Indicator' because of the strong implication of suicidal intent, but does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly uses ""suicide attempt,"" ""suicidal stuff,"" and ""intention of dying."" It also refers to ""point of no return.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** The user expresses struggling to categorize these events, being ""genuinely bothered,"" and the question ""weighing on me a little bit.""
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post mentions ""testing my method"" and describes going ""until shortly before the point of no return."" While the specific method isn't named, the *action* of testing and going to a critical point implies a method was in use.
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** The core of the post describes two past events where the user ""went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped"" and ""stopped myself"" with the ""intention of dying."" These are clear descriptions of incomplete or self-interrupted actions with suicidal intent.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""suicide attempt,"" ""suicidal stuff,"" ""intention of dying.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""intention of dying.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Not by name, but the actions ""testing my method"" and ""went until shortly before the point of no return"" imply a method was present and used.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped,"" ""stopped myself."" These are concrete actions taken.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, the events ""happened long enough ago.""

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post clearly refers to ""two events"" that ""happened long enough ago."" The user states they are ""in a tenuously better situation right now.""
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, the descriptions ""I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped"" and ""Much like the first time I stopped myself"" with the ""intention of dying"" directly align with the definition of incomplete or self-interrupted suicide attempts.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post describes past actions taken with suicidal intent that were interrupted or incomplete. The definition for 'Attempt' specifically includes ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions (e.g., 'I tried to hang myself but stopped'). A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent."" The user's descriptions perfectly fit this criteria for both described events, especially the second one where the intent was to die.

270,"Why exactly should I even have hope anymore? Its evident from my entire life up until now that I was never meant to be happy. I have to learn to not get my hopes up or get excited over shit. Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) and passive thoughts (Ideation). It explicitly mentions ""contemplating suicide"" and ""looking up how to do it,"" which indicates research or preparation. Furthermore, it names specific methods (""jump in front of a car,"" ""stab myself"") that the user wishes they had the courage to carry out. This combination of explicit suicidal thoughts, specific methods, and preparatory actions (""looking up how to do it"") aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', which bridges thoughts and actions. It does not describe a completed or interrupted past attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'.

    *   **Mentions of death/suicide**: ""It will all be done after I die,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I'm just going to pull the trigger."" These are explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""so much pressure.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post states, ""I hurt myself two months ago,"" indicating past self-harm. Crucially, it concludes with, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free,"" which is a strong implication of wanting to end one's life as an escape.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses severe distress, feelings of being uncared for (""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""It's like she doesn't care""), physical and emotional pain (""I hurt myself,"" ""couldn't hide my pain,"" ""tired all the time""), and hopelessness (""tired of putting a mask on"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions ""I hurt myself two months ago,"" describing visible ""wounds."" This is a description of past self-harm. However, it does not explicitly state that this self-harm was an *attempt* to die. The definition of 'Attempt' requires a ""concrete action... initiated with suicidal intent."" The phrasing here does not confirm suicidal intent for that past action, distinguishing it from a suicide attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" strongly implies a desire for death as a release, which falls under suicidal ideation.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" is a clear implied expression of wanting to die.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The emotional context is severe distress, and the implied intent is clear.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"") is a past event. The statement ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" refers to a current feeling and desire.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? The self-harm is described, but it is not framed as a suicide attempt. It's ""I hurt myself,"" not ""I tried to kill myself.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** The post goes beyond general distress. The phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" clearly indicates a desire for death, which is more than just vague references or severe hopelessness.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits well. The post includes a strongly implied suicidal thought/feeling (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"") without specific plans or actions related to suicide. The past self-harm is noted but not presented as a suicide attempt.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires a specific plan/method, preparations/actions taken (with suicidal intent), or strong intent with imminent timing. None of these are present regarding *suicide*.
    *   **Attempt:** While past self-harm is mentioned, it is not described as a suicide attempt (i.e., initiated with suicidal intent to end one's life). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

Based on the strong implication of wanting to die (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"") without any concrete plans or actions related to suicide, the post best fits the 'Ideation' category.

    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly goes beyond 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal thoughts and the mention of ""detailed plans.""
    *   It also goes beyond 'Ideation'. While it contains strong suicidal thoughts, the definition of 'Ideation' specifies ""without specific plans or actions."" The phrase ""I write detailed plans in my journal"" indicates the formulation and documentation of a specific plan, which moves it into the 'Behavior' category.
    *   The 'Behavior' category includes ""explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts plus either: (1) a specific plan or method... or (2) preparations or actions taken."" The user explicitly states they have ""detailed plans"" and are ""writing"" them, which fits both criteria (1) and (2) as the creation of a specific plan and a preparatory action.
    *   It is not 'Attempt' as no past action with suicidal intent is described.
    *   Despite the user stating a barrier (""I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did""), the *existence* of detailed, written plans is the defining factor that classifies it as 'Behavior' according to the provided definitions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm:** No explicit mentions. The phrase ""I can't take it anymore"" implies extreme distress and a feeling of being overwhelmed, but not a direct desire to end life.

    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied?** No explicit mention. ""I can't take it anymore"" is a strong expression of distress and a feeling of being at one's limit, but it does not *strongly imply* suicidal intent over general severe emotional distress or a cry for help. It lacks the directness of ""I want to die"" or ""I'm going to die soon.""
    *   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No direct expression. The implication is a desire for the pain to stop, but not necessarily a desire to die.
    *   **If unclear, consider emotional context:** Severe distress is evident, but the *implied intent* does not clearly point to suicide. It could be interpreted as extreme emotional exhaustion.

    *   **Attempt:** No past attempt described.
    *   **Behavior:** No specific plan, method, preparations, or imminent timing with suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** The post does not include explicit or *strongly implied* suicidal thoughts or feelings. While there is severe distress, the phrasing ""I can't take it anymore"" does not equate to ""I want to die"" or ""I'm going to die soon."" It expresses being overwhelmed by pain, which is distinct from expressing suicidal intent.
    *   **Indicator:** The post shows general distress and severe pain (""I can't take it anymore. The pain is unreal"") but *lacks explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent*. It fits the definition of showing general distress without a clear desire to die, and severe hopelessness alone is not enough to move it beyond this category.

It is not 'Indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not 'Behavior' because there's no plan, action, or imminent timing. It is not 'Attempt' because it does not describe a past action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrases ""Don't want tot. Do this anymore,"" ""I just want tit to be over,"" and ""I wasn't to be down"" (likely a typo for ""I want to be done"" or ""I want to be dead"") strongly imply a desire to end one's life or existence.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit,"" ""I don't want to be alone any more,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" ""I'm sick and tired,"" and ""Please please please"" convey severe distress, self-loathing, loneliness, hopelessness, and a desperate plea for relief.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, strongly implied through ""I just want tit to be over"" and ""I wasn't to be down.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want tit to be over.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The emotional context is one of severe distress and a clear desire for an end to suffering, which strongly supports implied suicidal intent.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No specific timing is mentioned, only a general desire for it to be over.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current feelings and intentions (""I just want tit to be over"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses a strong desire to end one's life (""I just want tit to be over,"" ""I wasn't to be down"") and severe emotional distress, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, or imminent timing, which would classify it as 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" and ""I will use my suicide."" This directly mentions suicide and implies a desire to end one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""I hate capitalism and everyone complicit in it"" indicates strong negative emotions, but the core of the post is suicidal.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method or preparation for a *current* or *imminent* action is mentioned, but there is a stated *intent* for a future action (""I will use my suicide"").
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post explicitly states, ""I have attempted suicide 11 times.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""attempted suicide"" and ""my suicide.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""I will use my suicide"" implies a desire to die.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No, not for a *new* attempt.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The phrase ""I will use my suicide"" suggests future intent, but not necessarily *imminent* timing (e.g., ""tonight"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" (past events) and ""I will use my suicide"" (future intention).
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" clearly describes multiple past attempts.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post explicitly describes *past suicide attempts* (""I have attempted suicide 11 times"").
    *   The definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear.""
    *   Since a past attempt is clearly described, regardless of the additional mention of future intent, the primary classification should be 'Attempt'.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")?

*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? Yes, ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" clearly describes past attempts.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the most fitting category is 'Attempt'. The post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now""). According to the definition, ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions."" The rule also states: ""If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" While there is clear current ideation (""I just want the pain to end""), the explicit mention of past attempts takes precedence for classification into the 'Attempt' category.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes. The post explicitly states, ""All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying 'don't kill yourself' does something in itself."" It also says, ""I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death."" The post then details specific methods: ""I don't want my head to explode via shotgun,"" and discusses ""shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth"" with considerations of ""small caliber or large caliber."" It references ""Mark Linkous overdosing"" and the fear of ""A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again."" The post concludes with ""End it now.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Yes. ""I am in hell,"" ""I'm so alone,"" ""painful feeling of inability to connect,"" ""sadder,"" ""terribly scared,"" ""depression and physical pain,"" ""high anxiety."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes. The post details specific methods: shotgun, handgun (shooting through the mouth, with caliber considerations). It also states, ""I've looked into other options,"" indicating research and contemplation of methods, which constitutes a form of preparation.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No, not by the author. The reference to Mark Linkous is an external example of a failed attempt, used to illustrate the author's fear of a similar outcome.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes. ""don't kill yourself,"" ""accomplish death,"" and extensive discussion of suicide methods.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. The entire discussion of methods, the fear of a failed attempt, and the concluding ""End it now"" strongly imply a desire to die, despite the fear of the *process* of dying.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is very clear and goes beyond simple ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. Shotgun, handgun (shooting through the upper palate in the mouth), and general ""other options"" including overdose (mentioned in the context of fear of failure).
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes. The statement ""I've looked into other options"" indicates active research and contemplation of methods, which is a form of preparation. The detailed consideration of specific methods (caliber, outcome of shotgun vs. handgun) suggests a concrete thought process towards action.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No explicit imminent timing. However, the detailed discussion of specific methods and the phrase ""End it now"" (even if generalized) indicates a strong, active consideration of taking action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current/future intentions. The discussion revolves around *how* to accomplish death, not a past action by the author.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No, not by the author.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    Based on the analysis, the post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) because it includes explicit discussions of specific suicide methods (shotgun, handgun to the mouth) and indicates active research/contemplation of these methods (""I've looked into other options""). This level of detail and consideration of *how* to die, even with fear of the process, fits the definition of 'Behavior' as it includes ""a specific plan or method"" and ""preparations or actions taken"" (research/contemplation of methods). It does not describe a past attempt by the author, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) by explicitly stating ""I have a plan"" and detailing knowledge of the ""where,"" ""how,"" and ""what I need"" for an attempt. This presence of a specific plan, even without explicit details of the method, and implied preparations (""what I need"") aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'. It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'. It clearly shows suicidal intent and a plan, so it's not 'Indicator'.

Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now.

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? **Yes.** ""ideations of suicide"" is explicit.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? **No.**
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No.**
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The post describes a chronic state (""Everyday I feel like..."", ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive""), not an imminent action. The comfort found in ""ideations of suicide"" suggests a mental state, not a concrete step towards action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to current and ongoing feelings and intentions (""these days,"" ""Everyday,"" ""Most days"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? **No.**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out because there are explicit mentions of suicidal ideation and strong desires to not be alive, going beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** This category fits perfectly. The post explicitly mentions ""ideations of suicide"" and expresses a clear desire to not be alive (""I wish I wasn't alive,"" ""battling to stay alive,"" ""world would be better off without me"") without detailing any specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
    *   **Behavior:** Ruled out because there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or strong imminent intent tied to an action. The comfort is found *in the ideations*, not in taking steps towards an action.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out because no past suicide attempt is described.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly states ""thinking about killing myself,"" which indicates suicidal thoughts. However, it does not describe any specific plans, methods, preparations, or actions taken towards an attempt. It also does not describe a past attempt. This aligns precisely with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions."" It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) by explicitly mentioning suicide, but falls short of concrete steps or imminent intent (Behavior) or a past action (Attempt).

CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: The post states, ""I want the constant anxiety and sadness of my pointless situation to stop by crashing into another car"" and expresses fear ""that I won't die on impact."" This clearly indicates a desire to die as a means to end suffering.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""constant anxiety and sadness,"" ""pointless situation."" These indicate severe distress and hopelessness.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: A specific method is mentioned: ""crashing into another car."" The phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" suggests a recurring impulse or near-action towards this specific plan.
*   **References to past attempts**: The post explicitly states ""never can"" after ""frequently come close to doing it,"" meaning no actual attempt was initiated.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, strongly implied through the desire to ""stop"" pain by ""crashing into another car"" with the intent to die.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the desire to die by crashing to end anxiety and sadness.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: Not unclear; strong implied intent.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""crashing into another car.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates a recurring, strong impulse or near-action towards the specific method, bridging thoughts and actions. It's not a preparation in the sense of gathering tools, but it's a recurring proximity to initiating the act.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? ""frequently come close to doing it"" implies a strong, recurring urge to act on the plan, indicating a high level of risk and inclination towards the behavior.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""frequently come close to doing it"" refers to recurring near-actions, indicating a current and ongoing strong impulse towards future action.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No, the post states ""never can,"" explicitly ruling out an initiated attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent and a specific method.
*   **Ideation**: Ruled out because there is a specific method (""crashing into another car"") and the phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" indicates a recurring impulse or near-action that goes beyond mere thoughts.
*   **Behavior**: This category fits best. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (wanting to die to stop pain) and a specific method (""crashing into another car""). The phrase ""frequently come close to doing it"" signifies a strong, recurring intent and proximity to action, bridging thoughts and actions, even if the final step hasn't been taken. This demonstrates a higher level of risk than pure ideation.
*   **Attempt**: Ruled out because the post explicitly states ""never can,"" meaning no action was initiated.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains an explicit statement of suicidal intent (""I'm going to kill myself""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'. However, it does not describe a specific plan, method, preparations, or an imminent timeframe (like ""tonight"" or ""now"") that would classify it as 'Behavior'. It also does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category, which covers explicit suicidal thoughts or feelings without concrete plans or actions.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I've decided to stop eating,"" ""I hope my body breaks down"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) by clearly stating a specific plan/method (""starve myself"") and a decision to act upon it (""I've decided to stop eating all together""). While the initial statement about being ""too much of a pussy to kill myself"" might suggest a barrier to *other* methods, it is immediately followed by the articulation of a *different*, specific, and chosen method for ending life. This falls under the 'Behavior' category because it includes explicit suicidal intent coupled with a specific plan and an action/decision taken to implement that plan. It is not an 'Attempt' as it describes the initiation of a slow process, not a past, concrete, interrupted action.

This is highly specific and describes actions taken.
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones**: The phrase ""I just slit my wrists"" describes a concrete action initiated with suicidal intent that has *just* occurred.

These are descriptions of actions taken.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Not applicable, as a method and action are clearly described as having occurred.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? **Past/Current action.** ""I just slit my wrists."" ""If you are seeing this then its already too late."" This describes an action that has just occurred or is in the process of occurring, indicating an initiated attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly describes a concrete action that has been initiated with suicidal intent (""I just slit my wrists,"" ""Took my dremel and put the saw attachment on and followed the lines""). The temporal context (""I just slit my wrists,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late"") confirms that an action has been taken. This fits the definition of 'Attempt' which states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent.""

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself.

*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No, for the poster.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself,"" indicating clear suicidal thoughts and feelings. However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or a sense of imminent action. The conditional nature (""If I become worse..."") places it firmly in the realm of thoughts rather than concrete steps or immediate intent. It does not describe a past attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""I wanted to die when i made that post."" It also expresses extreme hopelessness (""I have no hope,"" ""everything always seems like a gamble,"" ""meaningless torture,"" ""how to go on when you can't""). While there's a contradictory phrase ""I just don't want to die,"" this often signifies a desire *not* to feel suicidal, rather than an absence of suicidal thoughts. The clear statement ""I wanted to die"" indicates suicidal ideation.

    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No. The action described is drafting a message for help, not preparing for suicide.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? No. The statement ""I wanted to die when i made that post"" refers to a past feeling/state, not an immediate, ongoing intent to act *now*. The current state is one of despair and inability to reach out.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""I wanted to die when i made that post"" refers to a past feeling. However, the post also states ""even before and now after that, i have no hope,"" indicating current and ongoing hopelessness and despair. The overall context is a person struggling with suicidal thoughts and feelings, seeking help, but feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. There is no description of a completed or interrupted *attempt*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. The post explicitly states ""I wanted to die,"" which goes beyond general distress or vague references to death.
    *   **Ideation:** Fits best. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I wanted to die"") and strong expressions of hopelessness and despair, but it does not describe a specific plan, method, preparations, or an actual attempt. The internal conflict and plea for help are consistent with ideation.

The post contains explicit statements of suicidal intent (""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point,"" ""I'm ready to say goodbye""). However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or descriptions of actions taken.

The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself,"" ""I'm done""). It moves beyond mere ideation by stating ""I could do it right now,"" which indicates a strong, present capability and contemplation of immediate action, even if fear is a barrier.

The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I'm better off dead"") and significant emotional distress (""Can't stand this anymore""). However, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, or strong imminent timing that would classify it as 'Behavior'. It is more than general distress, ruling out 'Indicator'.

The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""wanting to die""). Crucially, it describes a concrete preparatory action: ""i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine."" This moves the post beyond mere ideation into the realm of 'Behavior', which is defined as including explicit suicidal thoughts *plus* ""preparations or actions taken."" While administrative thoughts are a current deterrent to the final act, the significant preparation has already occurred.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: ""I've never been more suicidal in my life."" - This is an explicit mention of suicidal feelings.
    *   Emotional indicators: Guilt (""I fucked up""), shame (""One of my friends thought I was stalking""), distress (""got in trouble with my family"").
    *   Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
    *   References to past attempts: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes**, ""I've never been more suicidal in my life.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes**, ""suicidal"" directly expresses this.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? **No**.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No**.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? **No**. While the statement ""never been more suicidal"" indicates a high level of distress and suicidal thoughts, it does not specify an imminent intent to act or a timeframe for such action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""I've never been more suicidal in my life"" refers to a current, intense feeling of suicidal ideation, triggered by past events.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? **No**.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   **Indicator**: Ruled out because there is an explicit mention of being ""suicidal,"" indicating clear suicidal intent beyond general distress.
    *   **Ideation**: The post explicitly states ""I've never been more suicidal in my life,"" indicating strong suicidal thoughts and feelings. However, it lacks any mention of specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent to act. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.
    *   **Behavior**: Ruled out because there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or strong intent with imminent timing (e.g., ""I'm going to do it tonight"").
    *   **Attempt**: Ruled out because there is no description of a past suicide attempt.

This country is a prison colony and it appears to be testing grounds to removing the flaws and imperfections in the human race and turning men into women.It's what hitler devised that he wanted to remove the flaws and imperfections and  wanted to purify the human race. We are all slaves to a fascist regime  that treats people as a number but we like to pretend that we live in a democracy to give us the illusion of freedom when there is no freedom. We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
- Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life: No. The post uses historical and political metaphors (Auschwitz, Hitler, fascist regime) to express anger and despair about societal control, but these are not related to the poster's personal desire to die or end their life.
- Emotional indicators: Yes, strong anger, paranoia, and a sense of oppression/hopelessness regarding the state of society. However, these emotions are directed outwards at perceived societal issues, not inwards as suicidal intent.
- Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No.
- References to past attempts: No.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No. The post is a political/social commentary, not a personal expression of suicidal thoughts.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses a desire for freedom and resistance against perceived control, not a desire for personal demise.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? No.
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent? No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a current perceived societal situation, but no past or future suicidal intentions.
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post expresses severe distress and a bleak, conspiratorial view of society, using strong negative language. However, it completely lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent, desire to die, plans, or references to past attempts on the part of the individual writing the post. The distress is related to external societal conditions, not internal suicidal ideation. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it shows general distress without suicidal intent.

- Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or strong implications: ""Heaven seems really good right now,"" ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus."" This explicitly states a desire to die.
- Emotional indicators: ""hurts so much,"" ""feel so alone,"" ""terrifying,"" ""dislike or are indifferent,"" ""family doesn't love me,"" ""friends just put up with me,"" ""mocked."" These indicate severe emotional distress, loneliness, and hopelessness.
- Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
- If unclear, consider emotional context: N/A, intent is clear.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
- Are specific methods mentioned? No.
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? No, while the desire is strong, there's no mention of immediate timing like ""tonight"" or ""now"" that would suggest imminent action without a method.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intentions/desires.
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus""). However, it does not mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, actions taken, or imminent timing that would elevate it to the 'Behavior' category. It clearly goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because of the explicit desire to die. It does not describe a past action (Attempt). Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings without concrete steps.

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' The phrase ""right now i'm considering suicide"" indicates current ideation, but not an imminent *action* or a specific plan.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly states ""I'm considering suicide,"" which clearly indicates suicidal thoughts or feelings. However, it does not mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, or actions taken. It also does not describe a past attempt. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly, as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or actions. It goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of considering suicide. It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' as there's no specific plan, action, or strong imminent intent for an action. It does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.

I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone.

The core of the post is a logical argument for why the user believes ending their life is the correct decision.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user describes ""anger issues"" that have ""caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members,"" and mentions ""emotional pain."" There's a clear sense of despair and hopelessness regarding their impact on others and their own future.

The act of masturbating is described as a coping mechanism in response to distress and suicidal thoughts, not as a suicidal action itself. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' which involves explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete plans or actions.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

    *   ""A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out."" - Describes a past self-harm action.
    *   ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" - Strong implication of questioning the value of life, indicating suicidal thoughts.
    *   ""Btw theres about a dozen scars."" - Physical evidence of past self-harm.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of all the people,"" ""in pain,"" ""numb and empty inside,"" ""cried myself to sleep."" - High levels of distress, hopelessness, and invalidation.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned for current intent.
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** The post describes a past self-harm incident. However, it states the action was ""to try to relieve some of the pain,"" not explicitly ""to die."" While self-harm can be a suicide attempt, the definition of 'Attempt' requires ""suicidal intent,"" which is not explicitly stated for this past action.

**2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is a strong implication of suicidal thoughts.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" implies a desire not to continue living in the current state.

**3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for current intent.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No, not for current intent. The past action described is self-harm, but not explicitly a *suicide* attempt as per the definition's requirement for ""suicidal intent.""

**4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
    *   Past events: The self-harm incident ""A few months ago"" and ""I've had issues with self harm in the past.""
    *   Current intentions: ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" refers to a current state of questioning life's value.
*   Are past attempts described? A past self-harm action is described, but the suicidal intent for that action is not explicitly stated, making it ambiguous whether it qualifies as a ""suicide attempt"" under the given definition.

**5. CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses current suicidal thoughts/feelings (""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"") without mentioning any specific plans or actions for current intent. While there's a history of self-harm, the past incident described doesn't explicitly state suicidal intent, only ""to relieve some of the pain."" Therefore, it doesn't definitively meet the criteria for 'Attempt' (which requires ""suicidal intent"" for the past action). The current statement ""Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions."" It is more severe than 'Indicator' as it moves beyond general distress to questioning life's worth. It does not meet 'Behavior' as there are no current plans or actions.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the presence of ""suicidal thoughts"" implies a desire to die, even if the user is seeking to mitigate it.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The explicit mention of ""suicidal ideation"" makes it clear this is beyond an 'indicator'.

*   **Specific plans/methods/preparations**: ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily."" While not explicitly stated as *the* suicide method, it's presented as an ongoing self-destructive action in the context of wanting to die soon. There are no other explicit preparations like writing a note or gathering specific tools for a direct suicide act.
*   **References to past attempts**: No past suicide attempts are mentioned. The reference to taking an antipsychotic in the past describes a negative reaction to medication, not a suicide attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? The daily heroin use is an ongoing self-destructive behavior presented in conjunction with the desire to die. It can be interpreted as an action taken that the user hopes leads to death, even if not a definitive, planned suicide method.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily"" is an ongoing action.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? ""Soon I will be finally dead"" combined with the impending forced institutionalization within 4 weeks suggests a strong, time-sensitive intent to avoid that future.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
It includes an ongoing self-destructive action (""I have started to do heroin pretty much daily"") that is presented in the context of wanting to die. This can be considered an ""action taken"" or a ""method"" in the broader sense of self-destruction leading to desired death.
Furthermore, the phrase ""Soon I will be finally dead,"" especially in the context of the impending forced institutionalization, conveys strong intent with a sense of urgency, fitting the ""imminent timing"" aspect of the 'Behavior' definition. The user's extreme aversion to the institution and medication acts as a strong motivator for this imminent intent.
Therefore, the combination of explicit suicidal thoughts, an ongoing self-destructive action, and strong, time-sensitive intent aligns best with the 'Behavior' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post asks ""What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem."" This is a direct inquiry about a method to cause death, specifically targeting a vital part of the brain, which is a strong implication of wanting to end one's life. The dismissal of common reasons to live (""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you... I genuinely do not care for any of those things"") further reinforces this intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The dismissal of family and future suggests deep despair, detachment, and a strong, resolute intent to die.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A ""gun"" is explicitly mentioned as the method. The question about the ""position... for hitting the brain stem"" indicates a specific *plan* or *research* related to the method to ensure lethality.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, strongly implied through the detailed inquiry about the most effective way to use a gun to cause death.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the entire context, particularly the dismissal of reasons to live, implies a strong desire to die.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: The intent is very clear and strong.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, a ""gun.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Asking about the ""best position"" for a gun to hit the brain stem is a form of *planning* or *research* related to executing the act. It's not just a vague thought; it's a detailed inquiry about a lethal method's application.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? While not explicitly stating ""tonight,"" the detailed nature of the question about method application suggests a high level of intent and consideration of immediate action, moving beyond mere ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions. The question is about *how* to do it, implying a present or future intent.
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond mere ""Ideation"" because it not only expresses a strong desire to die (implied by the dismissal of life's value and the nature of the question) but also includes a specific method (gun) and a detailed inquiry about its effective application (""position... for hitting the brain stem""). This constitutes a specific plan or preparation, fitting the definition of ""Behavior."" It is not an ""Attempt"" as no past action is described. It is far more specific and urgent than an ""Indicator.""

- The post explicitly states ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself."" This is a direct mention of suicidal thoughts and intent.
- ""it wont leave my head"" emphasizes the persistence of these thoughts.
- ""everything just keeps getting worse"" indicates severe distress and hopelessness.
- ""my mum saw my self harm scars and got angry at me"" mentions past self-harm, which is a risk factor and an indicator of distress, but not a description of a suicide attempt in this context.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""killing myself"" is explicitly mentioned.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the persistent thought of ""killing myself"" is a direct expression.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? No.
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No. The self-harm scars refer to past non-lethal self-harm, not current preparation for suicide or an initiated suicide attempt.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, it describes persistent, ongoing thoughts (""every single day"") rather than immediate plans or actions.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to ongoing, persistent current thoughts (""hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself"").
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No. While self-harm scars are mentioned, the post does not describe an initiated suicide attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
Based on the analysis, the post explicitly states persistent suicidal thoughts (""thought about killing myself"") without detailing a specific plan, method, preparation, or an initiated attempt. This fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because of the explicit suicidal intent, but does not include a plan/action (Behavior) or a past attempt (Attempt).

This aligns with the 'Behavior' definition, which includes ""strong intent with imminent timing even without a method.""

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly describes multiple past suicide attempts (""I've tried to overdose three times,"" ""my first attempt""). While it also expresses strong, imminent future intent, the definition for 'Attempt' states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" Since past attempts are explicitly and clearly described, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate classification.

    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post goes beyond general distress or vague references to death (Indicator) because ""I just want this pain to end"" strongly implies a desire for cessation of existence to escape suffering.
    *   It does not include specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing (Behavior).
    *   It does not describe a past suicide attempt (Attempt).
    *   It clearly includes strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings (""I just want this pain to end,"" implying a desire to die to stop the pain) without any concrete steps or plans. This aligns perfectly with the definition of Ideation.

*   **Mentions of death/suicide**: Explicitly states ""I'm suicidal"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go."" Implies wanting to end life with ""don't think I'll make it past this summer.""
*   **Emotional indicators**: Despair, hopelessness, likely intensified by the mother's dismissive reaction (""smirked and rolled her eyes"").

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The phrase ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" indicates a timeframe but not immediate, imminent intent (like ""tonight"" or ""now"") that would push it to 'Behavior' without a method. ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"" is a strong statement of intent, but still lacks the specifics of a plan or action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm suicidal,"" ""don't think I'll make it past this summer,"" ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"").

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains explicit and strong expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""I'm suicidal,"" ""don't think I'll make it past this summer,"" ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go""). However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, actions taken, or truly imminent timing (like ""tonight"" or ""now"" without a method). It also does not describe a past attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

327,"It's over for me. I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry. I'm so sorry. There is no putting me back together. Im broken. I'm damaged. I'm all fucked up. I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work. I promise I wont fail this time. I'm gonna buy the right stuff. Say my goodbyes to the one I love. Gonna be gone after this weekend. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.",2,behavior,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Key elements**: The post explicitly states, ""I'm planning on killing myself at 30 or 25."" It expresses a desire for life to end (""this life for me isn't it"") and offers pre-emptive apologies.
    *   **Emotional indicators**: Feelings of despair (""I don't know what's wrong with me,"" ""It's not worth it"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, gathering items) are mentioned. The ""plan"" is a very distant, conditional timeline (""at 30 or 25,"" ""innnn 8 yrs or so"").
    *   **References to past attempts**: None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""I'm planning on killing myself.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""this life for me isn't it,"" ""Adios i can't. It's not worth it.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, the intent is explicitly set for a distant future (8+ years from now) and is conditional (""But if i still feel the same or worse by the time im around that age""). This lack of imminence is crucial.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Future intentions, but very distant and conditional.
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   **Indicator**: This is too strong for Indicator, as there is explicit suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation**: The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I'm planning on killing myself"") and expressions of wanting to die (""this life for me isn't it""). However, it lacks specific methods, preparations, or *imminent* intent. The ""plan"" is a distant, conditional thought process rather than a concrete, actionable plan for the present or near future. This aligns with the Ideation definition: ""includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions. This ranges from passive thoughts... to stronger desires to end life, but stops short of concrete steps."" The distant, conditional nature of the ""plan"" keeps it within Ideation.
    *   **Behavior**: This category requires a specific plan/method, preparations/actions taken, or strong intent with *imminent timing*. None of these are present. The ""planning"" is too vague and far in the future to constitute a ""behavior"" or a concrete, actionable plan.
    *   **Attempt**: No past attempt is described.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post mentions ""suicide rate"" and ""teetering on the edge."" The latter implies being close to a breaking point or a dangerous situation.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""Teetering on the edge lately"" suggests significant distress or being at a critical point. The context is about the difficulties of being a queer person perceived as male and a threat.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
*   **References to past attempts:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""suicide rate"" is explicitly mentioned. ""Teetering on the edge"" implies severe distress, but it doesn't explicitly state the poster's *own* suicidal intent or desire to die. It's more of a general statement about their current difficult state.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post does not contain direct or strongly implied expressions of the poster's personal desire to die. It discusses the suicide rate in a broader context and expresses empathy for others, rather than stating personal suicidal ideation.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: The emotional context is distress (""teetering on the edge"") and empathy/understanding of a societal issue (""Now I know why the suicide rate...""). This doesn't translate to explicit personal suicidal intent.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""Been teetering on the edge lately"" refers to a current or recent ongoing state of distress. There are no mentions of past attempts or current/future suicidal plans.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post describes general distress (""teetering on the edge"") and mentions ""suicide rate"" in a reflective, empathetic context regarding societal pressures. However, it lacks explicit or strongly implied expressions of the poster's *own* suicidal intent or desire to die. There are no plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts. This aligns best with the 'Indicator' definition, which allows for general distress or vague references to death without a clear desire to die.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""within 24 hours"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly mentions suicide and strongly implies suicidal intent (""gone within 24 hours""). While no specific method is stated, the phrase ""within 24 hours"" clearly indicates *imminent timing* with a strong desire to end life. This aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', which includes ""strong intent with imminent timing (e.g., 'I want to be gone tonight') even without a method."" It goes beyond mere ideation by specifying a timeframe for the intent.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post uses the phrase ""it's killing me,"" which is an idiomatic expression of extreme distress, not a literal statement of suicidal intent. There are no other mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm, nor any strong implications of wanting to end one's life (e.g., ""I want to be gone,"" ""I’m going to die soon"").
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses profound distress, feelings of abuse, manipulation, helplessness, self-hatred (""I hate myself for letting them do that""), and being trapped.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? No. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is metaphorical for severe emotional pain.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' While there is severe distress, there is no implied intent to die. The post focuses on the desire to escape the abuse and gain legal protection.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The post describes ongoing abuse and current feelings, but no past or current suicidal actions or intentions.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly conveys severe distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being trapped due to ongoing abuse. However, it lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is an idiomatic expression of extreme emotional pain, not a literal desire to die. The primary focus of the post is the abuse, the inability to escape, and the desire for a restraining order. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator', which describes general distress or vague references to death without a clear desire to die, and states that severe hopelessness alone isn't enough to move beyond this category unless suicidal intent is explicit or strongly implied.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly mentions ""self harm"" multiple times, describing current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now""). It also explicitly states ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time,"" which are direct expressions of suicidal intent and a desire to end life.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys significant distress, frustration, and hopelessness (""every little problem, every panic attack,"" ""What the hell makes them think this won't end badly"").
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific *suicide* method is detailed (e.g., specific pills, location). However, the post describes current actions of self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") and expresses a strong, imminent intent to die (""I should do it now and save time"").
*   **References to past attempts:** The post describes a relapse into *self-harm* after four months, not a past suicide *attempt*.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, the post describes current self-harm (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") which is an action.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? Yes. ""I should do it now and save time."" strongly suggests imminent intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No past *suicide attempts* are described, only a relapse into self-harm.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) and mere thoughts (Ideation) because it includes explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself,"" ""I should do it now"") combined with current self-harming actions (""I'm bloodying myself up now"") and a strong sense of imminent timing (""I should do it now and save time""). It does not describe a *past* suicide attempt, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. The combination of explicit suicidal thoughts, current actions (self-harm), and imminent intent aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'.

*   There is no mention of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
*   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
- **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, the post explicitly states ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and describes taking a large quantity of pills with the hope of not waking up, indicating a strong desire to end life.
- **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with indicators of severe despair, hopelessness, self-loathing, and shame (""Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure,"" ""I can't stand the person looking back at me,"" ""I despise myself even more"").
- **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** Yes, a specific method and action are described: ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers.""
- **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** Yes, the post clearly states ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and then details one of these attempts: ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again."" This describes an initiated action with suicidal intent that was not fatal.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes. The phrase ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" strongly implies suicidal actions, and ""I want to die"" is explicit. The description of taking pills hoping not to wake up is also a strong implication of suicidal intent.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
- Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers.""
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, the post describes the action of *taking* the pills.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' The post describes an action that *already occurred* with imminent intent (""hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning"").

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
- Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The post describes past events. ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and ""Yesterday I took... I honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again"" clearly refer to completed, albeit unsuccessful, actions in the past. While there is current ideation (""I want to die""), the primary and most severe element is the description of past attempts.
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? Yes. The post explicitly states ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and provides details of one such attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes past suicide attempts (""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"") and provides a detailed account of a specific, recent attempt (""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning""). This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent.""

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post expresses extreme hopelessness, despair, and a feeling that life is a ""total curse."" It describes a ""horrible life"" and states ""My life sucks."" However, it does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm, nor does it contain strong implications like ""I want to be gone,"" ""I'm going to die soon,"" or ""I wish I weren't here."" The phrase ""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse"" is a general statement about life's unfairness, not a direct expression of personal suicidal intent.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? No.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The post expresses profound dissatisfaction with life and a sense of being cursed, but it does not convey a desire for the author's own life to end.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' While there is severe distress, there is no implied intent to die.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to ongoing and past struggles, and a general state of life. No past attempts are described.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post clearly demonstrates severe distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life. However, it lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent, specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts. The emotional content points to a significant struggle, but without suicidal ideation, it fits the definition of 'Indicator'. Severe hopelessness alone is not sufficient to classify as 'Ideation' without clear suicidal intent.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) because it explicitly mentions ""looking into my options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row,"" which are concrete preparatory actions. While a specific method isn't detailed, these phrases indicate active steps towards enacting a plan. The strong sense of imminent timing (""It could finally be my time"") and the farewell also support this. It does not describe a completed or interrupted past attempt (Attempt). Therefore, it fits the definition of Behavior.

I should be allowed assisted suicide. It's twice as worse to tell me to stay and suffer.",1,ideation,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"" multiple times, refers to being ""constantly suicidal,"" and expresses a desire for ""assisted suicide."" It also implies a desire not to suffer (""It's twice as worse to tell me to stay and suffer"").
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, frustration, and a sense of being trapped or misunderstood regarding mental health and recovery.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump""), or preparations (e.g., ""wrote a note"") are mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes.** (""I want to kill myself,"" ""constantly suicidal,"" ""assisted suicide"").
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes.** (""I want to kill myself,"" ""I should be allowed assisted suicide,"" ""It's twice as worse to tell me to stay and suffer"").

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? **No.**
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No.**
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? **No.** While the desire to die is strong and ongoing (""constantly suicidal""), there is no indication of immediate action or a specific timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""now"" for self-harm. The mention of ""assisted suicide"" is presented as a desired option, not a personal, imminent plan.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current, ongoing suicidal thoughts and feelings (""I want to kill myself,"" ""constantly suicidal"") and a desired future outcome (""I should be allowed assisted suicide"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? **No.**

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post contains explicit and strong expressions of suicidal thoughts and desires (""I want to kill myself,"" ""constantly suicidal""). However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or indications of imminent action. It also does not describe a past suicide attempt. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

344,Gonna end myself soon. Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on,2,behavior,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   Identified mentions of death/suicide: ""Gonna end myself soon."" This is a strong implication of wanting to end one's life.
    *   Noted emotional indicators: Not explicitly stated, but the intent implies severe distress.
    *   Looked for specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on."" This explicitly states a method (OD) and specific means/substances, implying preparation (having them).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""Gonna end myself soon"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""Gonna end myself soon.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""OD on"" using ""1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"" indicates possession of the means for the stated method.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? While ""soon"" isn't immediate, the presence of a specific method and means makes it fall into 'Behavior'.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current/future intentions (""Gonna end myself soon"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""Gonna end myself soon""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   Crucially, it includes a *specific plan/method* (""OD on"") and *specific means* (""1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"") that are stated as being possessed (""Have""). This goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) and enters the realm of concrete planning and preparation.
    *   It does not describe a *past completed or interrupted action*, so it is not 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it best fits the 'Behavior' category, which covers explicit suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan/method or preparations.

All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away.

It also mentions, ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""Lonely,"" ""constantly feeling alone,"" ""don't fit in,"" ""inconvenience,"" ""coward for not going through with it.""
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""a knife to my wrist"" is mentioned as a method used in past actions and imagined in current thoughts.
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** The post explicitly states, ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This describes concrete actions initiated with suicidal intent but not completed.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood"" and ""I feel like I just need to do it"" (in context of ""suicide is never the answer"").
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I feel like I just need to do it.""

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? ""I feel like I just need to do it"" suggests current strong intent, though not explicitly tied to an immediate timeframe like ""tonight.""

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to both. ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life"" refers to past events. ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead..."" and ""I feel like I just need to do it"" refer to current ideation and future intent.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes. ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut"" perfectly fits the definition of describing past, incomplete attempts.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly describes past actions taken with suicidal intent that were not completed (""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut""). This directly aligns with the definition of the 'Attempt' category: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent."" The rule also states, ""If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" Both past attempts and current ideation/intent are present, making 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? While there is intent, the phrase ""before I kill myself"" is conditional on ""feeling loved"" and does not specify imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). It indicates a future intention rather than an immediate, concrete step.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"") and frequent contemplation of methods (""contemplate method over 100 times a day""). However, it does not specify a concrete plan, a particular method, or any actions taken or preparations made. It also does not describe a past attempt. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation', which covers explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions. The frequent contemplation of methods is still within the realm of thought rather than concrete planning or behavior.

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No. In fact, the phrase ""I feel like I'll be here for a long timer"" (likely ""time"") suggests a lack of imminent intent, despite the desire to die.

The phrase ""I feel like I'll be here for a long timer"" even suggests a lack of immediate intent.

    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, ""I was hospitalised for it previously"" indicates a past event where suicidal intent was severe enough to warrant hospitalization, which aligns with the 'Attempt' definition of a concrete action initiated with suicidal intent or a severe crisis.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains strong current suicidal ideation (""I don't see any future,"" ""I will be joining her as well""). However, the crucial element is the clear mention of a past event: ""I was hospitalised for it previously."" Being hospitalized *for suicide* strongly indicates a past suicide attempt or a severe suicidal crisis that necessitated medical intervention due to initiated action or imminent risk. According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent. If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" The past hospitalization for suicide is a clear indication of a past attempt or a severe crisis that falls under this category.

Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy.

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? Yes. The phrase ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" suggests a sense of urgency and limited time before an intended action, fitting the criterion of imminent timing.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses strong implied suicidal thoughts (""tired of living,"" ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it""). It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) and clearly states a desire to end their suffering. While no specific method or plan is given, the phrase ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" conveys a sense of *imminent timing* or urgency, which aligns with the 'Behavior' definition: ""strong intent with imminent timing (e.g., 'I want to be gone tonight') even without a method."" It does not describe a past attempt (Attempt). Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, strongly implied by ""tried and bailed out multiple times"" and ""I have to do it.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want this to end.""
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is clear.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""knife"" (past), ""rope"" (current), ""building"" (potential).
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I tried with a knife"" (past action), ""I have a rope"" (preparation/means available).
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' Yes, ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have to do it.""

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Both. ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""I tried with a knife"" refer to past events. ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have a rope,"" ""I have to do it"" refer to current/future intentions.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? Yes, ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" and ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" explicitly describe past incomplete attempts.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly describes past suicide attempts (""I have tried and bailed out multiple times,"" ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work.""). According to the definition of 'Attempt': ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" The post explicitly mentions past incomplete attempts, making 'Attempt' the most appropriate classification, despite also containing elements of 'Behavior' (current means, imminent intent).

- Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life: ""I just want to end it."" This is a strong implication of wanting to end life.
- Emotional indicators: ""Tired of it,"" ""No point to anything in life with depression,"" ""I feel pain,"" ""useless,"" ""most useless pos known to mankind,"" ""A fly is worth more than i am."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and low self-worth.
- Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
- References to past attempts: None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""I just want to end it"" strongly implies suicidal intent.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I just want to end it.""
- If unclear, consider emotional context: The emotional context is severe distress with clear implied intent to end life, moving it beyond 'indicator'.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? No.
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? No, it expresses a desire (""I just want to end it"") but lacks specific imminent timing like ""tonight"" or ""now,"" or any action/preparation.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current desire/intention.
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
- The post contains a strongly implied expression of suicidal intent (""I just want to end it"").
- It does not mention a specific plan, method, preparations, actions taken, or imminent timing that would classify it as 'behavior'.
- It does not describe a past attempt.
- Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life**: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" (strong implication of wanting to die/not be alive). ""depressed enough to attempt properly again"" (explicit mention of ""attempt"" and ""again"" implies a past suicide attempt).
    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""Tired of being alone,"" ""depressed.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: No specific *current* plan or method is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts**: Yes, ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates a past attempt that was not successful or complete.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" strongly implies a desire to die. ""attempt properly again"" explicitly refers to a suicide attempt.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No, not for a current or imminent plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No, not for a current or imminent plan.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" suggests a desire for an imminent outcome, but it's a passive wish, not an active plan or action. The potential future attempt is conditional on Christmas not happening.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
        *   ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" refers to a current desire for a future outcome.
        *   ""Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" refers to a *future* potential trigger leading to a *future* potential attempt.
        *   ""attempt properly again"" clearly refers to a *past* attempt (implied by ""again"" and ""properly"" suggesting a previous incomplete or unsuccessful attempt).

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The phrase ""attempt properly again"" is the most critical element. It directly describes a past suicide attempt, even if it was incomplete or unsuccessful (""properly again"" implies the previous one was not ""proper"").
    *   According to the definition for 'Attempt': ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear.""
    *   The post contains current ideation (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"") and future conditional ideation/behavior, but the clear reference to a past attempt takes precedence for classification.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""looking for someone to kill me,"" and ""chop me up,"" with the goal of ""never get found again."" This is a clear desire to end one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** While not explicitly stated, the extreme request implies severe distress and a desire to escape.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post outlines a specific method: being killed by someone else, having the body hidden, and being ""chopped up."" The phrase ""I am looking for someone"" indicates an active step or preparation towards this goal.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no mentions of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""looking for someone to kill me"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent, even if it involves another party.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""kill me and hide my body so that my family will never find out,"" and ""never get found again.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: The intent is very clear and explicit.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""kill me and hide my body,"" and ""chop me up."" This is a detailed method for how the user wishes to die and for the disposal of their body.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I am looking for someone"" indicates an active step being taken to facilitate the desired outcome.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? While not giving a specific timeframe like ""tonight,"" the active search (""looking for someone"") suggests a strong, current intent to proceed with the plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I am looking for someone to kill me"").
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Too strong. The post contains explicit suicidal intent and a detailed plan.
    *   **Ideation:** While it contains suicidal thoughts, it goes beyond mere thoughts. The post describes a specific, detailed plan/method (""kill me and hide my body,"" ""chop me up"") and an action being taken to facilitate it (""looking for someone""). This moves it past simple ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits best. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""looking for someone to kill me"") *plus* a specific plan/method (being killed, body hidden, chopped up) and an action taken towards that plan (""looking for someone""). The specificity and the active search elevate it beyond mere ideation.
    *   **Attempt:** No past attempt is described.

Yes, ""fantasizing about my death"" and ""some days I consider it"" imply this, despite the counter-statement ""I have no desire to die.""

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to an ongoing struggle (""10 years,"" ""Every fucking day"") and current, though intermittent, consideration (""some days I consider it""). No past attempts are described.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
*   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) by explicitly mentioning ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" and stating ""some days I consider it.""
*   It clearly describes suicidal thoughts and feelings (""fantasizing about my death,"" ""consider it"") without any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing. The internal conflict (""I have no desire to die. But I'm so fed up... some days I consider it"") still falls under the definition of ideation, as the *consideration* of suicide is present.
*   There are no specific plans, preparations, or imminent intent to classify it as Behavior.
*   There is no description of a past initiated action to classify it as Attempt.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post conveys severe distress, including ""problems are getting worse,"" ""struggling more and more,"" ""emotionally neglected,"" ""depressed,"" ""unimportant,"" ""scared,"" ""sad,"" and ""envious."" This indicates significant hopelessness and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There are no mentions of specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparations. In fact, the post explicitly states an *inability* to harm oneself.
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts, incomplete or otherwise.

    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? **Yes**. The phrase ""I just really wish to end my life"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent. ""To just end all this"" is also a strong implication.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes**. ""I just really wish to end my life"" directly expresses this.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is clear and explicit here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? **No**.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No**. The post explicitly states the opposite: ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest.""
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' **No**, there is no indication of imminent timing or intent to act *now*. The statement is a wish coupled with an inability to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to current wishes and feelings, but explicitly notes an inability to act. There is no mention of past attempts.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** ""I don't want to live this again"" strongly implies a desire to escape the current state of being, which can be interpreted as a wish not to continue living under these circumstances.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""I lost control,"" ""I've lost control of my head,"" ""I just want to cry,"" ""I can't breathe,"" ""I want to scream help please"" indicate severe distress, panic, and a feeling of being overwhelmed.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** No explicit mention of a past suicide attempt. ""I don't want to live this again"" refers to not wanting to re-experience the current state of distress, not a past attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""I don't want to live this again"" is a strong implication of not wanting to continue living in the current state, bordering on a desire to die to escape the pain.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I don't want to live this again"" implies a desire to escape the current overwhelming feelings and situation, which is a form of not wanting to be alive in that state.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The distress is severe and the implication of not wanting to live is strong.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, it expresses a current state of distress and a desire not to continue living *this way*, but not an immediate plan for action.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The post describes current overwhelming feelings (""I lost control,"" ""I can't breathe"") and a future-oriented desire not to re-experience them (""I don't want to live this again"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post expresses severe distress and a strong implied desire not to continue living in the current state (""I don't want to live this again""). This moves beyond general distress (Indicator) because of the strong implication of not wanting to be alive. However, there are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent (Behavior), nor is there a description of a past attempt (Attempt). Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Ideation', which includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without concrete plans or actions.

Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving.

*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes. ""I left a note"" is a clear preparation/action taken.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? ""decided this is it"" combined with ""left a note"" suggests a strong, possibly imminent intent, or an action that has just been completed/is ongoing.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The phrase ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it"" uses past tense (""left,"" ""decided""), indicating that the note has already been written and the decision made. This points to a current or very recent action/preparation for suicide. It is not describing a past attempt that was interrupted or failed, but rather a concrete step taken towards ending life.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit suicidal intent (""reason to die,"" ""decided this is it""). Crucially, it also describes a concrete action taken: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it."" Leaving a suicide note is a significant preparation for suicide. This moves the post beyond mere ideation into the realm of 'Behavior', which includes ""preparations or actions taken."" It does not describe a past attempt that was initiated and then stopped or failed, so it does not fit the 'Attempt' category.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it.

Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone.

It also explicitly says, ""I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore."" and ends with a direct question, ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with indicators of severe distress, hopelessness, despair, loneliness, shame (""unstable freak,"" ""creep,"" ""short ugly bastard with no prospects"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** While no specific method is named (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump""), the question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" is a direct inquiry about *methods* and their *consequences*. This indicates an active consideration of the practicalities of suicide, moving beyond passive thoughts.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The post mentions past *ideation* (""screamed that I wanted to die"") but does not describe any initiated or incomplete past *attempts*.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""I just. Want. To die."" ""I don't want to be a burden anymore.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: Not unclear; intent is explicit.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is chosen, but there is a direct inquiry about *how* to kill oneself, with a specific condition (""without leaving a body""). This is an active step towards identifying or formulating a method/plan.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The direct question about *how* to commit suicide, combined with the intense desire to die, suggests a significant readiness to act and an active search for a means, which is stronger than passive ideation.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to past ideation, but the core of the post expresses strong current desire to die and a future-oriented question about *how* to achieve it.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No, only past ideation.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** While the post clearly shows ideation (""I just. Want. To die.""), the concluding question, ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"", goes beyond mere thought or desire. It indicates an active search for a *method* or *plan*, even if a specific one hasn't been chosen or prepared. This active inquiry into the *means* of suicide elevates the risk from pure ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** This category includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus either: (1) a specific plan or method, (2) preparations or actions taken, or (3) strong intent with imminent timing. The direct question about *how* to kill oneself, with a specific criterion, signifies a progression towards actively considering the *execution* of suicide. It's a step towards formulating a plan, even if the plan itself isn't fully detailed. This active search for a method, rather than just wishing for death, aligns with the ""Behavior"" category's intent to bridge thoughts and actions.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out as no past attempt is described.

The active search for a method, implied by the question ""How do I kill myself..."", pushes this beyond simple ideation into the realm of 'Behavior' because it signifies an active consideration of the practical steps involved in a suicidal act.

The phrase ""eternal void"" clearly refers to death.
*   **Emotional indicators:** Severe hopelessness (""No point in it all,"" ""won't get anywhere,"" ""don't see a future""), despair, feeling trapped (""trapped in limbo""), and self-blame/shame (""people are starting to lose hope in me (as they should)"", ""keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me"").

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, strongly implied. Phrases like ""push me over the edge,"" ""wasn't meant for this world,"" ""no point in moving on,"" ""don't see a future,"" ""one last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" and ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"" all strongly imply a desire to end life.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The emotional context is severe distress, and the intent is strongly implied.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? The post expresses a strong desire for a ""push"" and readiness for the ""eternal void,"" but it does not specify an imminent timeframe or concrete action, such as ""tonight"" or ""now."" It speaks of a general readiness rather than an immediate plan.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current/future intentions (""I need something to really push me,"" ""One last push is all I need"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses strong suicidal thoughts and a desire to end life (""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""I wasn't meant for this world,"" ""I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void,"" ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'. However, it does not mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing that would classify it as 'Behavior'. There is no description of a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit/strongly implied suicidal thoughts and feelings without specific plans or actions.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly mentions ""People who commit suicide."" However, this is a general statement about others, not a personal expression of suicidal intent by the poster.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post discusses ""painful emotions"" and people ""snapping and breaking down,"" but these are attributed to the general ""we"" (referring to people in general who might reach that point), not explicitly to the poster's current emotional state or suicidal intent.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied?** Yes, ""commit suicide"" is explicit.
    *   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** No. The post discusses the *reasons* people commit suicide, not the poster's own desire to die.
    *   **If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.'** The post expresses empathy and understanding for those who reach a suicidal state, but does not convey severe distress *from the poster with implied suicidal intent*.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post discusses suicide in a general, empathetic, and explanatory manner, focusing on the underlying reasons people might reach that point. It does not express the poster's own suicidal intent, thoughts, plans, or past attempts. While it mentions suicide, it lacks the personal expression of suicidal desire or intent required for 'Ideation,' 'Behavior,' or 'Attempt.' Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category as it lacks explicit or strongly implied expressions of *the poster's* suicidal intent.

Based on the analysis, the post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""If I kill myself,"" ""leave this world forever"") but does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or indications of imminent action. It also does not describe a past attempt. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.

I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months.

*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. ""nearly killing myself one night"" refers to a past event. ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" refers to current/future intentions.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, ""nearly killing myself one night"" clearly describes a past action with suicidal intent, even if it was incomplete or interrupted.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly describes a past action initiated with suicidal intent (""nearly killing myself one night""). This aligns directly with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent."" The rules also state: ""If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" While the post also contains elements that would fit 'Behavior' (specific future plan/method), the clear mention of a past attempt takes precedence according to the given rules.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post states ""shits not worth it anymore. not for me,"" ""i need a way out,"" and most explicitly, ""i want to take myself out."" It also says ""i just need it to stop.""
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""i need help,"" ""too much happening,"" ""disappoint and burden other people,"" ""scared it'll be painful."" Shows significant distress, hopelessness, and feeling like a burden.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned. The user asks ""what do i do, please?"" indicating a lack of a concrete plan.
*   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""i want to take myself out"" is a clear, explicit expression of suicidal intent.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i need a way out,"" ""i want to take myself out,"" ""i just need it to stop.""
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' Not unclear; explicit intent is present.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No. The user asks for advice (""what do i do, please?"").
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No specific imminent timing is mentioned. The user expresses a desire to ""take myself out"" and ""need it to stop,"" but the question ""what do i do, please?"" and the fear of pain (""scared it'll be painful"") indicate contemplation rather than an immediate, firm decision to act.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current intentions/feelings.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
*   The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""i want to take myself out"") and expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. This rules out 'Indicator'.
*   It does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
*   It lacks a specific plan, method, preparations, or strong imminent timing to act. While there is a strong desire to end life, the absence of these elements distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. The user is asking for help and expressing fear, indicating a state of ideation rather than concrete steps towards an action.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Key elements**: The phrase ""The more I live the more I want to die"" is a direct and explicit expression of suicidal ideation. ""Screw this"" and ""Can't be fucked with anything anymore"" indicate severe distress, frustration, and hopelessness.
    *   **Emotional indicators**: Despair, hopelessness, frustration, desire to end life.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts**: None mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""I want to die"" is an explicit statement of suicidal intent.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I want to die.""

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, it expresses a persistent feeling (""The more I live the more I want to die"") rather than an immediate, time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight"").

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current intention/feeling.
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post clearly expresses a desire to die (""I want to die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or strong imminent intent, which would classify it as 'Behavior'.
    *   It also does not describe a past attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., 'I want to die,' 'I’m going to die soon') without specific plans or actions.""

It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (due to the absence of a specific plan/method or imminent intent) or 'Attempt' (due to the absence of a past initiated action). It is beyond 'Indicator' because suicidal intent is explicit.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"") and strong intent.

While no specific method is stated, the act of writing suicide notes/emails is a significant step in preparation.

*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here."" This is a specific method and a concrete preparatory action (ordering the substance) with a clear intent to use it.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains a strong implication of suicidal intent (""Ending it soon"") and explicitly details a specific method (""14 grams of dextromethorphan"") along with a preparatory action (""I ordered... and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here"") and imminent timing (""as soon as it gets here""). This aligns perfectly with the 'Behavior' definition, which includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan/method or preparations/actions taken. It does not describe a past completed or interrupted attempt, so it is not 'Attempt'. It goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings, so it is not 'Ideation' or 'Indicator'.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post repeatedly questions ""how people can want to live?"" and ""how they actually find important to stay alive?"". The phrase ""I have 60 fucking years left"" expresses significant distress and a negative outlook on the prospect of continuing to live for a long duration. While not explicitly stating ""I want to die,"" these questions strongly imply a lack of desire to live and a questioning of the value of life, which leans towards suicidal thoughts.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The tone is one of weariness, despair, and a profound questioning of existence and the value of a long life. The use of ""fucking"" emphasizes the negative sentiment.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied?** Strongly implied. The core of the post is a questioning of the desire to live and the importance of staying alive, which suggests the author does not share these desires.
*   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, implied through the repeated rhetorical questions about why anyone would want to live or find it important to stay alive, and the negative framing of having ""60 fucking years left.""

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) by directly and repeatedly questioning the fundamental desire and importance of living, which constitutes a strong implication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. It does not include specific plans, methods, or actions (Behavior), nor does it describe a past attempt (Attempt). Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses implied suicidal thoughts/feelings without concrete steps.

- The post discusses the topic of ""passive suicidal"" individuals and the concept of ""suicide by cop.""
- It expresses frustration (""Why would people be so counterproductive?"") regarding how others might interact with suicidal individuals.
- There are no direct or implied statements about the poster's own suicidal thoughts, feelings, plans, or past attempts. The discussion is entirely about hypothetical situations involving *other* people.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, words like ""passive suicidal,"" ""suicidal,"" and ""suicide by cop"" are used.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the perspective of the person writing the post. The poster is discussing the state of *others*.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to hypothetical future actions of *others* (""they may just think that's their opportunity"").
- Are past attempts described? No, not by the poster.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
- The post mentions suicide as a topic of discussion but does not express any personal suicidal intent, ideation, plans, or past attempts from the person writing it. The distress expressed is about the actions of others, not about the poster's own state of mind regarding suicide.
- According to the rules, ""The suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, not others mentioned."" Since the post discusses suicide in a general context without indicating personal risk, it falls into the 'Indicator' category.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""I do"" want to kill myself), which moves it beyond 'Indicator'.

    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post is filled with indicators of severe distress: ""so stressed,"" ""bawling,"" ""incredibly difficult,"" ""mental health over this school year has been bad,"" ""fucked up my head,"" ""confused,"" ""pathetic,"" ""desolate,"" ""crying myself to sleep.""
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** There are no mentions of specific plans, methods (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump""), or preparations (e.g., ""I wrote a note,"" ""I got the pills"").
    *   **References to past attempts:** There are no references to past suicide attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes.** The post explicitly states, ""I'm finally considering suicide.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes.** ""I don't want to do this anymore"" and the overall despair, coupled with ""considering suicide,"" imply a desire to end the current state or life itself.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is explicit (""considering suicide""), not just implied.

    *   Are specific methods mentioned? **No.**
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No.**
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? **No.** While the user is clearly distressed and considering suicide, there is no mention of immediate timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") that would suggest imminent intent. The phrase ""It'll be all over by then"" refers to the end of the two-week exam period, not an imminent suicidal act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current thoughts and intentions: ""I'm finally considering suicide.""
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? **No.**

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress and explicitly mentions ""considering suicide,"" ruling out 'Indicator'.
    *   It clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and feelings (""considering suicide,"" ""I don't want to do this anymore"") without detailing a specific plan, method, preparations, or imminent timing. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'.
    *   It does not include a specific plan, method, preparations, or strong imminent intent, which would be required for 'Behavior'.
    *   It does not describe a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:**
        *   ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to"" - Explicitly states a desire for suicide.
        *   ""I feel like killing myself."" - Explicit statement of suicidal thoughts.
        *   ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't."" - Explicit statement of suicidal intent, but with a clear barrier (lack of ""guts"").
        *   ""I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live"" - Implies a future scenario where life would not be worth living.
        *   ""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it"" - Expresses hopelessness and lack of purpose.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Severe distress, pain from family, loneliness, hopelessness, anxiety, feeling like a burden, feeling misunderstood, crying, calling hotlines (then hanging up), and self-doubt.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** Explicitly states ""I've never actually attempted suicide.""

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes.
        *   ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to""
        *   ""I feel like killing myself.""
        *   ""i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
        *   ""despite wanting to"" (referring to suicide)
        *   ""I feel like killing myself""
        *   ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would""
        *   ""no other reason to live""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The intent is explicit here.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No. The phrase ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't"" indicates a *lack* of imminent intent or capability to act.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The post primarily refers to current feelings and ongoing desires (""wanting to,"" ""I feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts... I would""). There is also a hypothetical future scenario (""once everyone I care about dies, that's the end"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No, the post explicitly states, ""I've never actually attempted suicide.""

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and desires (""wanting to,"" ""feel like killing myself,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
    *   However, it explicitly states a lack of past attempts and a current barrier to acting (""but I don't"" have the guts), and does not mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timing. This prevents it from being classified as 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.
    *   Therefore, it best fits the definition of 'Ideation': explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions.

*   **Key elements**: The post explicitly states ""my plan to kill myself."" It mentions that this plan was revealed to family by a ""friend,"" and that the family is now ""watching"" the individual to prevent them from acting on the plan.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post goes beyond mere suicidal thoughts (Ideation) by including an explicit statement of intent, a specific timeline (""3 weeks from now""), and a described preparatory action (isolating for 3 weeks).

*   **Emotional indicators**: While not explicitly stated, the nature of the question and the listed items suggest severe distress and a desire to end life.
*   **Specific plans/methods/preparations**: Yes, the post lists specific substances (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, alcohol) and quantities (3 bottles, 30 20mg pills, a bottle full). This constitutes a specific method and indicates preparation (having the items).
*   **References to past attempts**: No.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) and mere thoughts (Ideation) because it includes a specific method and evidence of preparation (having the items). It does not describe a completed or interrupted past action (Attempt). Therefore, it fits the 'Behavior' category, which includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts plus a specific plan/method or preparations/actions taken.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""planning to end it,"" ""suicide"").

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness and being a burden. However, it *lacks* any explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent, direct expressions of wanting to die, or any mention of plans, methods, or past attempts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator', which describes posts showing general distress or severe hopelessness without a clear desire to die.

*   **Emotional indicators**: ""I feel like shit,"" ""alone and depressed,"" ""fucking sad."" These indicate significant emotional distress, sadness, and loneliness.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: None. The user is asking for a phone call or Discord voice call to talk.
*   **References to past attempts**: None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No. The user expresses intense sadness and loneliness and is seeking connection to alleviate these feelings.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The user's goal is ""to feel a little less alone and depressed"" and ""to at least pretend that I have a friend,"" which indicates a desire to cope and feel better, not to end their life.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No. The post suggests an immediate need for connection to alleviate current distress, not an imminent intent to self-harm.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current feelings and a request for immediate interaction (""right now"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post expresses significant emotional distress, sadness, and loneliness (""I feel like shit,"" ""alone and depressed,"" ""fucking sad""). However, it *lacks* any explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent. The user is actively seeking connection and support (""would anybody talk on the phone with me or Discord voice call?"", ""I need to vent about it or just talk to someone... to feel a little less alone and depressed""). This behavior is a coping mechanism to deal with distress, not an indication of suicidal thoughts or plans. Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category, which describes general distress without clear suicidal intent.

I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try.

I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work.

*   **Emotional indicators:** Severe distress, hopelessness, worthlessness (""completely worthless person""), anxiety, and feeling abandoned by the system (""the system in place doesn't work"").
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** ""I wrote a note today."" This is a significant preparatory action for suicide.
*   **References to past attempts:** No explicit past suicide attempts are described. The ER visit was a result of ""reaching out for help,"" not a described attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? No explicit mention, but strongly implied by the overall despair, the inability to ""keep going,"" and overcoming the ""fear of non existence after death.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, very strongly implied by phrases like ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this"" and ""lately it feels like I just can't continue.""
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' This post has severe distress and very strong implied intent.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I wrote a note today."" This is a clear sign of preparation.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? While ""tonight"" isn't used, the phrases ""today,"" ""lately it feels like,"" and ""this is my last chance"" suggest a current and critical state of intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? The post primarily focuses on current feelings and a recent action (""I wrote a note today"") indicating current/future intentions.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No, the ER visit was a result of seeking help, not an attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the strong implied suicidal intent. It also goes beyond 'Ideation' because it explicitly mentions a preparatory action: ""I wrote a note today."" This action, combined with the clear implied suicidal intent and severe distress, fits the definition of 'Behavior', which includes ""preparations or actions taken"" alongside suicidal thoughts. It does not describe a completed or interrupted past attempt, so 'Attempt' is not appropriate.

*   **Key elements**: The post explicitly states ""Tried to end my life again,"" indicating a clear intent to die. The phrase ""Tried didn't work"" and ""Didn't work"" refers to actions initiated with suicidal intent that were unsuccessful or incomplete.
*   **Emotional indicators**: Not explicitly stated, but the act itself implies severe distress.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: Not detailed in the post, but the past tense ""Tried"" confirms that an action was taken.
*   **References to past attempts**: Yes, the post explicitly describes past, failed attempts: ""Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.""

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
Based on the analysis, the post describes a past suicide attempt that was initiated but did not result in death (""didn't work""). This aligns directly with the definition of 'Attempt': ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent.""

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a strong desire for death (""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head""). While specific methods are mentioned, they are phrased as something the user *deserves* or *wishes* someone else would do to them, rather than a plan they intend to carry out themselves. Crucially, the user explicitly states, ""I have no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway."" This directly aligns with the definition of 'Ideation', which includes explicit suicidal thoughts ""without specific plans or actions."" The mention of specific methods as desired outcomes, despite the lack of personal planning, still falls under the scope of ideation when the individual explicitly denies having plans. It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' because there are no personal plans, preparations, or imminent intent to act. It is far beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicidal content. There is no mention of a past 'Attempt'.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states ""Survived OD,"" and quotes someone saying ""you can't kill yourself with ibuprofen."" The user also states, ""I wanted to"" (referring to dying).
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""I feel stupid,"" ""I'm still processing everything and still feel weird,"" ""I feel bad asking my boyfriend.""
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The post details a specific method and action taken: ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle.""
*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** The opening phrase ""Survived OD"" directly refers to a past overdose, which is an initiated action with suicidal intent. The details provided confirm this was an attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""kill yourself,"" ""OD,"" and ""I wanted to"" (die).
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""120+ pills of ibuprofen"" and ""hard liquor from the bottle.""
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, the act of swallowing the pills and drinking the liquor.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, this describes a past event.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? This clearly refers to a *past* event. Phrases like ""Survived OD,"" ""I can hear my mom In the back of my head saying,"" ""When I sat there and swallowed,"" and ""I held off going to the hospital"" all indicate a completed action in the past.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, a past overdose is described as an initiated action with suicidal intent.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""Survived OD"") and provides details of the actions taken during that attempt (""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor from the bottle"") with clear suicidal intent (""I wanted to""). This directly aligns with the definition of 'Attempt'.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""Suicide has become my quick solution.""

*   **Emotional indicators:** ""totally helpless and misunderstood,"" ""paranoid delusions,"" ""the world is just so rotten to me,"" ""sick of every worthless person around me,"" ""All words are meaningless. Every action is malicious."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.

*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""Suicide has become my quick solution.""
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all,"" combined with the explicit mention of suicide as a solution.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No specific timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned. It states suicide ""has become"" a solution, indicating it's a current consideration, but not an immediate action.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and feelings (""Suicide has become my quick solution,"" ""I still want to find a way to get away from it all""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'. However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or a strong indication of imminent action. It also does not describe a past attempt.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post mentions ""death stranding"" as a game reference and ""hard to keep going,"" which indicates struggle with life, but not explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent. There are no mentions of dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the user's own desire to end life.
*   **Emotional indicators:** ""depression,"" ""hard to keep going,"" ""badly mangled (psychically),"" ""slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away."" These indicate severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and the chronic nature of their suffering.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
*   **References to past attempts:** None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? No. ""Hard to keep going"" expresses difficulty in living, not a desire to die.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' While there is severe distress, there is no implied intent to die.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to current, ongoing struggle with depression.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post describes the profound struggle and pain of living with depression (""hard to keep going,"" ""badly mangled,"" ""never really goes away""). It expresses severe hopelessness and distress. However, it *lacks* any explicit or strongly implied statements of suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to die soon""). There are no plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Indicator', which describes general distress, sadness, or vague references to life's difficulties without a clear desire to die, and where severe hopelessness alone is not enough to move beyond this category.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
- Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life: The user states ""I've been cutting my self for a long time"" (self-harm, described as pain subversion). Explicitly states ""For the past month I've been contemplating suicide."" Expresses a conditional intent: ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it."" Mentions a shared agreement: ""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together.""
- Emotional indicators: ""feeling numb,"" ""don't get any joy out of life,"" ""don't feel love for anyone,"" ""fucking lost here.""
- Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, jump) is mentioned for the poster's *own* potential suicide. However, the agreement ""we will do it together"" constitutes a shared plan/intent to act.
- References to past attempts: The user mentions ""cutting myself"" but clarifies it's ""to subvert the pain to a physical one,"" not an attempt to die. The girl's ""failed attempt to commit suicide"" is mentioned, but this is not the poster's attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""contemplating suicide,"" ""I'm ending it,"" ""we will do it together"" (in reference to killing themselves).

- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No specific preparations or actions taken by the *poster* are mentioned for suicide.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes. The statement ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it"" indicates strong, conditional intent. The agreement ""we will do it together"" constitutes a shared plan to act, moving beyond mere contemplation.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Refers to past contemplation (""For the past month I've been contemplating suicide"") and strong future conditional intent (""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it"") and a future conditional agreement/plan (""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"").
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No past suicide attempt by the poster is described. The self-harm is described as a coping mechanism.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""contemplating suicide,"" ""I didn't want to live""). This goes beyond 'Indicator'. It moves beyond simple 'Ideation' because it includes a strong, conditional statement of intent to act (""I'm ending it"") and, crucially, a shared agreement/plan to commit suicide (""we will do it together""). This shared plan, even without a specific method detailed, represents a concrete step towards action, fitting the 'Behavior' definition of having ""a specific plan"" or ""strong intent with imminent timing."" It does not describe a past suicide attempt by the poster, so it's not 'Attempt'.

These are *not* expressions of suicidal intent by the user, but rather abusive taunts directed *at* the user by their parents.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The user is clearly experiencing severe emotional distress, as evidenced by the parents' quotes about ""depression bullshit,"" ""crying,"" and the user's own question ""why did you want to have a daughter in the first place."" The overall tone is one of profound pain, neglect, and abuse.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plans, methods, or preparations are stated *by the user*. The methods mentioned (""gun,"" ""cut your wrists"") are parts of the parents' taunts.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, not from the user's own voice. The user's direct statement expresses pain and confusion about the abuse, not a desire to die.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: The emotional context is severe distress. However, the lack of the user's *own* explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent prevents classification beyond 'Indicator' based solely on the parents' words.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**

*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No signs of preparation or actions taken *by the user* are described.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No imminent intent is expressed by the user.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The parents' quotes refer to implied past actions (""Did you try to kill yourself again?"") and ongoing/future taunts. The user is presenting these as a record of abuse, not as their own current or future suicidal intentions.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? The parents' quotes *refer to* past attempts/self-harm, but the user *does not describe* these actions themselves. The rule states ""The post *describes* a past suicide attempt."" The user is quoting references to an attempt, not describing the attempt itself.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post conveys extreme distress and a history of severe abuse, which includes taunts about suicide and implied past self-harm/attempts. However, the user *themselves* does not express explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die"") nor do they *describe* a past suicide attempt from their own perspective. The information about suicide/self-harm comes from the quoted words of the parents, not the user's direct statement of intent or action. While the risk is clearly high due to the abuse, the classification rules require the user's own expression of intent or description of action. The post primarily serves as a documentation of the abuse. Therefore, it falls under 'Indicator' as it shows severe distress and references to suicide/self-harm, but lacks the user's own explicit suicidal intent or description of an attempt.

*   **Key elements**: ""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?"", ""I just need a way to Kim's [kill myself]"", ""don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit"", ""someone just give me a straight up answer.""
*   **Emotional indicators**: Desperation, clear intent to end life, frustration with typical interventions.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: The post is *asking* for methods, not stating one. No preparations or actions are mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts**: None.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""kill yourself"" is explicit. ""I just need a way to kill myself"" is also explicit.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, clearly.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No, the user is soliciting methods.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The urgency (""just need a way,"" ""straight up answer"") indicates strong intent, but it's a request for information *before* action, not a statement of an imminent action itself (e.g., ""I'm doing it tonight""). The intent is contingent on finding a method.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions, seeking a way to act.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   **Indicator**: Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal intent.
*   **Ideation**: The post clearly includes explicit suicidal thoughts and feelings (""I want to kill myself,"" ""I just need a way to kill myself""). While there is a strong desire to find a method, the post *lacks* a specific plan, preparations, or a statement of imminent action independent of finding a method. It's actively seeking *how* to proceed, which falls under strong ideation rather than a concrete step towards behavior.
*   **Behavior**: This category requires a specific plan/method, preparations/actions taken, or strong intent with imminent timing (e.g., ""I want to be gone tonight"") *even without a method*. The user is *asking for* a method, not stating one, nor are they describing preparations or actions. The urgency, while high, is tied to finding a method, not an immediate, unconditional intent to act.
*   **Attempt**: Not applicable, as no past attempt is described.

Based on the definitions, the post expresses clear suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to act, but without a concrete plan, actions, or unconditional imminent intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Key elements**: ""write a suicidal note again,"" ""My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.""
    *   **Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm**: ""suicidal note"" explicitly mentions suicide.
    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""pain on the inside,"" ""stomach is literally convulsing"" indicate severe distress and suffering.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: ""write a suicidal note again"" is a clear preparatory action. The word ""again"" implies this is a recurring or contemplated action.
    *   **References to past attempts**: The phrase ""again"" in the context of writing a suicidal note suggests past *preparatory behavior*, not necessarily a past attempt (where a concrete action with suicidal intent was initiated).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""suicidal note"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the act of writing a ""suicidal note"" directly implies a desire to end one's life, reinforced by the intense internal pain.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method of *suicide* (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""write a suicidal note"" is a concrete sign of preparation or an action taken in furtherance of suicidal intent.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? ""I think I'm going to write..."" suggests current contemplation and potential imminent action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""I think I'm going to write..."" refers to a current intention for a future action. ""again"" refers to a past instance of the same preparatory behavior.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No past *attempt* (an initiated action with suicidal intent) is described. However, past *preparatory behavior* (writing a note) is implied.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""suicidal note"").
    *   It describes a specific preparatory action (""write a suicidal note""). This action falls under ""preparations or actions taken"" as defined in the 'Behavior' category.
    *   It does not describe a past *attempt* (where a self-harming action was initiated with intent to die), which would classify it as 'Attempt'. Writing a note is a precursor, not the attempt itself.
    *   It goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings, as a specific action (writing the note) is being contemplated/planned, thus it's more than 'Ideation'.
    *   It's far beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicidal mention and preparatory action.

Based on the presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with a specific preparatory action (""write a suicidal note""), the 'Behavior' category is the most appropriate fit.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, ""slaying myself"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The mention of ""massacre"" alongside ""slaying myself"" suggests severe distress or internal conflict.
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for ""slaying myself.""
*   **References to past attempts:** No.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   **Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied?** Yes, ""slaying myself"" is a strong implication of wanting to die by suicide.
*   **Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive?** Yes, ""slaying myself"" expresses a desire to end one's life.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   **Are specific methods mentioned?** No, ""slaying myself"" is a general term, not a specific method (like ""pills"" or ""jump off a bridge"").
*   **Are there signs of preparation or actions taken?** No.
*   **Does the post suggest imminent intent?** No, the phrase ""I will end up... or maybe just slaying myself"" suggests a future possibility or contemplation, not immediate intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   **Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?** It refers to a future possibility (""I will end up"").
*   **Are past attempts described?** No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains a strong implication of suicidal thoughts (""slaying myself""). However, it lacks any specific plan, method, preparations, or indication of imminent action. It describes a potential future outcome or contemplation rather than a concrete step towards suicide. This aligns with the definition of 'Ideation', which includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts without specific plans or actions. It goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the direct implication of suicide, but does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (lack of plan/imminence) or 'Attempt' (no past action described).

I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity.

This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrase ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" is a strong implication of suicidal intent.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts (""thinking of ending it all"") combined with significant emotional distress. However, it does not mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, imminent timing, or past attempts. This aligns directly with the definition of 'Ideation', which includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend""). It goes beyond mere ideation by including a specific timeframe (""this weekend"") and a concrete preparation/action (""get a will in place""). This combination of explicit intent, imminent timing, and preparation aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not 'Attempt' because no past action was initiated, and it is more than 'Ideation' due to the preparations and imminent intent.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:**
    *   ""The final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October is coming up."" - Implies a life-or-death stakes.
    *   ""for the first time i don't wanna die"" - Explicitly states a *current lack* of desire to die, indicating a shift from past feelings.
    *   ""it's not like i wanna live either"" - Shows ambivalence about living, but is immediately followed by reasons to live.
    *   ""I really cannot live if i fail."" - A strong conditional statement implying suicidal intent if a specific event occurs in the future.
    *   ""The right time is gone, i have no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep."" - Discusses past methods/means and current *lack* of access or effectiveness, implying past consideration but no current plan. ""Blades i used to cut"" refers to past self-harm, not necessarily a past suicide attempt.
    *   ""I don't even know how I'll do it"" - In context (""how much I'll have to wait before i finally get some antidepressants but I'm feeling better nonetheless and i don't even know how I'll do it""), this phrase refers to coping or living without antidepressants, not how to die.

*   **Emotional indicators:**
    *   ""almost happy,"" ""almost enjoying doing stuff,"" ""have a purpose,"" ""in a decent place right now,"" ""feeling better nonetheless,"" ""want to keep doing things."" - These are strong positive emotional indicators, showing a current shift away from despair and towards hope and future-oriented thinking.

*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
    *   No current specific plans or preparations for suicide are mentioned. Instead, the post explicitly states a *lack* of access to methods (""no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep""). Preparations mentioned are for moving and a new room, which are life-affirming.

*   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:**
    *   ""blades i used to cut"" refers to past self-harm, but the post does not describe an initiated action with suicidal intent that was stopped or completed.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? (Yes/No)
    *   No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
    *   Strong implication: ""I really cannot live if i fail."" This is a conditional implication of suicidal intent.
    *   However, the post explicitly states ""for the first time i don't wanna die,"" which is a direct *negation* of current suicidal intent.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? (Yes/No)
    *   Yes, conditionally (""I really cannot live if i fail"").
    *   But also, explicitly, ""for the first time i don't wanna die"" and ""I want to keep doing things."" The overall current sentiment is *not* wanting to die.

*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.'
    *   The emotional context is primarily one of *reduced* distress and a shift towards positivity and hope, despite a looming stressor.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump off a bridge"")
    *   Methods are mentioned (""meds,"" ""jump from,"" ""blades"") but in the context of *lack of current access or effectiveness* for suicidal action.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? (e.g., ""I wrote a note,"" ""I put a belt around my neck"")
    *   No signs of current suicidal preparation or actions.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.'
    *   No imminent intent. The ""final test"" is a future event, and the current sentiment is *not* wanting to die.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")?
    *   ""blades i used to cut"" and ""The right time is gone"" refer to past events/considerations.
    *   ""I really cannot live if i fail"" refers to a future conditional intention.
    *   ""for the first time i don't wanna die,"" ""I'm almost happy,"" ""I'm in a decent place right now"" refer to current positive feelings and a shift away from suicidal intent.
    *   The post describes a current state of *resisting* suicidal thoughts and finding reasons to live, despite a future conditional trigger.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post describes a significant shift away from suicidal ideation, explicitly stating ""for the first time i don't wanna die"" and detailing positive future plans and feelings. While it acknowledges past struggles and a conditional future risk (""I really cannot live if i fail""), the *current* overriding sentiment is one of not wanting to die and finding purpose. It does not describe a past attempt, current plans, or imminent intent. The conditional statement, while serious, is overshadowed by the strong current desire to live and the positive emotional state. This fits the 'Indicator' category, as the post primarily highlights a *lack* of active, explicit, or strongly implied *current* suicidal intent, despite acknowledging distress and past/future risks.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly conveys severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and a feeling of being utterly lost and drained by life's circumstances (""I don't know what to do anymore with my life""). However, it lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent, such as wanting to die, wishing to be gone, or stating an intention to end life. The despair is profound, but it falls short of indicating a desire for suicide. According to the definitions, ""Severe hopelessness alone isn’t enough—suicidal intent must be explicit or strongly implied to move beyond this category."" Therefore, it best fits the 'Indicator' category.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold""). Crucially, it also details specific methods (""slitting my wrist and bleeding out,"" ""shoot myself with a gun"") and expresses a readiness to act (""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do""). This combination of explicit suicidal thoughts and specific methods/plans fits the definition of 'Behavior'. It is not 'Ideation' because specific methods are present, and it is not 'Attempt' as no past action is described.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice.

The post goes far beyond general distress (Indicator) and mere thoughts (Ideation) by detailing specific methods, calculations, and preparations (""calculated how much,"" ""tested the strength,"" ""figured out how to ensure""). These actions constitute concrete steps towards a potential suicide, even if the final execution is currently held back by a specific personal conviction. The presence of detailed plans and preparations aligns with the definition of 'Behavior', which includes ""a specific plan or method"" or ""preparations or actions taken.""

*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method is mentioned. However, ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates imminent timing. The discussion about ""calling my grandparents,"" ""telling any of my friends that i love them and hugging my little brother"" are strong indicators of preparatory actions, often associated with saying goodbyes before a suicide. The user is debating *whether* to perform these ""goodbye"" actions, implying the main act is decided.
*   **References to past attempts:** ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"" indicates long-standing ideation, but not a past initiated attempt.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""kill myself"" is explicitly used. ""the day i chose is very soon"" and ""wanted to do this for over a decade"" are strong implications.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes. ""i'm not cut out for life and i can't even imagine mine being worth living.""

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes. The user is contemplating making ""goodbye"" calls/actions to loved ones, which are preparatory steps.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? Yes. ""the day i chose is very soon"" clearly indicates imminent timing. The user's statement ""i'm not interested in being talked down at all"" further reinforces firm and imminent intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Primarily current/future intentions (""the day i chose is very soon,"" ""i know a bunch of people are going to tell me that if i have people that love me i shouldn't kill myself"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No. ""I've wanted to do this for over a decade"" refers to long-term ideation, not a past initiated attempt.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post goes beyond mere ideation by indicating a chosen, imminent timing (""the day i chose is very soon"") and discussing preparatory ""goodbye"" actions (calling family, telling friends they are loved, hugging brother). It explicitly states a desire to ""kill myself"" and dismisses intervention. This combination of explicit suicidal intent, imminent timing, and preparatory actions aligns with the definition of 'Behavior'. It does not describe a past initiated attempt.

*   **Explicit suicidal intent**: ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" explicitly states a high level of suicidal thoughts.
*   **Desire to end suffering**: ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" strongly implies a desire to die or cease to exist to escape pain.
*   **Emotional indicators**: ""pain for over 5 years now,"" ""just cba anymore"" indicate chronic distress, exhaustion, and hopelessness.
*   **Withdrawal**: ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" suggests social withdrawal, which is a common symptom of severe depression and suicidal ideation, but not a direct action towards suicide.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes**. ""This the most suicidal I've been"" is explicit. ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" is a strong implication of wanting to die.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes**.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? **No**.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No**. (e.g., no mention of obtaining means, writing notes, etc.)
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? While the post indicates a high level of suicidal feeling, it does not specify imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") in a way that suggests a concrete step towards action. The withdrawal statement is a symptom, not a direct action or plan.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current feelings and a general desire for the future (""out of my misery"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? **No**.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains clear and explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to end suffering (""most suicidal I've been,"" ""want to be out of my misery""). However, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, or an imminent action. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to explicit suicidal statements, but does not reach 'Behavior' due to the absence of a plan/method/imminent action, nor 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.

- Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life: The post explicitly states ""I will kill my bullie,"" ""I will kill her,"" and asks for ""suggestion of how to murder her."" The phrase ""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others"" is grammatically awkward but seems to refer to a type of violence directed outwards, not inwards.
- Emotional indicators: Extreme frustration, anger, and a desire for peace by eliminating the perceived source of distress.
- Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user is asking for suggestions on ""how to murder her,"" indicating a desire to formulate a plan.
- References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts by the person writing the post.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
- Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? No, the post explicitly mentions killing *another person*, not the self.
- Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the user expresses a desire to kill someone else to ""finally live my life in peace.""
- If unclear, consider emotional context: The emotional context is severe distress and homicidal ideation, not suicidal ideation.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
- Are specific methods mentioned? No specific method is mentioned, but the user is actively soliciting suggestions for murder methods.
- Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No, just asking for suggestions.
- Does the post suggest imminent intent? Yes, ""I will kill her"" is stated, and the request for suggestions implies a desire to act.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
- Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? Current/future intentions (""I will kill her"").
- Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No past attempts by the poster on themselves.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The crucial rule states: ""The suicide risk applies only to the person writing the post, not others mentioned."" This post expresses a clear intent to harm or kill *another person*, not the self.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death/suicide/self-harm:** ""I'm on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""I just want to end it all."" (Explicit and strong implication).
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""cannot do this anymore,"" ""mental health really bad,"" ""stress,"" ""disappointment and failure."" (Hopelessness, despair, self-worth issues).
    *   **Specific plans/methods/preparations:** ""I know exactly what to do."" (This is a key phrase implying a formulated plan or method, even if not detailed).
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to end it all.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: Not unclear; intent is very explicit.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No specific *type* of method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No explicit preparation or action is described.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? ""I'm on the verge of suicide"" suggests immediacy. Crucially, ""I know exactly what to do"" strongly implies that a *plan* or *method* has been identified and is ready, even if the details are not shared. This phrase elevates it beyond mere ideation into the realm of having a cognitive plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm on the verge,"" ""I want to end it all"").

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. Explicit suicidal intent is present.
    *   **Ideation:** Ruled out. While there's strong ideation, the phrase ""I know exactly what to do"" indicates the presence of a specific plan or method in the person's mind, which goes beyond the definition of Ideation (""without specific plans or actions"").
    *   **Behavior:** This fits. The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""on the verge of suicide,"" ""want to end it all"") combined with the statement ""I know exactly what to do,"" which strongly implies the existence of a specific plan or method, even if not detailed. This aligns with the ""Behavior"" definition that includes ""a specific plan or method.""
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past attempt is described.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' While there is severe distress, there is no implied intent to die. The intent is to be ""normal"" and for negative aspects of life to be removed.

It expresses a desperate desire for relief from these feelings and for a fundamental change in identity (""make me normal,"" ""take all gayness away all gender disphoria all depresion everything negetive out my life""). However, it *lacks any explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent*. There is no mention of wanting to die, end life, or self-harm. The user is seeking a miracle to remove their pain and perceived abnormalities, not to cease to exist.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" directly implies the poster is experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings related to their pain, seeking validation or shared experience.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: Severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The chronic pain and hopelessness, combined with the explicit mention of ""suicidal,"" strongly points to ideation.

Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

The post clearly expresses suicidal thoughts and feelings (""if I die then I die,"" ""not worth pushing my life further"") which are passive in nature. It explicitly states a *lack of plans* to end life. While stopping doctor visits is an action, it's framed as passive acceptance of death (""willing to accept when my time has come"") rather than an active step or preparation for a specific suicidal method.

I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore. I can barely sleep without waking up in the middle of the night for no obvious reason. I think it's time for me to accept defeat.",1,ideation,"**CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or a clear statement of imminent intent. The questions about suicide being ""appropriate now"" reflect a strong ideation, but not a concrete step towards action. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation'.

453,Star Wars just gave me a reason not to kill myself :). So Disney just announced they'll be releasing a Star Wars dozen films/tv shows in the coming years and it's all I've ever wanted in life :) That should hopefully postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so lol. I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, ""not to kill myself"", ""postpone any suicide attempts"".
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses relief and excitement due to Star Wars news, which is presented as a reason *not* to engage in suicidal behavior. This implies an underlying struggle with suicidal thoughts/actions.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** Yes, ""postpone any suicide attempts"". The use of the plural ""attempts"" and the need to ""postpone"" them strongly implies that suicide attempts are a known behavior or recurring risk for the individual.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"" are explicit mentions.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? The post states a reason *not* to kill themselves, which implies that the desire to die or not be alive was present or is a recurring issue.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, it suggests *postponement* of intent.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to *future postponement* of *past/potential future attempts*. The phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so"" clearly indicates that the *act* of attempting suicide is a relevant and recurring concern for the user.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) and mere thoughts (Ideation) because it explicitly references ""suicide attempts"" as something that needs to be postponed. This indicates a history of or strong propensity for the *action* of attempting suicide.
    *   It does not describe a current specific plan, method, or imminent intent (Behavior).
    *   However, the phrase ""postpone any suicide attempts"" directly points to the *behavior* of attempting suicide. While it doesn't detail a specific past attempt, it acknowledges the *existence* of such actions in the user's life or as a recurring risk. The category 'Attempt' covers descriptions of past suicide attempts. The user is stating that this news will prevent them from engaging in these *attempts*, implying that such attempts are a real possibility or have occurred. This direct reference to ""attempts"" (plural) as something to be postponed aligns best with the 'Attempt' category, as it signifies that the *act* of attempting suicide is part of the individual's risk profile or history.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent even without a method? The phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" indicates current intent, but it does not specify *imminent* timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") that would typically push it into the 'Behavior' category without a method.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""I'm going to kill myself"").
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
*   The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal intent (""I'm going to kill myself""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'.
*   However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or actions taken, nor does it specify imminent timing that would classify it as 'Behavior'.
*   It does not describe a past suicide attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.
*   Therefore, the post fits the definition of 'Ideation': ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., 'I want to die,' 'I’m going to die soon') without specific plans or actions.""

    *   **Emotional indicators**: ""endless misery of depression,"" ""feeling like shit,"" ""stress me out even more,"" ""no end to anything,"" ""tearing me apart."" These indicate severe distress, hopelessness, and despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations**: None are mentioned. There is no indication of a specific way the person intends to die, nor any actions taken or preparations made.
    *   **References to past attempts**: The phrase ""Feel like dying again"" refers to a recurring feeling or state of mind, not a past initiated action or attempt.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die.

    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No. ""Feel like dying again"" indicates a return to a state of ideation, not a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    *   **Indicator**: This category is too low. The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal intent (""Feel like dying again,"" ""Just kill me""), which goes beyond general distress or vague references to death.
    *   **Ideation**: This category fits well. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and feelings (""Feel like dying again,"" ""Just kill me"") and severe emotional distress, but it lacks any specific plan, method, preparations, or imminent timing. It expresses a strong desire to end life without concrete steps.
    *   **Behavior**: This category is too high. There is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparations, or imminent intent (e.g., ""I'm going to do it tonight""). The desire to die is strong, but it's not accompanied by an action plan.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post mentions ""smell of a Dead Body"" but this refers to a landlord's report, not the poster's state or intent. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, or a desire to die. The phrases ""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""I want to leave,"" and ""I have no money to just walk out or i would"" clearly indicate a desire to escape a living situation, not to end life.
*   **Emotional indicators:** Extreme fatigue (""I'm so tired,"" ""I've probably slept an hour every night""), mental distress (""My heads messing with me""), feeling tortured (""I cant take this torture from these people""), paranoia (""My neighbors have been purposely keeping me awake,"" ""everyone is in on it but me""), hopelessness regarding their living situation (""I don't know what options I have left,"" ""I have no money to just walk out"").

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No. The focus is on escaping the current living situation.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The distress is severe, but the intent is clearly focused on escaping the *situation*, not on ending life.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No. The intent is to escape the living situation.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current distress and a desire to escape the present living situation.
*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post expresses severe distress, paranoia, and a feeling of being trapped and tortured by their living situation. The repeated desire is to ""leave this place"" or ""walk out"" of their apartment. There is no explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent, no mention of wanting to die, and no plans or actions related to self-harm or suicide. The hopelessness is clearly tied to their inability to escape their current living circumstances due to financial constraints. This aligns with the definition of 'Indicator' as it shows general distress and hopelessness about a situation without a clear desire to die.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""Possible suicide date is in July."" It also says, ""Too bad I'm fucking debating it,"" which confirms active suicidal thoughts.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""My parents don't love me,"" ""I have nobody :),"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope',"" ""I don't even know who I am anymore if I'm being honest."" These indicate severe despair, loneliness, identity issues, and hopelessness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A ""possible suicide date is in July"" is mentioned. This is a specific temporal component of a plan. No specific method or preparation (e.g., tools, actions taken) is mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** No mention of past attempts.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""Possible suicide date is in July"" is an explicit mention of suicide.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the mention of a ""suicide date"" and ""debating it"" directly implies a desire to end life.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, ""in July"" is a future date, not imminent (e.g., ""tonight""). However, the mention of a ""possible suicide date"" constitutes a specific part of a plan.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a future intention (""in July"").
    *   Are past attempts described? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This category is for general distress without explicit suicidal intent. The post explicitly mentions ""suicide date,"" so it's beyond this.
    *   **Ideation:** This category involves explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or actions. While the post doesn't mention a *method* or *preparation*, it specifies a ""possible suicide date."" This is a concrete temporal element of a plan. It's more specific than general ideation like ""I want to die"" or ""I'm going to die soon"" (the Ideation example).
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires explicit suicidal thoughts plus either (1) a specific plan or method, (2) preparations or actions taken, or (3) strong intent with imminent timing. The phrase ""Possible suicide date is in July"" falls under the criterion of ""a specific plan."" Even without a method, setting a potential date is a specific element of planning. It moves beyond just thinking about suicide to considering *when* it might occur.
    *   **Attempt:** This category describes a past suicide attempt. The post refers to a future date, not a past action.

    Based on the analysis, the mention of a ""possible suicide date"" makes the suicidal intent more concrete and specific than mere ideation. It indicates a level of planning, fitting the ""specific plan"" criterion for the 'Behavior' category, even without a method or imminent timing.

*   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and that seeing happy people ""makes me suicidal."" This clearly indicates the presence of suicidal ideation. However, it explicitly states, ""I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin."" This statement negates any immediate plan, method, or intent to act, and there are no descriptions of past attempts. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly, as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans, actions, or imminent intent.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post explicitly states, ""I tried to cut myself last night."" Cutting oneself is a form of self-harm, and ""tried to"" indicates an action was initiated.

    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** The method is ""cut myself."" The phrase ""tried to cut myself"" indicates an action was taken.
    *   **References to past attempts, including incomplete or interrupted ones:** ""I tried to cut myself last night"" clearly describes a past initiated action that was likely incomplete or interrupted (implied by ""tried to""). The statement ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" confirms this was a new, initiated self-harm behavior.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""tried to cut myself"" is a concrete self-harm action. While the stated motivation is ""wanted to feel something real"" (often associated with non-suicidal self-injury), the categories for suicide risk include actions that are initiated and self-destructive, especially when occurring during a ""breakdown."" The 'Attempt' category specifically includes ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Not explicitly stated, but the action of trying to cut oneself during a breakdown is a severe self-destructive act.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes, ""cut myself.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Yes, ""I tried to cut myself last night"" signifies an action was *initiated*.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? ""last night"" refers to a past event.
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, ""I tried to cut myself last night"" describes a past, initiated action that was incomplete or interrupted.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect, as a concrete self-harm action was initiated.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect, as the post describes an action, not just thoughts.
    *   **Behavior:** Incorrect. 'Behavior' refers to current plans, methods, or imminent intent. This post describes an action that *already occurred*.
    *   **Attempt:** This category defines: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions (e.g., 'I tried to hang myself but stopped'). A concrete action must have been initiated with suicidal intent."" The phrase ""I tried to cut myself last night"" fits this definition perfectly as a past, initiated, and likely incomplete or self-interrupted self-harm action. The example provided in the definition, ""I put a belt around my neck tonight but stopped before I passed out,"" is very similar in nature, describing an initiated self-harm act where the full intent was not realized. Even if the primary stated intent wasn't death, initiating a physical self-harm act during severe distress falls under the highest risk category for an *action*.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? While ""plan to kill myself"" indicates intent, it does not specify *imminent* timing (like ""tonight"" or ""now"") that would push it into the 'Behavior' category without a method. It's a statement of intent, but lacks the immediacy or concrete details of a plan or action.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current/future intentions (""plan to kill myself"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** This is incorrect because the post explicitly states suicidal intent (""plan to kill myself"").
    *   **Ideation:** This category is defined as ""explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., 'I want to die,' 'I’m going to die soon') without specific plans or actions."" The phrase ""plan to kill myself"" clearly falls under explicit suicidal thoughts/feelings. It does *not* include a specific method, preparations, or imminent timing that would elevate it to 'Behavior'.
    *   **Behavior:** This category requires a ""specific plan or method,"" ""preparations or actions taken,"" or ""strong intent with imminent timing."" The post lacks a specific method or preparations, and while it shows strong intent, it doesn't specify *imminent* timing (e.g., ""tonight""). The word ""plan"" here refers to the intention, not a detailed, actionable strategy.
    *   **Attempt:** This is incorrect as the post describes current intent, not a past attempt.

Based on the definitions, the post expresses explicit suicidal intent without detailing a specific method, preparations, or imminent timing. Therefore, it best fits the 'Ideation' category.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** Yes, ""killing myself soon"" is an explicit mention of suicide and a clear implication of wanting to end one's life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** Not explicitly stated emotions, but the context implies severe distress and a sense of hopelessness regarding intervention (""Nobody'll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"").
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jump"") or preparations (e.g., ""wrote a note"") are mentioned.

    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes**, ""killing myself soon.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' (Not unclear, intent is explicit).

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? **No**.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **No**.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? The word ""soon"" implies a future action, but not necessarily ""tonight"" or ""now."" However, the discussion about *how* to inform others about the impending act (""let folks know you'll be killing yourself soon or just surprise em"") indicates a strong intent to act and a contemplation of the logistics surrounding the *event* itself, rather than just a fleeting thought. The statement ""Nobody'll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"" further reinforces strong intent and a dismissal of intervention.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? **Future intentions** (""killing myself soon"").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? **No**.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Ruled out. There is explicit suicidal intent, not just general distress.
    *   **Ideation:** While there are suicidal thoughts, the post goes beyond mere thoughts. The user is contemplating the *execution* of the act (""killing myself soon"") and discussing the *logistics* of its aftermath (how to inform others). This indicates a level of decision-making and planning that moves beyond passive ideation.
    *   **Behavior:** This category includes explicit suicidal thoughts plus strong intent. Although a specific method is not mentioned, and ""soon"" is not as immediately imminent as ""tonight,"" the post demonstrates ""strong intent"" by discussing the practicalities of the suicide (""let folks know,"" ""surprise em"") and dismissing intervention (""no worries of being stopped""). The focus is on the *act* itself and its implications, not just the desire to die. This bridges the gap between thoughts and actions, aligning with the 'Behavior' definition.
    *   **Attempt:** Ruled out. No past attempt is described.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post explicitly states a desire to die (""I want to die""), which indicates suicidal intent. However, it does not mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, or actions taken. The phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" suggests a barrier to acting on the ideation. This fits the definition of 'Ideation' which includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings without specific plans or actions. It does not qualify as 'Behavior' because there's no plan, action, or imminent timing, nor as 'Attempt' as no past action is described. It is beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit suicidal intent.

This combination of explicit intent, a specific plan/method, and signs of preparation/imminent timing fits the definition of 'Behavior'.

Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious.

Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff.

For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'.

The post clearly expresses suicidal intent (""I just want to definitely die""). This moves it beyond 'Indicator'. It also goes beyond simple 'Ideation' because the user is actively *seeking information* on ""how to die."" This search for a method or means is a concrete step towards planning or preparation, fitting the definition of 'Behavior' which includes ""preparations or actions taken"" or ""a specific plan or method"" (even if the method isn't named, the active search for one is a behavioral step towards it). It does not describe a past attempt, so it's not 'Attempt'.

These are strong and explicit expressions of suicidal ideation and intent.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""tired of everything,"" ""tired of buying time,"" ""tired of fighting to heal,"" ""don't care,"" ""constant fear and pain,"" ""dissociation."" These indicate severe hopelessness, despair, and emotional exhaustion.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** No specific method or concrete preparation for a suicide act is mentioned. The ""plans to look forward to"" are explicitly stated as a way to ""buy that much time,"" meaning to delay, not to execute.
    *   **References to past attempts:** The phrase ""if I do attempt again"" directly and clearly indicates that the individual has made a suicide attempt in the past.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes. ""will to die,"" ""if I do it,"" ""if I do attempt again.""

    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No. The post explicitly states, ""I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions?
        *   Past event: ""if I do attempt again"" clearly refers to a past suicide attempt.
        *   Current feelings: ""will to die,"" ""tired of fighting.""
        *   Future intention: ""If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out,"" ""I'm not going to fail.""
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? Yes, the phrase ""if I do attempt again"" confirms a past attempt.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    Based on the analysis, the post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""if I do attempt again""). According to the definitions, the 'Attempt' category states: ""The post describes a past suicide attempt, including incomplete or self-interrupted actions... If the post also mentions current plans or ideation, still classify as 'attempt' if a past attempt is clear."" This post clearly mentions a past attempt, even while also expressing current ideation and future intent.

""Going by my plan, I still need to wait another 480 days"" indicates a formulated plan with timing. ""Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there"" mentions another specific method and a location, alongside a strong, immediate urge.
-   **References to past attempts**: No.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
-   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, explicitly ""take my life"" and strongly implied desire to end life.
-   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes.
-   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' This post clearly goes beyond 'indicator'.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
-   Are specific methods mentioned? Yes. ""a gun to the head"" and ""grab a kitchen knife.""
-   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? Not explicitly actions taken, but ""Going by my plan"" indicates a formulated plan, and ""Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there"" indicates a strong and growing imminent intent with a specific method and location.
-   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' Yes, ""But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there"" strongly suggests imminent intent and a struggle against it, coupled with a specific method.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

-   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""how and when I'm going to take my life""). It also includes specific methods (""gun to the head,"" ""kitchen knife"") and references to a ""plan."" Crucially, the statement ""But I can't wait any more. Each day I've been more tempted to just grab a kitchen knife and do it there"" indicates a strong, escalating, and imminent intent to act, bridging the gap between thoughts and concrete action. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Behavior'. It's not merely ideation because of the specific methods and the imminent intent, and it's not an attempt as no action has been initiated.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"") and a clear desire to escape existence (""I don't want to be me anymore,"" ""I feel like i've seen enough of my future to want to continue""). However, it does not mention any specific plans, methods, preparations, or actions taken. It fits the definition of 'Ideation' perfectly: ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings (e.g., 'I want to die,' 'I’m going to die soon') without specific plans or actions.""

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrase ""I feel like he'll be better off without me"" strongly implies a desire to be absent or dead. The phrase ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" is a very strong and direct implication of suicidal intent, meaning ending his life.
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""Can't take it anymore,"" ""failed my son,"" ""worthless as fuck,"" ""so much pain"" (implied by ""Can't take it anymore""). These show severe hopelessness, despair, and low self-worth.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None are mentioned.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None are mentioned.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" is a strong implication of wanting to end his life.
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I feel like he'll be better off without me"" and ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: severe distress with implied intent leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator.' The emotional context is severe distress, and the intent is strongly implied.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? No specific timing is mentioned.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events (e.g., ""I tried last week"") or current/future intentions (e.g., ""I want to do it now"")? It refers to current/ongoing thoughts and intentions (""I've been thinking about..."").
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones (e.g., ""I started but stopped"")? No.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:** Based on the analysis, the post contains strongly implied suicidal thoughts and feelings (""I've been thinking about just getting it over with,"" ""he'll be better off without me"") but lacks any specific plan, method, preparations, actions taken, or imminent timing. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because of the clear implied intent to end his life, but it doesn't describe a plan or action (Behavior) or a past attempt (Attempt).

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Both. The post details multiple past attempts (at 15, at 21, ""just recently"" with rope) and describes a very recent, initiated, and interrupted action (""Today, I have an exit bag set up...

*   **Emotional indicators**: ""Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile,"" ""I'm a garbage person,"" ""I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything"" indicate severe hopelessness, self-loathing, and despair.
*   **Specific plans/methods/preparations**: None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? Yes, ""should just end my life"" explicitly mentions ending life.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""should just end my life"") and a desire to die. However, it does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or indications of imminent action. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation'. It goes beyond general distress (Indicator) because of the explicit suicidal statement, but doesn't include the concrete elements required for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Not an Indicator, as there is explicit suicidal intent.
    *   **Ideation:** While it contains suicidal thoughts, the phrase ""I'm about to kill myself"" goes beyond mere ideation. It implies an imminent intention to act, even without a specific method mentioned. The definition of Ideation states it ""stops short of concrete steps."" The imminence here suggests a step beyond just thoughts.
    *   **Behavior:** This category applies when there are explicit suicidal thoughts *plus* ""strong intent with imminent timing (e.g., 'I want to be gone tonight') even without a method."" The phrase ""I'm about to kill myself"" perfectly fits ""strong intent with imminent timing.""
    *   **Attempt:** Not an Attempt, as it describes an impending action, not a past one.

Based on the analysis, the post expresses explicit suicidal intent with a strong indication of imminent action, which aligns with the ""Behavior"" category.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" is a direct expression of wanting to act on suicidal thoughts.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? While there is a strong desire to act (""do it already""), there is no specific timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or method that would classify it as imminent intent for the 'Behavior' category without a method. It's a frustrated internal push to act, rather than a declaration of immediate execution.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to current/future intentions (""I should... do it already"").
*   Are past attempts described? No.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
*   The post clearly expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to act on them.
*   It does not include any specific plans, methods, preparations, or descriptions of an actual attempt.
*   While there is strong intent, it lacks the specific timing or concrete action/plan required for the 'Behavior' category. It's a statement of a strong desire to transition from ideation to action, but it remains within the realm of thoughts and feelings without concrete steps.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"**Thinking Process**

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:**
        *   ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January."" (Explicit mention of suicide)
        *   ""now it time to stop the lie and end it."" (Strong implication of ending life)
        *   ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" (Explicit mention of suicide, specific method)
        *   ""During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself)."" (Self-harm, but not explicitly stated as a suicide *attempt*)
    *   **Emotional indicators:** The user states, ""I'm done and happy,"" ""I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time."" While the emotional state is complex and contradictory, the *intent* to end life is clear and explicitly stated, overriding the stated lack of sadness.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:**
        *   ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January."" (Past plan, not carried out)
        *   ""So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" (Current specific plan, method, and location)
        *   ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car"" (Specific preparations/tools)
    *   **References to past attempts:**
        *   ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today."" (Describes a past *plan* that was *not* carried out, so not a past *attempt* as defined).
        *   ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more..."" (Describes self-harm, but not framed as an attempt to end life).

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? **Yes.** ""I planned to kill myself,"" ""end it,"" ""I plan to hang myself.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? **Yes.** ""I'm done,"" ""end it,"" ""I won't be able to continue.""
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: The intent is very clear and explicit, despite the stated emotional state.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? **Yes.** ""hang myself,"" ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe.""
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? **Yes.** ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car.""
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? The phrases ""now it time to stop the lie and end it"" and ""I won't be able to continue"" combined with ""Everything is ready"" strongly suggest current and imminent intent, even without a specific date/time like ""tonight.""

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? The post describes a past plan that was not executed (""I planned to kill myself in January. But I didn't"") and then shifts to current intent and future plans/preparations: ""now it time to stop the lie and end it,"" ""So I plan to hang myself... Everything is ready.""
    *   Are past attempts described, including incomplete ones? No. The January plan was explicitly stated as *not* carried out. The cutting was self-harm, not described as an attempt to end life.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   **Indicator:** Incorrect. There is explicit suicidal intent, specific plans, and preparations.
    *   **Ideation:** Incorrect. The post goes beyond mere thoughts or feelings by detailing specific plans, methods, and preparations.
    *   **Behavior:** This category fits perfectly. The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""I plan to hang myself"") and includes both a specific plan/method (""hang myself... after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe"") and preparations (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""). The stated intent (""now it time to stop the lie and end it"") reinforces this.
    *   **Attempt:** Incorrect. The post describes plans and preparations for a *future* action, not a past or ongoing action that was initiated with suicidal intent. The past plan was not carried out, and the self-harm was not described as a suicide attempt.

1.  **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    *   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The post mentions ""die"" in a philosophical context (""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"") and expresses a wish to ""never be born."" However, it explicitly states, ""but at the same time don't really want to die.""
    *   **Emotional indicators:** ""dumbest shit ever,"" ""no point"" – indicates frustration, nihilism, or existential despair.
    *   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None.
    *   **References to past attempts:** None.

2.  **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
    *   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No. While it questions the point of life and expresses a wish not to have been born, it directly contradicts suicidal intent by stating ""don't really want to die.""
    *   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No, the post explicitly states the opposite.
    *   If unclear, consider emotional context: The emotional context is one of existential questioning and despair, but the explicit negation of wanting to die prevents it from being classified as ideation.

3.  **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
    *   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
    *   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No.

4.  **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
    *   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? Current philosophical musings. No past attempts are described.

5.  **CATEGORY REASONING:**
    *   The post expresses general distress, existential despair, and questions the meaning of life, but it explicitly states ""don't really want to die."" This crucial phrase directly negates suicidal intent. Therefore, it lacks explicit or strongly implied expressions of suicidal intent. It fits the definition of 'Indicator' as it shows general distress and vague references to death/futility without a clear desire to die. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because suicidal intent is not present; in fact, it's explicitly denied.

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** No mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. There are no strong implications of wanting to end one’s life. The post focuses on social shame and anxiety about starting a new school.
*   **Emotional indicators:** The post expresses strong feelings of shame (""I am very ashamed,"" ""I know I messed up big time""), fear (""I am afraid of everyone will think of me""), and distress (""I really need help,"" ""it's just fucked up"").
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** None mentioned.
*   **References to past attempts:** None mentioned.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned or strongly implied? No. The user is seeking advice on how to cope with social judgment and shame, not expressing a desire to die.
*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? No.
*   If unclear, consider emotional context: The emotional context is severe social distress and anxiety, but it does not convey any suicidal intent.

*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post clearly indicates significant emotional distress, shame, and anxiety related to a social situation. However, it completely lacks any explicit or strongly implied suicidal intent, thoughts, plans, or references to past attempts. It fits the definition of 'Indicator' because it shows general distress without a clear desire to die.

*   Are there direct or implied expressions of wanting to die or not be alive? Yes, the statement ""they don't let you kill yourself"" directly implies a desire to die.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent? No, it expresses a general frustration about being prevented from acting, rather than an immediate plan or intent to act.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
*   Does this refer to past events or current/future intentions? It refers to a current desire/frustration. No past attempts are described.

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post explicitly states ""they don't let you kill yourself,"" which is a clear expression of suicidal thought and desire. However, it does not include any specific plan, method, preparations, actions taken, or imminent timing. It expresses a wish or frustration about not being able to act on that wish. This aligns perfectly with the definition of 'Ideation': ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts or feelings... without specific plans or actions."" It goes beyond 'Indicator' due to the explicit mention of ""kill yourself"" and desire to do so, but does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (no plan/action) or 'Attempt' (no past action described).

*   **Key elements**: The post expresses extreme loneliness, a feeling of being uncared for, self-loathing (""spoiled piece of shit""), and a direct plea to die (""pls fucking end me""). The phrase ""till i say im going to do it"" implies a history or current consideration of suicidal action. The phrase ""before the day"" indicates an imminent temporal context for the desire to die.

**EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
*   Is suicide explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") or strongly implied (e.g., ""I want it to be over,"" ""I’m going to die soon"")? Yes, ""pls fucking end me"" is an explicit and strong expression of wanting to die. ""im going to do it"" also strongly implies suicidal intent.

**PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
*   Are specific methods mentioned? No.
*   Are there signs of preparation or actions taken? No.
*   Does the post suggest imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method? If so, lean toward 'behavior' over 'ideation.' Yes, ""before the day"" strongly suggests imminent intent.

**TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

**CATEGORY REASONING**:
The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""pls fucking end me,"" ""im going to do it"") and a strong sense of imminent timing (""before the day""). While no specific plan or method is mentioned, the combination of explicit intent and imminent timing fits the definition of 'Behavior': ""The post includes explicit or strongly implied suicidal thoughts plus either: (1) a specific plan or method, (2) preparations or actions taken, or (3) strong intent with imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") even without a method.""

*   **Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or strong implications of wanting to end one’s life:** The phrase ""I hope it'll be me next"" in the context of stabbings strongly implies a desire for death. The explicit mention of ""suicide"" and the desire to avoid ""shame"" associated with it, by hoping for an external cause of death, further reinforces suicidal ideation.
*   **Emotional indicators:** Shame (""bring shame in the family"").
*   **Specific plans, methods, or preparations:** A method (""stabbing"") is mentioned, but it's something the user *hopes* will happen to them, not a plan they intend to execute themselves. There are no signs of preparation or actions taken by the user.

**CATEGORY REASONING:**
The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a strong desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next,"" ""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family with a suicide""). It clearly expresses a wish to end one's life. However, it does not describe a specific plan *by the user* to commit suicide, nor any preparations or actions taken by the user. The ""stabbing"" is a desired external event, not a self-inflicted method. Therefore, it fits the definition of 'Ideation' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts without concrete plans or actions initiated by the individual. It does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' because there's no active plan or action taken by the user, nor for 'Attempt' as no past attempt is described.

The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""I tried to kill myself last night... but EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE""). This fits the definition of 'Attempt' which includes ""incomplete or self-interrupted actions.""
